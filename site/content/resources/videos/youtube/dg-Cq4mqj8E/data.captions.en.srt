1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:09,690
there we go so what what I normally do

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:13,200
for students is I do I schedule a

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,289
half-hour or a 1-hour tech check the

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,749
week before the class and sorry any of

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,900
these teething problems so the types of

6
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:24,089
problems that I sometimes get just like

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,149
if you want to join a Google hangout or

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,960
you want to do any of these meeting

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:34,980
tools you need an account enabled for

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,430
the platform and in this case Microsoft

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,410
will let you use any account you want so

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,150
you can use a gmail account you can use

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,400
a hotmail account you can use anything

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,920
if it's not already enabled for I might

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,000
as a Microsoft account they'll ask you

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,680
to create the the just the profile for

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,780
it so it'll be the same email address so

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,750
your your Gmail or your your whatever

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,400
mail your company mail and if your

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,060
company has as your Active Directory

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,490
that's all done already and you'll just

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,710
be able to use your corporate

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,689
credentials to log in so your students

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,420
if you're working with a big enterprise

25
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,530
customer quite often they already have

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,350
office 365 they can just use exactly the

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,249
same credentials that they use to log

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,549
into teams that they use in the office

29
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:34,740
to log into teams so what they'll get if

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,780
I share my screen and then pop it back

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,829
up because it helpfully minimizes it for

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:45,420
me yes they will get a little drop-down

33
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,670
list at the top right here of teams so

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,369
if if both the accounts are the same or

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,939
you are a member of two teams accounts

36
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,859
under the account you're logged in as

37
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,209
you'll get a list of the different

38
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:04,259
places you can go so I have my own

39
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:07,649
company tenant in in Azure and I also

40
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,890
have I can access the Microsoft tenant

41
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:14,460
and then I have two customers in here

42
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,120
who have added me to their tenant yes.we

43
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,780
if the account you've

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,069
I already had a Microsoft enabled for it

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,920
and has already been added to a

46
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:30,599
customer's account or your own you'll

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:34,540
see that there I know we lost their

48
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,280
child's I think yes child lost Charles

49
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,349
he's trying to get something sorted

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,650
Charles has office 365 under his own

51
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,659
brand and so he has his scrum crazy in

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,440
here as well so you'll see whatever

53
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:54,670
makes sense at the time it is key to

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,160
know that the only problem I really ever

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,440
run into is the one that a couple of you

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,959
have run into that the email address you

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,750
log into teams and the email address you

58
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,670
were invited on or different in that

59
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,060
case you can see on the right-hand side

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,329
here that Jose does not have a little

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,500
red dot and when I roll over his picture

62
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:20,829
oh look they fit all of the PII is

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,590
removed so I cannot see his email

64
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:29,470
address whereas if I roll over yourself

65
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,599
I see that you're in a call it has the

66
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,120
presence information it has your email

67
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,239
address and I can do a direct video call

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,000
email and message you that's how you

69
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,780
know they've come in in a way that you

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,870
can do all of the the things that we

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,199
want to be able to do okay if you just

72
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,849
want to have a meeting in teams then it

73
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,250
doesn't matter how they come in they can

74
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,709
just use the invite link anybody can

75
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,910
come in with any link north indication

76
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:03,459
required okay and so that's how Jose has

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,709
come in so we can both coexist in the

78
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,090
same thing as well so if you do have a

79
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,790
student that has a particularly

80
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,620
difficult problem it's not the end of

81
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,290
the world that they can't see everything

82
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,269
else that that we can see we can we can

83
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,389
figure out something something for them

84
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,430
I did have a student earlier who had

85
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:24,789
that sort of problem and he didn't sort

86
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,169
it out till the the first break when he

87
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,930
could reboot his computer or whatever

88
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,100
the problem was

89
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,840
we didn't have a problem until then our

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,910
there's some new features in teams since

91
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,970
Magdalena I don't know if you can see

92
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:47,430
nine pictures yet while there's not nine

93
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:51,810
people in but on my machine up here I

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:54,000
can see six five people because they've

95
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,690
added the capability to have up to nine

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,699
people being seen

97
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,979
cream you can also see I've got raise

98
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,400
your hand functionality oh you get four

99
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:08,580
so it's it's still rolling out it's not

100
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,320
for everybody yet but over the next week

101
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,599
it's going to go in to finish rolling

102
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,360
out yeah yeah I saw I saw you did that

103
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,099
so you got a hand raised functionality

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,289
and you can see it on the right here and

105
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,910
I can actually go in and lower your hand

106
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,400
once I've dealt with whatever that

107
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,729
question is and the people with their

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,050
hand raised pop to the top of the list

109
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,430
which is quite handy so you can see

110
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,010
people and then you can see on the

111
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,690
picture down here and you might be able

112
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,030
to see that or you might not but Hegel

113
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,780
Charles has raised his hand so you'll

114
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,360
get the hand popping up there I mean

115
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,340
these are just I know zoom has some of

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,479
those features as well it's just nice

117
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,360
features to make sure that we have so

118
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,610
the thing that I think are the useful

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,860
features in here one one is the security

120
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,849
is obviously it means it's more

121
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,560
difficult but it is secure if I don't

122
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:07,380
want anybody else to come into this

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,960
meeting they can't get in which

124
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,849
obviously has its downside as we've seen

125
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:18,930
and but on the left hand side here you

126
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:20,759
can if if you're m oh and I see oh no

127
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,229
just it's just who's they that wouldn't

128
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,750
so you won't be able to click on here

129
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,729
Jose and see what we see and but you'll

130
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,120
be able to follow along that's why I'm

131
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:33,090
sharing so if I click on teams and you

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,370
can see the teams that are within the

133
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:40,229
tenants that you're connected to so I'm

134
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,820
connected to my one obviously a mr.

135
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,660
scrum crazy will have

136
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,520
his company name in here as well oh yeah

137
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,490
he's not able to get his camera working

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,790
that's okay and you can see the

139
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,950
different teams for different classes

140
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,550
that I have run or I'm running and at

141
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:03,000
the moment we're in the general channel

142
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,880
of this live virtual face-to-face on ms

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,240
teams that I created for scrum the dark

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,520
group and you'll be able to see that

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,700
there is a call on going because in the

146
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,710
general rule there's a little light

147
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,440
which shows that the the calls running

148
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,270
and anybody can come in and join that

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,610
call and see that it's being recorded

150
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,180
and who's recording it all of that

151
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,790
information is just provided in here and

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,090
you'll notice that I can see Charles's

153
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:37,940
chat from inside of the meeting outside

154
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,940
of the meeting and I can actually reply

155
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:46,980
from outside of the meeting as well into

156
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,710
that that chat that's that's can be

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,260
pretty useful especially if students are

158
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,210
in a call and you want them to come back

159
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,040
you can just ping them in their chat

160
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,600
without having to actually join the call

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,960
as well and you can add applications to

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,790
teams

163
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:09,090
aerosol Russell's been running a bunch

164
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:12,750
of classes on teams with me and he had

165
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:16,050
the unfortunate happenings of zoom going

166
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:20,480
down on Sunday for a class on the second

167
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:24,180
day of your class yes yeah so we set up

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,310
in record time a team and got all his

169
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,440
students in in order to carry on the

170
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,960
class on the second day so to have a

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:36,450
backup anyway because these things

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,310
definitely happen and I know of a couple

173
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,440
of times when teams has gone down as

174
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,200
well I mean every platform is going to

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,210
have these kind of things you just need

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,660
to be able to pivot when when things go

177
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:53,220
wrong I was just saying that you can add

178
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,790
apps to the to the team and by default

179
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,800
you'll have posts files and Wyck

180
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,499
Wiki is a really really cheap wiki don't

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,839
get your hopes up it's a very cheap

182
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,149
poorly implemented wiki but it might be

183
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,999
good enough for what it is you're doing

184
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,769
I usually just remove it because I don't

185
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:13,679
I don't I don't want the wiki there and

186
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:15,389
so posts and files is the default

187
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,319
they're the only two that cannot be

188
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:22,110
removed if I go to files and you can see

189
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:24,449
I've uploaded the PSM reference guide

190
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,910
here so everybody who's a member of the

191
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:28,529
team will be able to download the files

192
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,170
that are there and they can actually

193
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:34,410
sync them to their desktop as well and

194
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:41,129
so I'm just gonna show you this on my

195
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:42,869
machine so if you've used onedrive

196
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:46,860
you'll know you get a personal onedrive

197
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:48,660
and a corporate onedrive entry if you

198
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,869
log in to both on the same computer and

199
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,759
if you click the sync button here you

200
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:57,389
actually get this other one appears

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,339
which is shared folders from teams or

202
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,160
web sites or SharePoint from different

203
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,790
organizations and and it works exactly

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,610
the same way as onedrive and but there's

205
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,110
I don't think I've synced this one but

206
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,149
if I open up this one which is for one

207
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,519
of my customers you can see there's

208
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,439
general team one team two team 3 it

209
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,429
creates the folders for each of the

210
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:23,009
channels and if I open up it will have

211
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,569
and I uploaded the tech check in there

212
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,259
where I'd recorded it for the customer

213
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:31,230
and I stored the the the roster for the

214
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:35,160
the class and there as well since it was

215
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:39,240
a private class it would not there's not

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,220
a BPI problem sorry a PII problem I have

217
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,399
personal identifiable information if you

218
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,509
for for losing Europe that's a thing we

219
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,370
have to worry about a lot um but for for

220
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:54,889
public classes obviously I wouldn't put

221
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:57,720
there just put the roster em in there

222
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,209
you if you're used if you're used to

223
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,889
using other storage platforms you can

224
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,959
actually just add Dropbox or Google

225
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,670
Drive or whatever you want in there so

226
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,160
you can integrate it with whatever you

227
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,980
want and and I did mention you can add

228
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,199
apps

229
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,500
kind of like an app the storage account

230
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:16,180
but you can actually I mean I'm pretty

231
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,269
sure if you look for it they've got it

232
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,160
and it's a very extensible platform so

233
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:24,550
lots of people are built for it so

234
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,310
there's there's mural there's that wiki

235
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,519
that I was using but also those all

236
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,579
kinds of crazy stuff even Stack Overflow

237
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,620
have built our a plugin for it because

238
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:39,370
they've got corporate Stack Overflow as

239
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,630
well so you can do all kinds of i-i've

240
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,490
not really looked through the whole list

241
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,240
there's tons of things you can get

242
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,079
Trello

243
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,230
right on here and everything just right

244
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,779
on the display and however I am not

245
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,600
using the mural plug-in because the

246
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,820
mural plug-in requires that everybody

247
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,120
login as an authenticated user and I

248
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,329
want people to use the anonymous login

249
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,730
so I don't have to pay a license which

250
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,940
is always good because they're not cheap

251
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,190
from Europe and so if you click on if

252
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,720
you were to go to the same place that

253
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,569
I'm looking at and click on mural you'll

254
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,240
see it will say enter anonymously and I

255
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:22,120
can just enter anonymously or or login

256
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,300
and you get exactly the same experience

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,089
as in a browser and you can even if I

258
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,680
pop this expand tab it will make it

259
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:34,990
relatively fullscreen relatively and if

260
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,550
the students want to pop it out they can

261
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,639
just click go to a website and it will

262
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:43,630
open in a web interface and you can even

263
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,760
chat along with this item and it will

264
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,620
appear as a conversation in the in the

265
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,560
list as well to do with the tab so that

266
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,560
can be quite useful I just did it as I

267
00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:00,699
just did it as I I just added a web page

268
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,370
so you can just add a website so I also

269
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,100
added the scrum guide because you know

270
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,690
that could be useful for students and

271
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,940
the scrum open straight into the

272
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,220
assessment without all of the chrome

273
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,230
surrounding it so that that can help as

274
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,000
well

275
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:20,830
pair is that is that an actual question

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,710
from pep

277
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:27,520
I can't even I can't even wear the right

278
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:30,720
oh I have to go back into the call which

279
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,720
I click here there we go

280
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:44,200
pear pear Pete who's pear ping pear okay

281
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:45,790
did you have a question uh-huh it's okay

282
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,010
I thought there was a question there was

283
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:55,120
an indication to be that there might be

284
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:56,590
a question cool um so you I mean you can

285
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,300
add as many tabs as you want obviously

286
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,920
there's some there's gonna be a

287
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,630
limitation of space and whatever

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,550
resolution people are using and all that

289
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:09,210
that that that governs in here and and

290
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:11,170
when you create a team helpfully

291
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:15,220
Microsoft creates a bunch of stuff

292
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:18,280
behind the team and those are a group

293
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,320
and which is a male enabled and security

294
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,690
enabled group that's created in your

295
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,060
Azure Active Directory and so you can

296
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,540
send email to an email you can actually

297
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,670
I think you click on here and say it's

298
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,280
somewhere around here there we go get

299
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:38,530
email address and it will get me the

300
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:41,260
email address for this channel and if I

301
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,900
send emails to that email address those

302
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,820
things will appear in this channel so

303
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,130
you can do all kinds of some of this

304
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,820
stuff you maybe don't care about from

305
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,220
running a class but there's there's

306
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,340
loads of other features that are above

307
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,960
and beyond just running a class you can

308
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,420
connect it up to a bunch of things I'm

309
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,600
trying to build plugin for teams that

310
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,790
will enable kind of more class centric

311
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,370
stuff that we need and things that I've

312
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,910
done manually so what I do when I'm

313
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,030
running a class is I create a team

314
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,880
that's the first thing I do and then I

315
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,390
give it a nice friendly name and then I

316
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,550
add my students and you can add any

317
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,400
email address you want and it will

318
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,560
invite them so occasionally a student

319
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,270
said oh I can't log in on that email

320
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,940
here's a different email and I just add

321
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:38,590
it I'm not worried about

322
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:41,530
removing the the old one and I use a

323
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:45,400
tagging system in here so let's see if

324
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:48,370
we can tag the folks that are if I

325
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,830
manage team you'll see this 43 people in

326
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:56,320
this team because we had the previous

327
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:58,540
event as well so let's do Session two

328
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,420
and I'm going to create a tag called

329
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,420
session 2 and I'm gonna find where's

330
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,910
Charles make you students and session

331
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,690
two right Delana

332
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:19,840
session two up Ben didn't make it you

333
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,350
Liam Session two Russell's around here

334
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:30,280
somewhere

335
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:32,710
oh there's Peter open this so and one of

336
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,620
the nice things you can do is I all of

337
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,020
the students with students I tagged all

338
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,140
of the facilitators with facilitators

339
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,510
and if there's more than one team I try

340
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,010
and tag the people in team one with team

341
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,060
one team two a team two

342
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:55,600
now in the general tab I can say at and

343
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:57,250
and what what did I call the remember

344
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,680
why I called it now what was that what

345
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:11,440
did I call the session they call it

346
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:13,960
session to session - thank you as soon

347
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,540
as I start typing session you'll see it

348
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,720
comes up with this tag session - six

349
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,070
people are in this tag and you can send

350
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,340
a message and they'll all get that

351
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:27,880
message flagged so I quite often use

352
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:30,100
that to pull people back from their team

353
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,470
rooms because in teams it's not going to

354
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,080
create bake-out rooms for you and then

355
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,150
pool kill the breakout rooms and pull

356
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,300
students back students have to be

357
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,190
responsible for their own time box I've

358
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,870
noticed that it depends how you treat

359
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,150
your students if you let them self

360
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,590
organize they actually will and they'll

361
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,520
keep the time box them cell

362
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,590
if you don't provide any hints and I've

363

every meeting URL and teams is unique

370
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:16,059

team one meeting logo now to say that

406
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,570

wasn't in it I can leave the meeting and

410
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,470

room and we can show everybody how this

415
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,400
works because what you'll see when

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,070
Russell disappears and join this room a

417
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,120
little logo will pop up here that shows

418
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,920

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,300
other no you don't have the okay well

424
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,150
since Russell couldn't follow

425
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:20,190
instructions maybe at Magdalena would

426
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,570
you like to jump into this team one room

427
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:32,460

432
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,720
in a few seconds it will pop come up

433
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,770
with our Magdalena's little letters to

434
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,320
say that she's in this room and you'll

435
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,740

team and then I'm back you can see here

448
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:49,750

450
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:58,560

bring this over here that's okay whether

454
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,770
it would just work for what like I said

455
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,490
I do I do a check tech check with

456
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:17,860
students true the week before cuz that

457
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:20,680
these sorts of things are sometimes sent

458
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,420
to tryouts in they've have so in fact

459
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,740

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,050
email that is not currently a member

462
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:35,170
might mean it will just say add as a

463
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,570
guest at the moment team's doesn't care

464
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,490
what type of account that says you

465
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:44,080
decide that when you accept the

466
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:46,150
invitation so I add that and then in a

467
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,460

468
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,450
have an invite in your email within the

469
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:56,280

I'll see you later you're very welcome

474
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:15,420
Russell sue Wharton yes and what can be

475
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:16,620
done when the team's not joined so I can

476
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,300
set up the teams

477
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:23,520
I can set up the rooms but I can't label

478
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,680
the in that the people I've invited

479
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:31,320
already so I have to do this when they

480
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:34,410
are life understand you labeled you

481
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,450
labeled your team members with the

482
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,230
student 1 yep

483
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,940
student and team 1 general no house

484
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,510
formation to do that in here

485
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,820
only the facilitators do yes but do they

486
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,910
have to be joined in already or can you

487
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,400
do this in preparation of the class no

488
00:24:50,910 --> 00:25:02,180
you can do this already so if I go find

489
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:04,680
I just invited was they from the other

490
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,920
should be another Jose in here somewhere

491
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,710
it is so he's not accepted it yet

492
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,480
and I can go I can go tag them so I can

493
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:18,270
set it up beforehand that's fine and

494
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:21,210
then you'll you'll notice that I can see

495
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,240
information about people that have

496
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,860
joined correctly so I can go check

497
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,020
whether they've joined correctly as well

498
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,650
so I can pre prepare that and maybe

499
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,540
chase people up and if I go I'm gonna

500
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:38,520
see if I can bring this other window

501
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:42,210
across for you to show you Jose do you

502
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,830
mind if I put your is you is it okay to

503
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,620
have your email address on the recording

504
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,840
yeah we just pasted it any way you can

505
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,610
yeah I I'm trying to login anything this

506
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,360
is give me to create a password is that

507
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:56,970
correct if it is not already a Microsoft

508
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,900
account it will ask you to do that if

509
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,610
it's a ad account it'll ask you to login

510
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,910
so troublemakers my account as far as I

511
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,680
know

512
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:13,930
so and you just like diverting no one

513
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:15,820
else okay so if you if you go into as

514
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,370
your active directory you can actually

515
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,230
look up I'm not going to go to the list

516
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,190
of users because it would be more people

517
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:27,370
and random students so and I can't

518
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,960
control what it displays but this is you

519
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,420
would type in the person's name it would

520
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,320
come up with this and at the moment it

521
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:38,560
says invitation accepted no and I had to

522
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,300
resend the invitation and you can also

523
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,420
get the URL and just send them an email

524
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,760
and say here you you've not followed

525
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,190
this process click here to follow the

526
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,280
process bla bla bla so you can make sure

527
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:55,540
everybody set up and before you start

528
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,760
the class to be honest if I do a tech

529
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,220
check the week before I've not really

530
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,830
had any problems with real students I've

531
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,600
only had problems with PS T's same as I

532
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,810

00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:20,350
and I have I have five PS T's in my

535
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:24,330
class which is always fun yet it's it's

536
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,330
called there being a masochist I think

537
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:46,210
that's that's a good question so the

538
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:50,890

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:54,850
three pounds a month for one user for

540
00:27:50,890 --> 00:28:01,230
you like an office 365 business basic

541
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:06,340
account and that gets you unlimited yes

542
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:11,920
okay unlimited guests you can invite now

543
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:16,780
in teams there is a limit you can only

544
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,680
have 5,000 people in one team so you're

545
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,470
not ever

546
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,210
hit back Oh unless you're gonna have a

547
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,100
class with five thousand five thousand

548
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:29,800
and one people in it you're fine all

549
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:32,770
right in in in the team's when you

550
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:37,930
create a channel you can actually have

551
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:40,060
both standard and private channels don't

552
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:43,600
use private channels until you know

553
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,940
exactly how they work okay private

554
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,090
channels are a whole additional

555
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,580
complexity they're actually secured in

556
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,370
their own right so it's almost like

557
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,610
creating a new team inside of your team

558
00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,190
and you get a whole new set of assets

559
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,630
for it they are completely isolated so

560
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,900
if you upload a file in there there's no

561
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:08,650
way anybody else could get access so I

562
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,300
just use the public ones and when people

563
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,090
self organize at the beginning of the

564
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,290
class using mural into teams

565
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,450
they then know which team they're in and

566
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,040
when I say go into your team's if you

567
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,980
know you're in team one you go off to

568
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,590
the team one at call now you'll notice

569
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,360
that this team one call is just on hold

570
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,730
it's just been sitting there there's

571
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,790
nobody in it it's not going to stop

572
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,100
until somebody kills the call which I go

573
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,650
kill the calls later I have left them

574
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,540
open and I come back in 24 hours and

575
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,360
they've been killed so I assume there's

576
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:45,940
some kind of time limit but I've never

577
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,240
hung about to figure out at what it is

578
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,150
and for that three pounds per user per

579
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:56,020
month for licensed users you get

580
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:59,380
unlimited teams you get the 5,000

581
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:03,730
members you can run a single call can

582
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,800
have up to 250 people in it and

583
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:09,130
depending on the type of license you've

584
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,650
got and I've got I don't know what

585
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,870
license you need and but I can run

586
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:18,280
something called a live event which can

587
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,290
support up to 40,000 attendees but I

588
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,170
think I I have I have a special I do

589
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:28,540
have I have something called an e3

590
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:31,510
license for for Microsoft which is an

591
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,000
enterprise 3 which I think is too

592
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,460
$800 per user per month I don't pay that

593
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,060
don't worry and I get it as part of

594
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:47,800
being an MVP so as I basically pay

595
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:57,960
nothing for it so it's awesome yeah each

596
00:30:47,800 --> 00:31:01,710
lesson shooter has basic six dollars six

597
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,710
six dollars and

598
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:33,470
well I've never I put it this way I I

599
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,190
just I just have the basic licensing

600
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,980
there's only two licensed users in my

601
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:48,610
whole account which is me and my wife

602
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:51,999
and I have four hundred guests in fact I

603
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,879
actually run this which is a community

604
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:57,710
portal for all of my students ex class I

605
00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:02,929
don't know how many people are in here

606
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:05,509
must be they go 239 in that one team so

607
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,639
that's all my previous students that

608
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:10,490
also can come in and chat and access

609
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,149
extra stuff so I just run that in here

610
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,590
as well it's not as slick as slack you

611
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:17,570
know you can just send out the invite

612
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,879
URL you can't do that with teams you

613
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,999
have to invite emails explicitly but I

614
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:25,519
found the people that have come in and

615
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:30,080
done the live virtual class and teams

616
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,990
are quite happy to use team you know to

617
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,840
continue to use teams to come in and

618
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,179
chat and leave messages and and and talk

619
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,789
about stuff so that that's been that's

620
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,950
been quite good I did want to point out

621
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:44,659
something I did there was something I

622
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,509
wanted to point out and let me see if I

623
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:50,869
can remember how to do it and if you're

624
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:56,049
somebody who does like something like

625
00:32:50,869 --> 00:33:00,080
and zoom right but you want the other

626
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:05,629
capabilities in here as well then I'm

627
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,610
pretty sure I saw there now it's not

628
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:12,950
there I have to go over here down to

629
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:15,679
apps and then I think I can go zoom and

630
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:21,859
I can let's see let's add this to the

631
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:25,880
team where's the face-to-face so I'm

632
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:30,590
going to set up a zoom bot in this

633
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,390
Tim so all you do is you like I think

634
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,150
there's a button here somewhere they go

635
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,760
there's a zoom button start a meeting

636
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,070
schedule a meeting in zoom so if I just

637
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,250
go start a meeting it allows me to sign

638
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,230
it

639
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,100
sign in to zoom and teams and then it

640
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:50,990
are where you go and I think if you type

641
00:33:45,100 --> 00:34:01,280
zoom oh I just hit space do I do at zoom

642
00:33:50,990 --> 00:34:04,220
oh there we go and then you would start

643
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,100
a zoom meeting safe an organization is

644
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,820
blocking zoom and their home team's

645
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:14,210
would zoom it in to be right will not

646
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,909
bypass an organization's block okay one

647
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,889
of the reasons I use teams yeah is that

648
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,230
I'm not happy with them security

649
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:27,460
therefore if I'm using teams I don't

650
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:29,990
have to worry about that but if and I

651
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,840
mean Jim might not be the best example

652
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:35,149
for that but I'm pretty sure

653
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:44,090
where's zooms under communications so

654
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:47,780
probably there's a I don't know I don't

655
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:50,649
know what what this fuse that's a

656
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:58,730
communication service there's WebEx

657
00:34:50,649 --> 00:35:01,370
integration zoom was in here

658
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,750
I mean there's there's a lot of the

659
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,980
other platforms that provide

660
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:10,160
communication channels are in here as

661
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,970
well so you could would be able to use

662
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,870
multiple channels if you wanted to use

663
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,000
multiple channels that's all I was

664
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:20,630
getting at with being able to add the

665
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,600
the zoom bot it basically just sits

666
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,530
there in ads builds calls behind the

667
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,950
scenes and now I'm I'm writing an app

668
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:34,520
that is the same idea that will let us I

669
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,800
want to be able to do things and

670
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,869
there's an API for calling for the

671
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,480
calling infrastructure so in theory you

672
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:43,430
could do a 1/2 for all or other

673
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,910
liberating structure and actually

674
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:49,310
implement as a thing that that for

675
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,260
example and ever you know you give

676
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,360
everybody a minute and then you call

677
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,640
what wouldn't be one to four all via to

678
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,030
400 wouldn't it you you call it to for

679
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,180
all commands and it will go and take all

680
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:05,780
of your students break them up into

681
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,910
pairs and call each student and put them

682
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,890
in with a pair and then you can join to

683
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,070
Carl's so there's all the api's are

684
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,780
there to do that it's just a case of me

685
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,910
figuring out what the code is to

686
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,440
actually do that which is a little bit

687
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,730
harder because I suck at going these

688
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,320
days but I've built some stuff around it

689
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,410
like I can log in and get a list of

690
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,360
teams and I can do I've done some stuff

691
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,190
already and but I'm just messing around

692
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,580
with the API is just now to figure out

693
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:37,070
what is possible Microsoft are building

694
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,980
breakout rooms for teams dynamic

695
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,510
breakout rooms like zoom I'm trying to

696
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,940
get a hold of the folks that are

697
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,650
building it to maybe get proof of

698
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,350
concept maybe get us into the beta

699
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,380
program or something but I'm just

700
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,109
they're not very responsive like other

701
00:36:51,380 --> 00:37:00,220
groups that I prefer but yeah they're

702
00:36:54,109 --> 00:37:02,270
not very responsive are there any

703
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:06,770
questions those are something I missed

704
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:10,100
Magdalena Lee Martin Tory to recycle the

705
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,830
channels and the teams so you set this

706
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:16,790
up once you have the general channel you

707
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:19,240
have team one team two and to recycle

708
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:23,240
this for a next class I'll just

709
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,520
so I I don't so if I go into my edit

710
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:33,200
team I actually create one for each

711
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:35,140
class and then I can f it so I don't use

712
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,380
this very often but if I go down here I

713
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:44,090
can actually go those are active teams

714
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:46,550
and I can actually go archive the team

715
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,290
which will make it read only but the

716
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,460
data is still there they use

717
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,630
can still access it if they want to

718
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,990
means you do you don't have you don't

719
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:01,010
actually have to you don't have to do

720
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:03,470
that and I at him while I've been

721
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:10,910
playing with the app stuff to trying get

722
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:13,130
it up and running and I do have I do

723
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:16,910
have some lovely PowerShell if anybody's

724
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:20,920
interested and which goes and I've

725
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:25,820
actually got groups for each of the

726
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:29,590
types of class that I use to secure a

727
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:32,750
bunch of assets like seeing that and

728
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,750
remember I showed you the the the this

729
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,910
professional scrum community group I

730
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,890
have our courseware folder and in the

731
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,690
files is gonna folder for each of the

732
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,170
classes and inside of that it's got the

733
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,330
courseware only students who took the

734
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:54,830
PSM class can see this folder it's

735
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:56,660
secured against the PSM group right so

736
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,280
when I I built you know you have to

737
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,570
build an excel of students anyway

738
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,980
because you got to import it in the

739
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,140
scrum that org and you got to do all

740
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:07,760
this all the other stuff we've got to do

741
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:11,200
and I just import that CSV into here I'm

742
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,540
and down here somewhere it goes and

743
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,540
invites the user creates it actually

744
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:20,420
creates the team creates a class called

745
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,840
friendly name and invites the user

746
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,880
creates the team sets up all of the

747
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,010
stuff adds them to the right groups and

748
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,300
I just run that against the powershell

749
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,240
and that builds everything for me and

750
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,700
then once that's run I can just that's

751
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,680
how all they got there before I change

752
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,250
the way I did it and then I just go in

753
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,930
and and I add the picture and make it

754
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,700
look I don't know if you can see the

755
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,530
pictures on yours I think I've had

756
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,230
problems with that some people can see

757
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,100
it some people can't um but that just

758
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:54,110
makes it a little bit more friendly and

759
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,240
I don't do that much customization I'm

760
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:59,480
at the moment I'm waiting till I've got

761
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,339
all that I can add all of these tabs

762
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,390
with code and

763
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:08,299
can I you can everything except the

764
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,450
tagging which is unfortunate everything

765
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:12,769
except the tagging has an API and

766
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,739
they're just not ready to release the

767
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:17,390
API for that yet but there's got to be

768
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,009
one behind the scenes I just can't call

769
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,509
it yet

770
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:23,239
so almost ever I'm gonna qualify

771
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:24,859
everything and I'm if I'm building a

772
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,170
website that allows me to set all of

773
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:29,569
this up I'd be happy to share it with

774
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,700
everybody the more people using it the

775
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:36,410
more bugs I find that's how I think

776
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:38,779
about it um but I find it for the

777
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:42,309
classes that I've run so today was the

778
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:47,799
first day of the fifth virtual class um

779
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:51,319
and I ran one with Russell in zoom uh

780
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:52,880
Friday Thursday Friday and after using

781
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,269
this for a bunch of class II zoom was

782
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,700
really painful for me really painful

783
00:40:55,269 --> 00:41:00,769
like lots of stuff just just is are much

784
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:03,200
easier in here and I think I think it's

785
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:05,269
the stuff that matters like this is more

786
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,329
complicated for me as a trainer to set

787
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:11,420
up once users are in and they can switch

788
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:15,229
between the rooms it's it's super

789
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:16,910
straightforward I mean the whole

790
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:18,410
thinking about the infrastructure like

791
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,269
you've got as your Active Directory and

792
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:23,809
you've been office 365 and then you get

793
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:27,319
count invitations that's all like your

794
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,200
brain explodes but at once it's a shame

795
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,969
cause it's a bit of a pain to set up and

796
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,339
make sure you've got all the bits set up

797
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:39,799
but once it's all ready create a team

798
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:42,079
start adding people and quite often and

799
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:44,059
even before I've built the excel sheet

800
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,160
and added people to the to the right

801
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:47,749
grips and stuff I'll just go up when

802
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:54,650
they register and go add their email

803
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:58,759
address and then almost almost this is

804
00:41:54,650 --> 00:42:00,469
my list of students and I can export

805
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:04,039
that I could I could have the PowerShell

806
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:05,509
connect to this and then use this as my

807
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,359
list of students to go do the other

808
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:08,869
stuff that I want to do and these

809
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,499
already

810
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:15,140
these will already have the the like the

811
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:19,609
while that says face to face

812
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:24,650
PSK Edinburgh and date and if I go edit

813
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:26,480
team that's why I'm using this code so I

814
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,239
already know it's a PSK I already know

815
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,910
the date so I can add students for life

816
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:33,470
students manage all of that

817
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:43,099
programmatically as well just makes it

818
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:43,940
easier you're very quiet by the way I

819
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:58,359
don't know if you can bring the

820
00:42:43,940 --> 00:43:01,009
microphone closer limit al-sabah

821
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:02,839
carbon moisture I have a question is it

822
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:04,789
possible because I have as you know I

823
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,819
have two Microsoft account one is for

824
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:10,400
Gmail and one is paid Microsoft account

825
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:13,940
on Microsoft and is it possible to

826
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,970
integrate Calendar from Gmail into the

827
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:20,059
on Microsoft account because I cannot

828
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,819
schedule and any friend using Microsoft

829
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:29,839
things because my calendar is a label

830
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:35,900
day so when I when I shared you're in

831
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:39,470
here mm-hmm an ad so yeah I see what

832
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,329
your problem is so if you're coming in

833
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,660
under a Microsoft account you're coming

834
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:46,309
in under the free setup I don't know

835
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,160
what restrictions there are with the

836
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:53,269
three set up but like I said it's it's

837
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,730
three pounds was that as about three

838
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:59,960
euros yeah here's our per month for a

839
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:03,980
basic license business license I'm not

840
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,710
sure which one even even the lowest

841
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,980
license I just Russell set heads up

842
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:14,140
yesterday and the lowest license with

843
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:18,049
that has teams is three three euros per

844
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:20,539
user per month and he said it up as a

845
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:24,380
month-to-month which i think is like a

846
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:27,230
dollar more to do month to month per

847
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,940
month but then you can cancel at any

848
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:32,150
time rather than just paying a years

849
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:35,180
description I've had my account firm for

850
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,670
many years so since the since they

851
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,940
existed which sometimes causes me other

852
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:45,829
problems but because you know baggage

853
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,480
baggage is always fun but yeah I don't

854
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:50,660
know what meditations there are for the

855
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,260
free accounts oh yeah okay that's might

856
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,150
be an issue

857
00:44:51,260 --> 00:45:01,670
yeah I will investigate it Thanks

858
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:04,430
no problem thank you and give us a sense

859
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:07,069
of so first of all do I understand that

860
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:11,300
you recreate the team life it's your

861
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:14,000
face let's see I can walk you through

862
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:18,050
the process super quick oh sure man so I

863
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,710
just join or create a team create a team

864
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,720
build from scratch private or public

865
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:25,460
actually doesn't matter in my context

866
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,859
but if your company is bigger you you

867
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,780
probably want private and then I just

868
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:31,880
give it a name and this is the this is

869
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,250
actually the trick this is this is the

870
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,670
trick the first name you put in is what

871
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:42,369
it uses everywhere for URLs and stuff so

872
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:46,970
I do class and let's do a PSM 2000 and

873
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:48,980
2005 18 yeah so the PSM in fact let's do

874
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,980
a PSN that starts in a couple of days

875
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:55,310
there we go so I just put that in there

876
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,619
hit create and it will create the team

877
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:59,750
it's gonna go build the backend it's

878
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:01,520
gonna set up everything for me and then

879
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,829
I can start adding people right away but

880
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,910
I usually skip that because the name of

881
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,859
the team is going to come in in the

882
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,410
email so I don't want to add people yet

883
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:11,660
because it doesn't have a friendly name

884
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:16,900
so then I just go edit the the team and

885
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:22,569
this would be ah let's do live virtual

886
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,569
PSM I don't know where is it in

887
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:39,330
20th May 20 2001 in barcelona okay that

888
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,270
okay there we go

889
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:44,640
you know crap sorry

890
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:49,800
yeah it's complicated but it's possible

891
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:56,790
it's fun yeah no it's no it's setup and

892
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:59,100
if I if I I'm trying to see if I can get

893
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,930
to something that will show you like

894
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,820
when you get a link to the team or you

895
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:06,210
get the email address for the team the

896
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:09,660
email address will be this at my tenant

897
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:12,060
calm so it's kept that as the core name

898
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,150
while having the friendly name for the

899
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,840
emails and stuff so then I just go in

900
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:22,830
and I should be able to click on here

901
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:29,520
just do that a branding partner skin the

902
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:34,680
dark well not that one yes sir just

903
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:38,250
stick that in there there we go then

904
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,560
then I've got my friendly set up I go

905
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:45,320
into the general tab and I go yeah get

906
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:47,550
rid of that wiki and then I maybe add

907
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,520
some web pages like I did in the other

908
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:58,470
one that just takes a few seconds see

909
00:47:50,520 --> 00:48:00,330
just website and yes yeah nope I don't

910
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,890
post channel cuz then you don't have to

911
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:06,210
have a little post in there then you've

912
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:09,380
got your website and then I just go

913
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:13,320
manage team and I start adding members

914
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,580
so if they exist already you can just

915
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:23,160
add them and they don't need an

916
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:26,610
invitation but if I did you obviously

917
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:30,090
doesn't exist I would then get to get to

918
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:33,540
invite them so now Magdalena would be

919
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:35,310
the only one who can see that team and I

920
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:40,100
don't know how quickly it refreshes it's

921
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:43,430
usually pretty quick yeah

922
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,530
immediately so because she's already a

923
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:48,800
member and already in there as soon as

924
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:52,490
you pop it in she can she can see it and

925
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,430
you can set up I mean that that's pretty

926
00:48:52,490 --> 00:49:00,350
much all I do and then because this is

927
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:02,690
no team I can go to my calendar and I

928
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,850
actually do a jewel a new meeting and

929
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:09,140
there's a little clever thing here that

930
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:12,230
I can go into see this ad channel I'm I

931
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:16,450
can go to my live virtual PSM in

932
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:21,230
Barcelona general and I would call it I

933
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:23,330
would use the same words and if I and

934
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:26,420
then you saw there the content that I

935
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:28,880
put in the invitation I effectively put

936
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,040
that in here you know go and do these

937
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,510
things going to install teams but

938
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,180
everybody who I add to the team who then

939
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,340
accepts the invite will automatically

940
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,810
get paint as soon as they accept the

941
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,310
invite they'll get pending the calendar

942
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:47,990
invitation to the class after it's

943
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:51,680
automatic if you're if you're a member

944
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:56,780
of the team you will get the calendar

945
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:59,900
invite I don't know how often it polls

946
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,750
but it seems to just all do it all

947
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,180
automatically and then every time you

948
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,190
open up the calendar invite it goes and

949
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,140
updates the calendar invite and adds all

950
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,060
of the people who've accepted in and it

951
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:16,310
does lots of cool stuff for you which

952
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:20,560
it's nice it's nice not perfect but it's

953
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:23,060
got some nice features that's very cool

954
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,650
and what about the group's you were

955
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:30,310
mentioning that you were setting up

956
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:34,970
that's open show you that well let's go

957
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:38,990
and I just say send that out hmm

958
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:40,880
what was your the group yes only yeah

959
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:44,890
you mentioned that you had groups in

960
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,950
Active Directory ins and all that yes so

961
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,940
have you ever have you ever used have

962
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,620
you ever used

963
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,890
I might been joined to a Microsoft

964
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,930
domain

965
00:50:53,890 --> 00:51:00,410
well yes I'm just in the process of

966
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:03,530
doing it so registering all this had me

967
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,980
created the domain etc I've been about

968
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:09,890
this you just go you just go add groups

969
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:13,460
and in fact I don't know if you you can

970
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:16,819
you can hopefully see that but there's

971
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:19,670
actually a group for this class created

972
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:22,280
already okay all the members will be

973
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:24,740
automatically assigned into that group

974
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,480
and you can see that it's a current

975
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,099
currently got an outlet link and a

976
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,799
SharePoint Lync and the teams one will

977
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:32,930
pop in there in a little bit and it just

978
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,210
takes it goes and sets up stuff behind

979
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,900
the scenes there's the email address

980
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:40,849
that was created for it and then if you

981
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,390
remember in my parish shell I used our

982
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:47,270
gooood and to reference it that's that

983
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,119
so you can get all of the date out of

984
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,059
the places you need and then oh there's

985
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:53,869
a new groups experience whoo oh it

986
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:57,049
doesn't change that much

987
00:51:53,869 --> 00:52:02,210
oh I was hoping for awesome coolness but

988
00:51:57,049 --> 00:52:05,299
I just got me the openness so you have

989
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:08,270
all of the the grips set up there and if

990
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:10,190
I go back to the root and I don't know

991
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:13,309
if anybody saw but when you go to login

992
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:17,030
and in emails you have my logo and

993
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:19,369
various things quite often if you try to

994
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:21,470
login to my domain it will pop up

995
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:23,780
we need the login box we'll have my logo

996
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:26,839
at the top and you've literally just got

997
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,609
company branding and you go set up

998
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:34,730
company branding and you can do multiple

999
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:37,849
languages if you want as well so all

1000
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:41,390
those groups created while using team so

1001
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:45,380
is it your your scripts that creates

1002
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:47,569
also automatic okay

1003
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,460
it's just when I created but I just you

1004
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:52,549
saw I didn't run any scripts true true

1005
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:59,950
the parser 101 and if I go look at

1006
00:52:52,549 --> 00:53:04,869
members oh wait hmm cool thanks yeah

1007
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:08,440
I don't know what else to show you guys

1008
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:10,630
yeah well it's just a question how are

1009
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,970
the students reacting with all the

1010
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:15,250
emails they receive they are lost you

1011
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:19,540
have to guide them a lot how do you

1012
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:22,240
handle that no no in the clinic for

1013
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,579
students in the classes I've run I

1014
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,109
haven't had any issues whatsoever okay

1015
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:30,250
nobody's questioned anything nobody's

1016
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:33,460
said they've got a problem with anything

1017
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:36,760
they're just quite happy to to come in

1018
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:40,000
and join there was one um team member of

1019
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,859
my last class that said that and I think

1020
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,540
he doesn't have install rights on his

1021
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:45,430
local machine okay

1022
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,930
so we couldn't install teams and it

1023
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,270
wasn't there but he used the web-based

1024
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:52,960
version for the class and it worked fine

1025
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:55,599
for him okay because they need that they

1026
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,150
need the rides to install at least the

1027
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,440
client you want to install the client

1028
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,109
you're gonna need rights to install it

1029
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:08,890
if you but you can use the web-based

1030
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:16,540
version if you just go to teams X off

1031
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:20,140
comm exactly the same yeah and they have

1032
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,369
the same the same features and they they

1033
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,700
can run it from here

1034
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:27,430
so I admit I've never actually used the

1035
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:29,530
web version but it looks like it's

1036
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:33,460
pretty much identical you've got all of

1037
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:35,290
the different things pretty

1038
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:37,569
straightforward for me for me and

1039
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,180
because I've set mine up over a long

1040
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:42,550
period of time it's it's pretty

1041
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:47,079
straightforward once you get there okay

1042
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:50,319
and then you don't have any for example

1043
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:53,050
I've been working with a client and they

1044
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:58,450
denied to use zoom directly maybe they

1045
00:54:53,050 --> 00:55:01,740
said here iterations to meet so but with

1046
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:04,359
this if if I told to an organization and

1047
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:07,119
they are not related with teams and they

1048
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:09,300
have to install teams what do I have to

1049
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,369
say to them

1050
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,510
so to convince them that it's more

1051
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:16,570
secure than zoom

1052
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:24,630
the eye I have I have never encountered

1053
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:28,480
any customer okay Witten office365 backs

1054
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:31,780
almost every large fortune 500

1055
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:37,330
organization in the world I mean it's

1056
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:39,520
it's it is the tool that office365 is

1057
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,540
the tool that most big enterprises use

1058
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,430
I'm not saying that there's no

1059
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:46,390
enterprises on other stuff there there

1060
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:51,640
are for sure but if you if Google's not

1061
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:54,460
on it but for for most big organizations

1062
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,550
that this is what they use as their

1063
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:00,910
communication platform now what you

1064
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:03,790
might find is that an organization might

1065
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:07,900
not give people install rights they can

1066
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:12,760
use the web access an organization and I

1067
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:18,430
do have one customer so in Active

1068
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:22,780
Directory the default is that it allows

1069
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:25,450
my employees so members of my Active

1070
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:28,630
Directory to become guests in somebody

1071
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:32,170
else's Active Directory but that can be

1072
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:35,310
locked down because again it provides

1073
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:39,930
the security that enterprise's asked for

1074
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:43,660
so I do have one customer that cannot

1075
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:45,700
use their corporate email to log into

1076
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:49,119
teams even though they have teams in the

1077
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,920
office because their corporation denies

1078
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,960
it you know have you ever been on site

1079
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,660
with a customer and they they've got

1080
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,780
that login federated ping pong thing

1081
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:01,720
goes on yes it's long and it pawns over

1082
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,180
to their federated and them back if a

1083
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:08,500
corporate user with that system logs

1084
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:10,240
into my teams they go through the same

1085
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,660
authentication for their corporate

1086
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,390
identity so their corporation can deny

1087
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,280
it that is possible but then they can

1088
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,640
just login with a Microsoft account it's

1089
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:24,040
fine like an MSE that's the Azure Active

1090
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:28,310
Directory that's the corporate accounts

1091
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,600
or Microsoft account MSA

1092
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:32,760
that's the same when you log into Xbox

1093
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,920
that's just the free one like Magdalena

1094
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:40,050
was saying she came in on it's just a

1095
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:43,200
free one mark I know buddy that wanted

1096
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:45,540
access that couldn't get access okay

1097
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:53,730
Martin how do I see which license I have

1098
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:55,260

expecting all right you should be able

1105
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:21,690
to click on now I'm guessing here so I'm

1106
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:24,770
just gonna click it and see so I've gone

1107
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:27,090
into my account if you end up here

1108
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:31,380
you're you're using a corporate

1109
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:41,330
credential if you end up on account stop

1110
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:47,550
Microsoft calm which is you end up Oh

1111
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:51,830
sign in yeah that's how I love you yeah

1112
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:54,980
this is the non corporate we end Oh

1113
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,980
where's my

1114
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:11,340
to factor and fingerprint if you end up

1115
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:14,400
here

1116
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,320
that's a Microsoft account yeah so I've

1117
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,780
got my Martina and she would calm

1118
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,000
enabled as a Microsoft account and then

1119
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,610
you go into I don't know payments and

1120
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,400
billing I think in here or maybe service

1121
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,060
and subscriptions actually and it should

1122
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,130
list

1123
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:32,970
what subscriptions you have but I'm not

1124
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:34,500
sure that any sort of personal page for

1125
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:38,100
account will give you the features that

1126
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:41,940
you want okay because I have a Microsoft

1127
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:45,870
365 family oh I probably needs to make

1128
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:49,290
my credit card but um that that's the

1129
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:51,870
the but that gives me the office tools

1130
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:54,600
but it does not give me teams I'd be

1131
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:57,590
using teams for free if I logged in

1132
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:00,210
under this personal subscription however

1133
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:03,420
this is my corporate my corporate

1134
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:05,340
subscription yeah which I set up so it's

1135
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:09,050
not I don't work for a bigger company

1136
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:11,940
it's just me yeah like like you guys and

1137
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,710
then if you get to this page you click

1138
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,870
on subscriptions on the left and you can

1139
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,400
see what subscriptions you've got so

1140
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:20,070
this is the one that I pay for for me

1141
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,650
which is business standard which

1142
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,120
includes should be teams on here

1143
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,520
somewhere I think it you just get it

1144
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,470
almost often but things being killed

1145
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:34,560
awesome that's a good idea because it

1146
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:36,930
sucks um but I also have our III assign

1147
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:41,700
to me developer account which gives me

1148
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:45,140
more stuff but that's where you'll see

1149
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:49,140
what subscriptions you've got and and

1150
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:52,920
you can you can set up and as your

1151
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:55,620
Active Directory accounts set set aside

1152
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,120
some time to go through all of if you're

1153
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:00,210
going to set it up for yourself so

1154
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,780
you've got that capability you're going

1155
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:05,970
to need to set aside some time to invest

1156
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,340
and maybe reading some of the docs and

1157
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:11,069
figuring out if you just walk through

1158
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,509
the process and it does they

1159
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:13,709
do a pretty good job of leading you

1160
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:16,829
through the process I hope Russell

1161
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:18,930
through it yesterday but there's

1162
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:21,479
definitely some bits where even I was

1163
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,949
like oh how do I do that and I had to

1164
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:25,440
look up the docks because I did it

1165
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:27,209
organically over time everything's

1166
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,619
really well documented on the Microsoft

1167
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:30,449
site and sometimes you have to just have

1168
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,499
to follow the five-step process to solve

1169
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:37,709
a particular problem like by default

1170
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:41,789
guests can't join your teams you have to

1171
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:45,749
go say explicitly yes I want to allow

1172
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:48,930
guests to access my team's there's just

1173
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:50,579
a five-step web page that says go do all

1174
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:55,859
of these things in this order and then

1175
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:59,029
you're done so if anybody wants help

1176
01:01:55,859 --> 01:02:00,900
with that process I'm quite happy to

1177
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:03,630
help them and point them in the right

1178
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:06,660
direction and what you set up but you

1179
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:12,719
ultimately if you just go to I think if

1180
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:16,499
you just go to Microsoft comm forward

1181
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:21,779
slash office I think and then you see

1182
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:24,690
for business rather than for home you

1183
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:27,569
can get office a Microsoft they've

1184
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:30,269
changed that Microsoft 365 basic and

1185
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:31,920
that includes teams you know I suppose I

1186
01:02:30,269 --> 01:02:34,380
have this plan because I have paid

1187
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,599
Microsoft for my company for invoices

1188
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:41,430
and everything but I need to check the

1189
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:43,229
base legal standard mm-hmm if standard

1190
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:48,140
just did only definitely basic and

1191
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:48,140
standard as you get the apps yeah yeah

1192
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:55,559
so some more applications than getting

1193
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:58,190
basic yeah and they have they have a big

1194
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:01,079
list of here's all the crap you get and

1195
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:05,549
if you just hit by now it'll lead you

1196
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:08,579
through the process to create an add a

1197
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:10,650
subscription and I can either add it to

1198
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:12,479
my existing account which would be the

1199
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:15,150
one I already have our sign up for a new

1200
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:16,349
account in which case if I hit sign up

1201
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,690
for a new it's gonna save me out see

1202
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:21,420
there's my local coming in and my

1203
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:24,089
background e thing you can do all of

1204
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,410
those nice brandy stuff and then it's

1205
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:32,910
gonna ask me

1206
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:32,910
what what am i setting up so if I do a

1207
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:39,940
that's probably gonna say that doesn't

1208
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,249
exist create a new account and then I

1209
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:55,989
could go through the process of setting

1210
01:03:42,249 --> 01:04:00,729
that up does that make sense yeah not a

1211
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:03,220
question you've invited me with my gmail

1212
01:04:00,729 --> 01:04:07,299
address but I think I was in it with the

1213
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:10,509
other address I can't remember okay when

1214
01:04:07,299 --> 01:04:13,479
I switched my to my gmail address now to

1215
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:19,650
the the toolings I have are they

1216
01:04:13,479 --> 01:04:24,460
registered to my other account now or

1217
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:28,630
how would that work so when I when I

1218
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:32,999
invite you you have to use the email

1219
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:37,119
that I invited if that email is a

1220
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:38,650
corporate account already it will let

1221
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,019
you it will take you to your corporate

1222
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:43,269
account login and then create your

1223
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:45,099
account in my Azure Active Directory

1224
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:46,599
based on your corporate account so you

1225
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:51,460
only ever use your corporate credentials

1226
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:53,950
if your email address has already been

1227
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:57,400
enabled as I'm msai a Microsoft account

1228
01:04:53,950 --> 01:05:00,729
so for example you use it to sign in to

1229
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,619
your Xbox already yeah so if you sign in

1230
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:05,920
to your Xbox with your your gmail

1231
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:09,180
account it will just again ask you for

1232
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:13,210
your existing credentials and then

1233
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:16,989
you'll log straight in if that email

1234
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:20,349
address has never been used on any

1235
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:23,079
Microsoft service then it will say you

1236
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:25,569
need to set this up you need to enable

1237
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:28,450
this as a Microsoft account and it'll

1238
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:31,029
ask you for a password you put in the

1239
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:33,279
the you pick a passwords and then that

1240
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:35,019
is now a Microsoft account and you can

1241
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:38,740
use that same email address and password

1242
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:42,160
to log into my services go over to X

1243
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:44,170
barks calm and login there go over to I

1244
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,790
don't know any other thing that accepts

1245
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:49,270
Microsoft accounts and use it there as

1246
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:50,830
well does that make sense so is that

1247
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:54,790
there's actually only three things that

1248
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:57,730
can happen and the old result in the

1249
01:05:54,790 --> 01:06:03,190
same thing which you have an entry on my

1250
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:05,650
account and you saw that a well I've got

1251
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:08,290
rid of it now but your when it says I

1252
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:11,890
can't type when I brought up yours Peter

1253
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:13,720
it said a Microsoft because it's a gmail

1254
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:19,119
account so it can only be a Microsoft

1255
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:20,440
account but for example and if I don't

1256
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,440
want to go look it up cuz you'll see

1257
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,940
everybody's data and but if I look up

1258
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,550
somebody who's used their corporate

1259
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,560
credentials it will just say external as

1260
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,619
your Active Directory because it's

1261
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,860
already an external account so I'm not

1262
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:37,540
taking anything from if a corporation

1263
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:40,300
already has an existing policy

1264
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,550
I'm not overriding that they're using

1265
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,890
their credentials in my service so I

1266
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:46,630
don't have their password I don't reset

1267
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,960
their password their company controls

1268
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,280
that I don't do anything that's where

1269
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,130
you can run into the problem that they

1270
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,810
blocked it deliberately but it's open by

1271
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:58,000
default so they have to have gone and

1272
01:06:55,810 --> 01:07:00,460
done it deliberately likes when you get

1273
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,369
IT departments run by nasties that's

1274
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:06,040
when that happens it's actually our

1275
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:08,230
government it's the the the Department

1276
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:12,540
of Work and Pensions in the UK that's my

1277
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:15,760
only customer that's that has that block

1278
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:19,290
and I've worked with defense companies

1279
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,290
as well and they don't have that blocked

1280
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,590
any other questions that have to do that

1281
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:28,420
or I mean obviously if you were going to

1282
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:29,710
set it up you'd probably end up in a

1283
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,270
place where you went how the hell do I

1284
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:34,210
do that thing Martin showed me and I'm

1285
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:41,130
quite happy to to help with that when

1286
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:44,859
you get there uh there is um I believe

1287
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:47,650
that Microsoft are somebody at Microsoft

1288
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:49,780
through Steve Porter offered everybody

1289
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:51,920
six months all the trainer six months

1290
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,769
for free

1291
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,710
does anybody remember that I remember

1292
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:59,930
that strong yeah so the the I don't know

1293
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:01,339
I don't know how you claim that but if

1294
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:03,740
you find I think it was a neat was an

1295
01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:04,910
email on the channel I think it was an

1296
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,609
email in the channel because they were

1297
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:09,829
external maybe but they worked for

1298
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:11,779
Microsoft and they they've organized for

1299
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:15,079
all of the trainers to get six months

1300
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:17,750
for free I don't know if it's still

1301
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:19,370
captured in that in the document I Steve

1302
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,580
put together for the live virtual

1303
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:25,130
classes I think it was recorded there ok

1304
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,600
cool I think it's just embarrassing you

1305
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,880
email and they're gonna give you a code

1306
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,159
and you've somewhere in here it'll ask

1307
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,179
me for money and at that point I can put

1308
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:38,150
in that code instead of money you might

1309
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:39,830
stay in a credit card cuz they're gonna

1310
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,480
want their money after the six months a

1311
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:45,049
bit like it's three dollars per user per

1312
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,549
month it's not like his what what zoom

1313
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:49,069
zoom

1314
01:08:46,549 --> 01:08:51,469
twelve pounds per user per month

1315
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:56,210
something like that 15 days yes it's

1316
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:58,549
like $150 for you yeah so yeah but but

1317
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:02,150
think think about what you get with this

1318
01:08:58,549 --> 01:09:03,620
all the the the act I mean maybe if you

1319
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:05,630
don't care about the extra services I

1320
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:07,219
guess it doesn't matter but you get your

1321
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:09,710
corporate email on your corporate domain

1322
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:12,049
you get a terabyte of cloud storage to

1323
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,509
put all of your stuff and if you pay the

1324
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:17,060
it's less than the price of zoom the

1325
01:09:14,509 --> 01:09:19,909
name the ten you pounds per user per

1326
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,310
month you get all of the office apps you

1327
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:24,920
get five licenses for all of them for

1328
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:27,830
your tablets for everything you get

1329
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:31,040
SharePoint you get not that everybody

1330
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:33,589
likes SharePoint but the new don't paint

1331
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,779
the new version of SharePoint sharepoint

1332
01:09:33,589 --> 01:09:38,060
online the modern sharepoint with the

1333
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:40,759
old sharepoint stuff the old sharepoint

1334
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:42,589
sucked it was a horrible platform i had

1335
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:46,339
to use it and support it and maintain it

1336
01:09:42,589 --> 01:09:49,819
with microsoft taking the pain of that

1337
01:09:46,339 --> 01:09:55,280
away it runs really well and has some

1338
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:57,530
good features that are useful yeah and

1339
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,570
and over the weekend i i i just

1340
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,090
subscribed for the microsoft business

1341
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:04,400
basic any is the first six months of

1342
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,260
three I didn't go through stronger org

1343
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,600
okay

1344
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:12,170
so if you think you have to take a year

1345
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:13,490
early early subscription but the first

1346
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:16,370
six months you got a Half Price

1347
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:20,110
effectively exactly yeah

1348
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:22,490
and that half price is pint fifty per

1349
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:26,780
user per month and you only need to buy

1350
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:28,970
one user well they're still that limit

1351
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,140
of five so I'm guessing because you

1352
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,830
don't have the basic you have two

1353
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,020
standard

1354
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:36,320
I guess they they remove the limit for

1355
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,850
the standard but for my account when I

1356
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,760
was reading through the documentation

1357
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:44,960
there was that limit of five invited

1358
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,710
guests have you guys tried it I'm not

1359
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,300
there yet

1360
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,980
I didn't when you find you get there

1361
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:51,470
maybe you could invite all of us and

1362
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:54,830
then we could we could see if we can

1363
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:57,530
break the five limit hmm

1364
01:10:54,830 --> 01:11:01,430
yeah that would be that would be a good

1365
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:05,030
way to test it because I there's so

1366
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:09,530
there's a secret there's lots of things

1367
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:12,080
that um we meet you buy a license for

1368
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:14,120
but if you buy the license for one month

1369
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:18,980
and turn it off it doesn't disable the

1370
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:22,640
stuff so like I I used the Active

1371
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:25,370
Directory advanced set up I can't

1372
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,370
remember why I wanted it but I in I

1373
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:30,650
turned it on I enabled a bunch of stuff

1374
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:32,810
I decided it wasn't worth the money I

1375
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:36,560
turned it off but I still have all the

1376
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:39,140
stuff that I turned on when I had it I

1377
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,820
just the page just now says all you have

1378
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:45,740
to buy it to use it and like it's all

1379
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:47,570
configured now I don't care there's a

1380
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:51,830
bunch of branding stuff and other things

1381
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:56,330
and stuff to set up so yeah I I'm not

1382
01:11:51,830 --> 01:12:00,470
sure which of the the licenses gives you

1383
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:01,670
more team's access and so you can add

1384
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:04,190
more guests

1385
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:07,910
I would like to find the page that

1386
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:13,010
understands that so that so that we can

1387
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:14,750
see but b2b is one of the features of

1388
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:17,000
Azure Active Directory that's business

1389
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:19,250
to business accounts which is what we've

1390
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,790
been using here and because ultimately

1391
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,490
it's

1392
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:24,080
so that you know that thing where you go

1393
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:25,760
to a customer site and they give you

1394
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,500
logon credentials and you're like I'll

1395
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,170
crap another thing I've got to remember

1396
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,490
and this is designed to replace that

1397
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:33,350
system so you just use your own

1398
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:36,500
corporate credentials and can log into

1399
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:39,170
as many customers as you want or as let

1400
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,780
you that's how come I can switch over to

1401
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:43,820
the Microsoft tenant here as well

1402
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:48,920
they've added my account as a guest in

1403
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:53,240
their tenant if there's no other

1404
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:54,380
questions we're a little bit over but it

1405
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,080
seems like you were having fun and

1406
01:12:54,380 --> 01:13:03,680
nobody wanted to leave so I kept talking

1407
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:05,180
and I did that it's complicated question

1408
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,520
it's complicated to set up your own

1409
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:13,520
domain in this tenant and all this stuff

1410
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:17,330
so know once so once you once you've got

1411
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:20,450
it and once you've created the account

1412
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:23,290
that thing I was following through one

1413
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:27,170
of the steps was set up your business

1414
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:30,620
yeah when you set it up you'll have your

1415
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:35,210
business name dot on microsoft.com

1416
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:39,560
as your email address ok and then you

1417
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:43,820
literally just open up by gwyn out of

1418
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:48,110
directory and click on custom domain

1419
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:50,870
names so there's my my default one which

1420
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:51,710
has my old company domain name then you

1421
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:57,140
just click Add

1422
01:13:51,710 --> 01:14:04,520
what's your domain put for example agile

1423
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:08,630
six one one calm six one there we go and

1424
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:12,020
then it then you have okay then it will

1425
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:16,090
give me the text and MX records to

1426
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:20,630
validate it and set up all of the emails

1427
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:23,540
and you don't have any limit abusers

1428
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:26,350
when you add students is aghast in here

1429
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:31,250
for your bed actory or is this just you

1430
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:32,900
here no I mean I just I oh I probably

1431
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:37,520
did want to go in there

1432
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:41,510
ah no I have let me put this on the

1433
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:43,880
other screen so I can lick oh yes so I

1434
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,530
just sent so I just sent the link where

1435
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:49,130
they say there's a limit up to the

1436
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:52,880
number of invited yes where did you send

1437
01:14:49,130 --> 01:15:02,090
it in the chat the Chad b2b licensing

1438
01:14:52,880 --> 01:15:16,130
guidance let's see we should go down

1439
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:20,630
just a bit 60 gets users yes Microsoft

1440
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:24,050
account yeah well it says it's right

1441
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:26,650
there what that does it actually doesn't

1442
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,650
make any sense

1443
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:35,460
so I haven't tried to break the limit so

1444
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:38,730
I have two licensees on my account

1445
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:47,670
yes and I have like 500 guests guests

1446
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:52,370
okay yes that's enough yeah and you can

1447
01:15:47,670 --> 01:16:10,410
always I think you can make it unlimited

1448
01:15:52,370 --> 01:16:13,500
by by buying this yes so that's that you

1449
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:14,430
have been 203 so that's why you don't

1450
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,800
have a limit

1451
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:20,390
yeah I have it Ivan III as well all

1452
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,520
right

1453
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:31,140
but even if I I'm the thousand it's a

1454
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:35,910
lot yeah but even if you just like you

1455
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:38,790
can buy a premium p1 and a premium p1

1456
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:50,550
would be $6 if you have one user in your

1457
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:54,470
account and a p1 but that's where it got

1458
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:55,830
confused I got confused was that

1459
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:58,740
office365

1460
01:16:55,830 --> 01:17:04,050
no so this is separate uh-huh they gives

1461
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:07,410
you extra features so here let me let me

1462
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:09,420
trying to F because they really like the

1463
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:17,610
color the company branding and all this

1464
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:20,090
stuff so there another one guest

1465
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:20,090
features

1466
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,319
[Applause]

1467
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:42,760
so for each paid when you're ten you can

1468
01:17:40,059 --> 01:17:50,110
invite up to five users for additional

1469
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:55,449
guests beyond the fifth one I don't pay

1470
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:58,570
anything but you're an MVP I know but

1471
01:17:55,449 --> 01:17:59,800
it's it's I'm gonna have to go now I'm

1472
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:07,030
good I have to go edit the video and

1473
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:10,869
delete that [Â __Â ] anyway um I know but I

1474
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:12,699
and this doesn't know I am an MVP okay

1475
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:17,889
does that make sense

1476
01:18:12,699 --> 01:18:19,239
this is just don't even know where it go

1477
01:18:17,889 --> 01:18:22,800
to find out how much I mean for that

1478
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:22,800
usage until 8 X 3

1479
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:40,449
nope this one this one this one nope I

1480
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:45,730
click the bad button yes this asleep

1481
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:48,550
shins is what you already said well so I

1482
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:52,540
but I do so I do pay for other stuff on

1483
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:55,120
here ok because if you want to spin up I

1484
01:18:52,540 --> 01:19:01,030
can spin up a server on here and I paid

1485
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:08,860
for the server I'm trying to find how I

1486
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:12,760
I bet you go here and billing there a

1487
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:26,679
billing thing ill cost management and

1488
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:31,480
billing and you can create badges cost

1489
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:32,920
analysis it's not easy to figure out how

1490
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:38,440
much you pay for stuff on here by the

1491
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:44,230
way still loading

1492
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:47,139
oh well that's nothing so 30 pounds

1493
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:52,540
that'd be bound for that using the

1494
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:56,610
beyond so that's for some tools that I

1495
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:59,610
run let's try the other one did you go

1496
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,610
select

1497
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:09,670
No Oh it's loading I'm just too

1498
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:11,590
impatient I'm used to the old world that

1499
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:16,989
it just takes it just yeah I don't think

1500
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:20,230
I pay anything on here so that that's

1501
01:20:16,989 --> 01:20:28,060
the only billing I've got which is not

1502
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:30,730
for any of these your stuff so forecast

1503
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:34,210
is about fifty fifty pounds uh a month

1504
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:36,820
and that's for some server stuff that I

1505
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:38,410
run I can actually probably delete that

1506
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:41,590
server okay good idea

1507
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:45,660
I run some DNS I have added my DNS in

1508
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:51,580
here as well here okay so it cost me

1509
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:58,630
very cheap there's my wife's DNS for her

1510
01:20:51,580 --> 01:21:00,790
server twenty twenty-one pence so I bet

1511
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:05,410
where would I go to find out the other

1512
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:06,970
stuff so if I go to account so then

1513
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,620
that's that's the stuff that my company

1514
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:11,110
pays for mm-hmm

1515
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:13,120
this is the stuff that I pay for like

1516
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:18,670
kind of as an individual it goes through

1517
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:20,290
the company cards and know I'm in the

1518
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:25,239
wrong place now that's just my account

1519
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:30,460
where how do I get to the where was i

1520
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:34,980
before that's the only thing office

1521
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:39,030
that's where we were before and then in

1522
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:49,960
my account so now we might offer stock

1523
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:57,250
and subscriptions yeah but I bought it a

1524
01:21:49,960 --> 01:22:00,040
barrel it doesn't have if you notice it

1525
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:02,560
doesn't have teams in there no it it's

1526
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:06,880
further down though I know I have teams

1527
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:11,080
as part of this I also have other stuff

1528
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:14,440
that's part of the e3 the e3 has a

1529
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:18,520
minute but and I also have this

1530
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:21,610
if you want yeah so that one was the six

1531
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,370
dollars per user yeah yeah additional

1532
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:27,340
six dollars per user so I pay for two so

1533
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:29,710
additional twelve dollars and I get the

1534
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,350
the extra I get the extra layer of

1535
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:34,450
security and all of my two-factor

1536
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:36,430
authentication and a bunch of other

1537
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:38,290
stuff that I use because if I've got

1538
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:41,770
everything on here I've got all of my

1539
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:45,220
student emails are in excel sheets

1540
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:47,110
secured on this system so it has to be

1541
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,360
has to be secure so I pay a little bit

1542
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:52,230
extra and for additional security

1543
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:59,130
I'm just looking for where I actually

1544
01:22:52,230 --> 01:23:01,930
pay money for this I'm good to know I

1545
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:04,390
know it comes to my credit card put it

1546
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:05,800
this way I checked my credit cards I

1547
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:09,100
don't have anything come out that I'm

1548
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:12,670
like holy crap look at that and maybe

1549
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:15,790
pay a hundred bucks a year for office

1550
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:19,090
365 and maybe fifty bucks a month for my

1551
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:20,530
user stuff and that gets I've got a

1552
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:23,950
bunch of servers and other stuff in

1553
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:26,920
there as well and that pricing was for

1554
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:28,900
the servers and DNS and that kind of

1555
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,490
thing so it's maybe I pay a hundred

1556
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:33,400
bucks maybe I paid two hundred bucks a

1557
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:36,910
year for office 365 stuff and that gets

1558
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:41,020
me everything hmm so what if I wanted to

1559
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:44,280
get the issue p1 because I'm already

1560
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:46,930
invested I have to make that work for my

1561
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:49,360
you just you just don't put you open up

1562
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:53,280
an active directory on any of the things

1563
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:56,320
like if you went to nope

1564
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:58,500

there

1566
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:04,039
I don't know so to be honest I would

1567
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:05,210
google it and then I would figure out

1568
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,840
from there that's what I normally do

1569
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:17,480
okay but there's definitely I think

1570
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:23,059
that's a premium feature yeah I'll look

1571
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:25,699
out how I get I can get general

1572
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:27,380
collaboration properties maybe no I

1573
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:29,449
actually don't I don't know where you go

1574
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:34,969
for that stuff to be on yeah I'll figure

1575
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:35,809
it out thanks thanks that's very

1576
