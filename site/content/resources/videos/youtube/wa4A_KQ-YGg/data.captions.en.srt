1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,679
so the question was what are immersive

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,300
training courses

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,880
and I think that's a that's a great

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,359
question because there's been a lot of

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,180
Buzz around immersive training classes

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,779
what's the difference between

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,060
um

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,460
the different types of classes and I

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,680
think the the traditional class format

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,399
has always been the two full days

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,440
right and part of that is because if

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,399
you're a part of that is because if

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,100
you're going to get a whole bunch of

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,079
people together for a training class

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
um you want to in a small amount of time

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,480
as possible so that you're not paying

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,700
for hotels you're not paying for

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,020
um people traveling around however it is

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,300
you're getting those people into that

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,680
place plus if they're going to be out of

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,079
the office

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,940
for those days and they've got to travel

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,260
to the trading location you only want

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,280
them doing it twice you don't want them

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,940
doing it

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,240
four four half days right

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,799
um but with the virtual space I I moved

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,479
all of my classes to four half days

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,000
which was kind of a start of this

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,720
process and the advantage to four half

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,180
days initially was twofold one is you

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,040
can have uh people are only out half

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,600
days right so they could still get work

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,840
done in the afternoons or the mornings

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,560
however you're running it and but also I

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,259
tried uh introducing activities so more

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,479
of the flipped learning experience uh

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,520
first step towards

39
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,780
um the the immersive experience and in

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,100
the flipped learning of experience

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,500
people get small assignments to do

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,320
uh where they're they're Reading Writing

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,759
watching uh content so that kind of

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,040
interactive much more interactive

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,100
experience self-paced learning as well

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,619
as the The imperson Experience

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,840
um but the way

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,159
that's also not as good for the way

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,360
people learn

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,479
right

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,280
um it's better than to fill this

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,420
um flipped learning is better

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,480
but what's even better is if you as a

54
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,819
participant to a class are able to spend

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,580
some time learning something and then

56
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,099
able to go try and implement it

57
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,599
in your real world

58
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,340
and then come back around and share that

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,260
experience with other people who have

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,140
tried the same thing in their companies

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,860
or in the same company right

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,739
um and then learn some more stuff

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,900
and then go try that new stuff in your

64
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,000
organization in your company

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,239
so the immersive learning experience

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,220
instead of being at four half days so 16

67
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,819
hours what I've been doing is is four

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,220
half days with probably about two hours

69
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,099
of additional possible material

70
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,780
right uh each day

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:04,140
um is moving it to eight half days over

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,080
eight weeks so you do one session a week

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,000
and at the end of that session

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,040
um the the participants are given an

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,280
assignment to do in their organization

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,599
so we're starting with the product owner

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,080
class so they're maybe given an

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,760
assignment to try and

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,260
um and do something a little bit

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
differently figure out maybe try and

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,879
figure out what is value to your

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,200
organization right

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,000
um and that might be that might be the

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,860
first one that might even be one of the

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,780
assignments right so go to figure out

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,659
that in your company so then when we

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,420
come back we probably spend the first

88
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,040
part of the next session talking about

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,019
what did they discover what did they

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,720
discover the the their organization

91
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,580
values how

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,799
um does that change the way they think

93
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,260
about the product and what it is they're

94
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,060
creating did they find that that maybe

95
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,680
their company doesn't understand what

96
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,480
value is and they had to come up with

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,879
something brand new to figure out what

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,620
value is and then how do you test that

99
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,900
within your organization so all those

100
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,840
kind of questions and discussions

101
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,140
and I think the the there's there's two

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,180
huge that different but both equally

103
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,340
great value propositions between a

104
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,979
private class and a public class right

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,260
because in a private class everybody in

106
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,000
the room is from the same company

107
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,120
so they can share the same dirty laundry

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,759
right and perhaps

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,740
um have have have conversations about oh

110
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,300
but I tried this with these people I'm

111
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,979
working with and that worked great and

112
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,720
then they can maybe a little bit more

113
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,100
sharing right so that's that's a good

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,380
value proposition

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,740
but I think the public value proposition

116
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,320
is also good as well right you've got

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
12 people in the class each of the 12

118
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,160
people have gone off into their own

119
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,660
company and tried their own thing and

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,340
then they're bringing back these very

121
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,440
different experiences because it's

122
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,940
different companies

123
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,680
um and then sharing them with each other

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,300
and what could we do differently and oh

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,100
yeah I've got somebody in my company

126
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,020
who's just like that person and yours

127
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,720
perhaps we could work together to figure

128
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,360
out how we how we do that

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,880
so that that

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,639
is like the progression of the flipped

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,160
learning that you don't just have some

132
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,199
um activities that are offline learning

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,639
like self-paced online stuff I'm gonna

134
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,100
read some stuff I'm gonna watch some

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,280
videos but I'm actually I've actually

136
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,560
got a production assignment I'm going to

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,139
go into my organization

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,759
try to do something in a particular way

139
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,680
that's to do with the things that we've

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,979
been talking about in the class and then

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,860
come back and pull it all together with

142
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,320
the other people in my class who have

143
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,940
been learning the same thing

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,300
that would be the immersive learning

145
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,300
experience

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,660
