**What are immersive training courses?**

Dive into the buzz around immersive training courses with me, Martin Hinshelwood! This form of Agile training is making waves, offering a dynamic and transformative learning experience.

Together, we'll explore traditional training formats, the evolution to four half days, the concept of flipped learning, and the power of immersive learning experiences.

Get ready to discover how this revolutionary training approach can unlock value within your organization. 🚀

## Understanding Immersive Training Courses

So, you're wondering what immersive training courses are all about? It's a great question and one that's been stirring quite a buzz recently. As we navigate through the countless types of training options available, it's essential to understand what sets immersive training apart. 🎯

### Transitioning from Traditional Classes to Virtual Learning

Traditionally, we're accustomed to full-day classes, typically condensed into two consecutive days. This format, while intense, ensures we're not paying for extra hotel stays or dealing with unnecessary travel logistics. However, the game has changed quite a bit with the advent of virtual learning.  💼

I've shifted all my classes into four half-day sessions in the virtual realm. This format offers two main benefits: attendees can still maintain their work schedule in the remaining part of the day, and the learning experience becomes more engaging and digestible.

### The Flipped Learning Approach

Moreover, I've been experimenting with the 'flipped learning' approach, where attendees are given small assignments to complete independently. These assignments encourage a more interactive, self-paced learning experience and represent the first step towards the immersive learning experience. 📚

## What is an Immersive Learning Experience?

But what exactly is an immersive learning experience? Well, it takes the idea of 'flipped learning' a step further. Instead of just reading, writing, and watching content, participants get a chance to implement their learnings in their real-world scenarios.

They then bring these experiences back to the class, share their insights, learn some more, and then go back and try out the new stuff in their organizations. 🔍

### Stretching Out the Learning Journey

We've now stretched the original four half-days to eight half-days spread over eight weeks. In each session, participants are assigned to execute within their organization.

For example, in the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) class, one might be tasked to define 'value' as it applies to their organization. 📅

### Sharing and Learning from Real-World Experiences

These real-world assignments provide a golden opportunity for participants to scrutinize their companies' workings and come back with invaluable insights to share with the rest of the class. 🌎

Participants from the same organization can discuss their shared experiences, while those from different organizations can compare and contrast, leading to a vibrant learning environment.

So there you have it - immersive learning is about taking flipped learning to a new level, incorporating assignments directly relevant to one's work and fostering a community of learners who share their experiences and learn from one another. It's about creating an authentic, transformative learning journey that is as engaging as it is educational.
