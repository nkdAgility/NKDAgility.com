# What are immersive training Scrum courses?

#scrum is a fairly tough transition to make if you come from a traditional #projectmanagement background. Adopting any #agileframework is hard, but #scrum is proven to be one of the best #productdevelopment frameworks available so it's worth getting it right.

Traditionally, a scrum.org #professionalscrummaster course or #professionalproductowner course takes 2 full days to complete, but we have been experimenting with deeper, more immersive learning experiences to really help people excel in a #scrumteam.

NKD Agility are investing in the 4-day and 8-day immersive learning courses because we believe it is going to be a game-changer in the industry and empower our #scrumtraining delegates to really make an impact in their working environments.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what #immersive training courses are and how they might benefit you.
