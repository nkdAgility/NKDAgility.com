1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,940
so the question is how big is the gap

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,920
between an average developer and a great

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,660
agile developer

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,100
I think there's two parts to that but

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,300
the main part that I think is really

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
important

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,720
is

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,640
um

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,100
I read a blog post years ago and I was

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,380
sitting reading it and the first

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,060
sentence it started with so it was about

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,340
this topic right what makes great

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,140
developers how what's learning all of

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,219
these kind of things and the first

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,100
sentence was if you're reading this

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:43,260
you're already in the top 10 percent

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,340
and that was what it said of the first

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,879
sentence

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,120
because so few people

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,680
are really engaged and care about the

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,280
work that they do

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,620
that they're willing to go invest and

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,899
investigate and figure out and solve and

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,320
try stuff and feel and pick themselves

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,659
up and try again right and this is true

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,380
regardless of whether we're talking

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,740
about our our skills in uh with people

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,960
with process right so that those those

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,240
are those agile group of group of skills

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,000
or product management or whatever it is

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,280
and but it also in the the the the the

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,140
technical right in the detail in the

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,180
weeds and how you actually do the work

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,159
that you do every day that is irrelevant

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,180
to the to the system with it which we're

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,100
working

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,740
and I think that is the fundamental

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,439
difference between somebody who is

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,100
average at doing their work and somebody

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,960
who is great at doing the work is

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,460
willingless to learn willingness to

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,740
adapt willingness to try things

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,740
investing your your own time and making

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,320
yourself better right

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,079
um one of my favorite folk in the world

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,479
uh David Starr who originally created

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,200
the the aps applying professional scrum

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,740
class back in the day and he had this a

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,340
a thing that he always said

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,959
um

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,580
what's

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,239
what do

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,620
martial artists and musicians have in

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,180
common

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,800
right what the martial artists and

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,060
musicians have in common and they're so

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,099
different that people are usually like

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,400
well I I don't know what do they have in

59
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,560
common they practice

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,560
why don't we when do we get practice

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,140
when when do we come off actually

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,420
performing right at the concert making

63
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,520
the production code and when do we get

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,200
the time to to practice

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,660
when we get things to try different

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,239
things to try new things that's actually

67
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,379
for me I feel like one of the the the

68
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,200
powers of training classes not

69
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,480
maybe the way not not the PowerPoint

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,640
training classes where you you basically

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,500
fall asleep and your brain dribbles out

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,120
your ears watching a PowerPoint

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,180
presentation

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,640
um but what I I try and do is bring in

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,220
some of the ideas of of flipped learning

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,660
right so I provide you with effectively

77
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,200
here's the content I'm going to teach

78
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,000
you in day one right go read it

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
if you read it

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,620
I don't need to tell you it we can then

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
talk about it and practice it in the

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,260
live session where we are together

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,760
because everybody reads at a different

84
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,900
pace everybody learns at a different

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,340
pace

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,580
perhaps you could spend some time

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,260
reading that content and then

88
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,879
we're gonna we're gonna answer the

89
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,260
questions we're going to dive into the

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,580
Nuance we're going to figure out how

91
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,440
that works we're going to do some

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,019
exercises so that we can maybe practice

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,140
some things that's the value of all

94
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,260
being together not in you know reading

95
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,860
some content of uh off of a slide so I

96
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,480
think that that that learning interest

97
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,819
in learning

98
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,819
is what makes it really powerful and I

99
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,680
do have a customer that leverages this

100
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,239
um and they actually provide their

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,620
developers everybody in their company

102
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,480
they provide everybody in their company

103
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,700
with a budget of about five thousand

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,080
Euros a year

105
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,360
for training

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,220
and you spend it how you like

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,019
it's up to you what training classes you

108
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,900
want to book what you want to learn

109
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,540
Perhaps Perhaps you just want to go do a

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,560
NLP class because you aren't very good

111
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,079
at that stuff and you want to understand

112
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,720
it better perhaps you do some cognitive

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,699
behavioral therapy uh classes because

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,639
that's what you feel you're lacking you

115
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,080
can pretty much do anything you want

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,699
with that budget I'm sure they might

117
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,400
frown if you wanted to go on a paper

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,940
airplane making class but

119
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,040
um the idea is that you know you as an

120
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,280
individual know

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,199
um what you don't know right kind of you

122
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,360
know what you don't understand you know

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,759
what you need to figure out and the

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,680
person best suited to direct the

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,120
learning that you need as yourself it

126
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,020
also has the huge benefit that it's

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,800
opt-in right it's self-service so the

128
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,620
worst type of uh um learning is mandated

129
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,600
in forced learning

130
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,240
um people generally don't pay attention

131
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,880
don't care as much

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,860
um and don't participate but if they

133
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,419
pick it themselves they're generally

134
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,460
more eager more engaged and that that's

135
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,520
the difference between the average

136
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:28,199
developer and the great agile developer

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,380
is engagement is practice is focus

138
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,360
that's what it is

139
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,220
