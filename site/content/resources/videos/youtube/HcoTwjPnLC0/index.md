## Defining Roles in Agile

So, from the get-go, I think it's important to set the record straight on this question 'is a Product Owner an Agile Project Manager? 🎯

Although plain and simple, my initial response is a resounding 'no'!

But allow me to elaborate. 🧐

## It's All About Perspective

The difference between a Product Owner and an Agile Project Manager is a matter of perspective.

Let's get one thing straight. An Agile Project Manager strives for a successful 'project', whereas a Product Owner works towards having a successful 'product'.  🧩

So, these two roles have distinctly different focuses, and that's key.

Different roles, different objectives, it's as simple as that.

## 'Project' vs 'Product' Challenge

Consider this: a 'project' within a product might falter, yet the overall 'product' can still thrive.

On the flip side, a 'project' might triumph while the value delivered to the customer falls flat.

## Laser Focus of a Product Owner

A Product Owner possesses that laser-sharp focus on maximising the value of the work done by the development team. That may or may not align perfectly with the goals of specific projects. 🎯

The bottom line is clear - a Product Owner and an Agile Project Manager, while both integral to the Agile process, are not in the same roles.

They have their unique responsibilities and clearly different areas of focus.  🚀
