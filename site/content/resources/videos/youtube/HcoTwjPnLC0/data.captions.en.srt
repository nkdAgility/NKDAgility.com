1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,720
is a product holder an agile project

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,099
manager

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:12,000
no I mean the the an agile

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,400
project manager is interested in a

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,400
successful project

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,580
a product owner is looking

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,619
to have a successful product right so a

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,779
project within a product might be

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,760
unsuccessful and we still have the

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,580
overall success of a product

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,800
and a project may be successful and we

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,000
still unsuccessfully deliver value to

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,559
our customer

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,440
so a product owner has that laser focus

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,120
on maximizing the value of the work done

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,460
by the team

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,460
which may or may not fulfill projects
