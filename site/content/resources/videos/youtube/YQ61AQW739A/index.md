🗺️ From Legacy Pain to Engineering Excellence—One Step at a Time
🎥 Episode 4 of 10 — From Legacy to Engineering Excellence with Azure DevOps

Modernizing isn’t a checklist.
It’s not a one-size-fits-all migration plan.
🧭 It’s a step-by-step journey—and every step reveals the next.

Whether you're stuck on:
🔁 TFVC
🚫 Manual builds
🐌 Slow, fragile releases
🧪 No automated testing
Or stuck approving deployments via email and hope…

There’s a way forward—and it doesn’t require a grand plan that gets destroyed the moment you start.

At NKD Agility, we guide you through a proven, hypothesis-driven migration roadmap:
🔹 Assess what’s real in your context
🔹 Pilot using your riskiest product (yes, that one)
🔹 Build automation, testing, and delivery confidence in small steps
🔹 Deploy using ring-based rollouts, not all-at-once chaos

And most importantly:
We help you uncover the real blockers—technical, cultural, or invisible friction—that are slowing everything down.

🛠️ Every sprint you chip away at that legacy weight, you're not just modernizing tech—you're building a culture of engineering excellence and technical leadership.

📌 Want a step-by-step path out of legacy pain?
