1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,639
building a road map to get you from your

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,400
legacy engineering practices or legacy

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,280
products to modern well-built

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,800
products, modern engineering practices

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
is is a it's I guess it's a little bit

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
of

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
it's going to be a very high level road

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,160
map.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,640
It's difficult to put structure

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,719
around the idea

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,800
of building

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
a a culture of engineering excellence.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Changing changing culture, changing

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:50,160
systems is more of an art than a

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,680
science. You bring science to the story,

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,480
right? Because you're you're going to

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,239
have data and telemetry. You're going to

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,559
bring things like things like OKRs,

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
right, which have here's what we're

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,479
trying to achieve, the objective, but

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,040
also here's the key results. Here are

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,880
the things that you're um that you're

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
going to

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,720
meet, right? Measure and meet to be able

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
to say whether you've been successful in

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,600
that thing. And we want to be bringing

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,479
that hypothesis

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,560
driven story to all of the things that

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
we do within the context of our of our

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
of our road map. So it's ultimately a a

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,720
transition from legacy to modern is a

32
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
road map of of hypo hypothesis. I think

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
that's the plural of hypothesis

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,320
hypothesis.

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,040
Um we we've we've done it before with

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,680
organizations. Um I'm working with an

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
organization just now to to to start

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
moving them. their own team foundation

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,119
version control TFVC

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,200
um moving them to git um modernizing

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
their tooling building out the DevOps

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
pipelines

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
and it's not something that you can just

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
plan up front and say it's going to work

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
because you don't know what you're going

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,759
to run into along the way there's too

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
many unknowns

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,840
um and it's unknown unknowns is is is

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,080
very very big so we want to

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
take one thing at a

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,440
And what I tend to recommend, it seems

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,440
like a little bit of an oxymoron, but um

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,160
take your biggest, riskiest, nastiest,

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,720
most difficult product, and that's your

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,160
pilot, right? You want you want to move

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,360
them from um TFVC into Git. You're going

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
to have to fix a bunch of stuff to do

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
that. You want to build out your your

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
automating pipelines. You're probably

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,720
going to have to um move things around.

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
let's call it move things around in

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,040
order to get your automation pipelines

63
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,879
working. And then um you're probably

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,680
going to want to look at bringing in

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
like what other stuff are outside of our

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,480
scope of our our scope of automation our

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,680
our current view of our automated

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,080
pipelines that we need to get to

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,560
production. Right? That that's that's

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,840
the story. One of one of the key

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,159
things that I always run with with a

72
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,080
with a customer

73
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,440
is I I get everybody together who is

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
involved in impro approving

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
that your product gets deployed to

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
production, right? Who are all the

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
people that need to be involved in that

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,159
story from from product developers all

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
the way up to somebody in management who

80
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,080
ticks an approval box or approves

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,879
something or whatever, right? All of

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,920
those people and ask them to write down

83
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,560
everything that needs to be true

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,159
in order for them

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
to be happy to ship that thing to

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,680
production, right? Everything that needs

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,120
to be true. So that could be a

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
particular measure. It could be some

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
piece of data. It could be something

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
they look for. Um it could be something

91
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
that has to be done. We just need to yes

92
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,000
this is done. True. Take right. We get

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
all of those things together. Those are

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,519
all the things that need to be in your

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:21,040
development process. And ultimately as

96
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,960
many of those things as humanly and

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,040
inhumanly possible need to be automated.

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,080
You want to automate everything. You you

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,840
shouldn't have you should not

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,040
you should not have any manual tasks

101
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,800
between developer committing a line of

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
code to your repository and it getting

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
into production.

104
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
And that's manual tasks i.e. people

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,919
following scripts or doing all those

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,919
things. It should be

107
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,560
topic automated build validated test

108
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
approvable request as automatedly as

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
possible as short as possible provable

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,560
request trunkbased development then kick

111
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,759
off your automation to deploy to some

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,039
subset of real users right I'm usually

113
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,600
pretty clear on when we're deploying to

114
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
production a new version of our products

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
production we're probably not talking

116
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,800
about deploying those new things to

117
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,000
everybody at once. You don't want to do

118
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,160
what Cloud Strike did, Crowdstrike did,

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,440
and take out half the world's internet,

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,520
right? That's not a good place to be.

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:38,240
You want to do like uh uh uh uh Windows

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,759
or Teams or Azure DevOps or um Google do

123
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,720
and you do a a a phased audience-based

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,280
roll out. I usually call it ring based

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,880
development but audience-based uh roll

126
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,600
out. So you have a that that part of

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,800
your transition road map

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,400
from legacy to modern is figuring out

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,880
what what does our

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,280
new in our new model what does our

131
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,840
branching structure look like? What does

132
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,919
our automated deployments look like?

133
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,319
Where do they go? Who sees them? who

134
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,160
interacts with them? How do we get as

135
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,880
quickly as possible to some subset of

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,120
real users? Not everyone, some subset of

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,440
real users. Uh a good example, although

138
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,240
it's still a really big sample set, is

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,800
when Microsoft ship Windows. Uh they

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,600
ship Windows daily to everybody inside

141
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,400
of Microsoft that takes the internal

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,639
build, which is not everybody. That's

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,080
going to be thousands of people, right?

144
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,479
Um, and then weekly they ship to a bunch

145
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,400
of people in the insiders group, which

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,600
is up to 17 million people

147
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,880
before they roll out to 900 million

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
people, right? Everybody using Windows,

149
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
900 million machines. They roll out to

150
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
17 million machines, not 900 million

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,800
machines.

152
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,520
And that phased roll out allows you to

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,080
understand, get telemetry, shorten that

154
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,479
feedback loop when you know you have a

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,759
long tail for your customers taking

156
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,319
taking parts of your product. This is

157
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,039
your short tail. That's your long tail.

158
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
And

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,759
understanding

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,919
how to do that, planning around figuring

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,280
that out is that's your transition road

162
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,440
map, right? that that's how we get the

163
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,199
information to be able to understand

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,400
what it is we need to do within the

165
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
context of your product or at least

166
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,560
what's the first step we're going to do

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
within the context of your product. And

168
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,280
if you're on TFVC, it's getting onto

169
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
Git. If you're already on Git and you

170
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,759
don't have automated builds, it's

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,000
automated builds, right? If you have

172
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
automated builds and you're in Git, it's

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
automated deployment if you don't have

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
that. If you don't include testing in

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
that matrix, that's the next step.

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Bringing in the automated testing. So

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,160
there's a clear road map of what's the

178
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
first thing to tackle, what's the second

179
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,120
thing to tackle and keep going down that

180
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,560
line. And as you're going down that

181
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,479
line, you're building a story of both

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
engineering excellence and technical

183
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,000
leadership within your organization. And

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,440
you need to do that in a way that that
