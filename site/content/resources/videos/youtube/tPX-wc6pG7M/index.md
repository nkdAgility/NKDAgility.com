In my journey through the world of agile and organisational effectiveness, I've often found myself pondering a critical question: If even large organisations struggle to deliver value and determine which products to build, what hope do smaller organisations have? With tighter budgets and fewer hands on deck, the challenge can seem insurmountable. However, I firmly believe that the issue isn't about scale; it's about engagement.

### The Power of Engagement

Engaging the people you have is paramount to creating products of the highest possible value. Traditional management practices often stifle this engagement. They dictate what employees should do, where they should go, and how they should execute their tasks. This top-down approach can lead to a disengaged workforce, where individuals are merely clocking in for a paycheck rather than contributing to a shared vision.

#### Key Insights on Engagement:

- **Decentralisation**: We need to rethink how we structure our organisations. By decentralising decision-making, we empower individuals to take ownership of their work. This not only boosts morale but also fosters innovation.
  
- **Democratisation**: Engaging everyone in the process means creating an environment where all voices are heard. This inclusivity can lead to richer ideas and solutions that might not emerge in a more hierarchical structure.

- **Principles Over Rules**: Instead of imposing strict rules, we should focus on establishing clear principles. When everyone understands the direction and goals of the organisation, they can leverage their unique skills to contribute effectively.

### Enabling Your Team

As leaders, it's crucial to recognise that we cannot know everything about how to maximise our team's capabilities. Our role is to enable our people to discover how best to utilise their skills for the benefit of the organisation. This requires a shift in mindset:

- **Foster a Culture of Care**: For your team to truly engage, they need to care about the organisation's success. If they are merely there for a paycheck, the outcomes will reflect that lack of investment.

- **Encourage Autonomy**: Allow your team members the freedom to explore and innovate. When people feel trusted to make decisions, they are more likely to take initiative and drive results.

- **Create a Shared Vision**: Ensure that everyone is aligned with the organisation's goals. A shared vision can motivate individuals to work collaboratively towards common objectives.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the path to delivering value in any organisation—large or small—lies in how we engage our people. By decentralising authority, democratising decision-making, and focusing on principles rather than rules, we can unlock the potential within our teams. Remember, it's not about the number of people or the size of the budget; it's about creating an environment where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute to the organisation's success. 

Let’s embrace this shift in perspective and work towards a more engaged and effective workforce. Thank you for joining me on this journey towards maximising value in our organisations.
