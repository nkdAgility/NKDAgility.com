1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,379
if even large organizations are

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,900
struggling to deliver value to figure

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,940
out what products they should build and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,340
how to maximize their effectiveness in

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,920
the market what chance do small

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,220
organizations have with smaller budgets

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,760
and less quantity of people to be able

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,699
to focus on this task and the reality is

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,420
is not about scale it's about your

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,759
ability to engage the people that you've

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,920
got in

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,559
um creating those products of the

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,260
highest possible value

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,379
traditional management practices inhibit

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,780
the ability of you to get the most out

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,760
of the people that you have because it

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,340
tells them what to do it tells them

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
where to go it tells them what to do and

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,160
it tells them how to do it

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,620
we need to start looking at these

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,660
whole process differently we need to

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,820
reorganize the way we structure

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:08,520
organizations in order to decentralize

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:11,640
democratize and engage the people that

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,340
we have in maximizing the value that our

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,100
organizations can deliver and that

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,820
doesn't come from

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,420
um rules it comes from principles

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,640
principles so that everybody knows and

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,100
understands the direction that we're

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,520
going and what we're trying to achieve

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,040
and we let them figure out how they can

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,619
leverage their own skills that they

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,140
understand in maximizing the benefits

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,259
for our organization that's not

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,040
something we can know as Leaders we have

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,740
to enable the people in our organization

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,560
to figure out how best to leverage their

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,619
capability for our benefit and for that

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,079
they need to be engaged they need to

41
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,960
care and they need to want the

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,060
organization to succeed if they're just

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
turning up for a paycheck and they don't

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,500
really care about your organization

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,680
you're not going to get those outcomes

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,680
thank you
