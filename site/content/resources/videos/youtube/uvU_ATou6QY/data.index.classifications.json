    "reasoning": "There are zero direct mentions of Service Level Expectation (SLE) or any of its defining concepts in the content. The article focuses entirely on the responsibilities and pitfalls of a product owner—discussing value delivery, ownership, vision, influencing direction, and decision making in the context of Agile—but does not mention SLE, nor does it allude to its calculation, application, or relevance within Scrum or Kanban frameworks. The closest related topic is 'inconsistent delivery', but this is discussed in terms of general delivery consistency and control, not in relation to cycle time forecasting, elapsed days, or probabilities. Metrics are referenced (e.g., burndown charts, vanity metrics), but not SLE, its components, or any of the authoritative sources named. No part of the discussion addresses SLE's use to improve predictability, manage expectations, or continuous improvement in the Kanban/Scrum sense. The audience is Agile practitioners but not those seeking information on SLE. As such, the content is almost entirely unrelated to the category as defined, justifying a very low confidence score, all dimensions scored at minimal or base values, and no penalties applied.",
