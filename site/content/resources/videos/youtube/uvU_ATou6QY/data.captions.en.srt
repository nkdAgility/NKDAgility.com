1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,099
what does failure look like for a

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,960
product owner

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,000
um I think I think it's it's very

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,619
quantifiable what failure looks like for

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,720
a product owner

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,359
um if if

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,279
you see a product

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:30,599
um that has per quality or

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,220
low value inconsistent delivery

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,600
probably a sign of a failing product

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,040
owner

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,739
um if the product owner is sitting there

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,480
just writing the requirements

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm not doing much else they're just

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,020
writing the requirements perhaps

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,600
ordering them but they're taking orders

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,340
from somebody else that's probably a

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,980
failing product owner

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,800
if if you ask people in the organization

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,840
or even on the team what is the vision

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,780
of the product what is it that we're

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,820
trying to achieve and they don't have an

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,640
answer or say well that sits on the wiki

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,460
right if people don't intrinsically know

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,340
uh what that is then we're probably

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,380
failing as a product owner

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,820
um if if we're as the product owner not

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,520
in control of the evolution and

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,560
direction of the product

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,600
um I maybe wouldn't put that in the

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
absolute failing category but we're

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,159
definitely not doing very well as a

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,320
product owner if we're not able to

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,060
influence and control the direction of

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,680
the product based on our understanding

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,420
of the market right that's something

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,100
that we we really do need to be able to

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,259
do

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,479
um not and that comes to the next one

40
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,720
which is not taking actual ownership of

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,460
the product this is our product we're

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
building this product we are making

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,020
decisions we're taking the risks we're

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,900
spending the money it needs to be our

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,420
product so taking that ownership

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,439
um of that is really important

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,860
um

48
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,520
and if it's all about perception over

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,960
reality then that's definitely a failing

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,700
product owner

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,740
um do we want the numbers to look good

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,420
or do we want to actually deliver value

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,399
in the product which brings in more

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,959
Revenue brings in more capability to the

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,819
organization

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,540
um there's a lot of focus on vanity

57
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,560
metrics in the industry and metrics if

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,620
you don't know that expression is

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,800
metrics that just uh make us look good

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,040
like a burn down being on the on the

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
line right so what does that actually

62
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,040
tell us anything about the product can

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,319
you be on that line and uh things still

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,680
suck yes of course you can

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,840
so let's focus on vanity metrics more on

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,220
reality of the product what's going on

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,620
what we need to do like uh Satya

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,379
um writing down eight billion dollars

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,599
for Nokia that's looking at the reality

70
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,400
of the situation

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,739
um and understanding it and rather than

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Reaching For Fairies and Magic that

73
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,140
we're going to be successful with this

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,540
going

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,500
no we're done we need to cut our losses

76
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,300
on that

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,040
that's what being a product well that's

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,879
what a failing product owner looks like

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,800
right
