As a [product owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), I often reflect on what failure truly looks like in our role. It’s a topic that resonates deeply with me, and I believe it’s essential for anyone in this position to understand the signs of a failing product owner. 

### Recognising the Signs of Failure

From my experience, failure as a product owner can be quite quantifiable. Here are some key indicators that suggest we might not be hitting the mark:

- **Poor Quality or Low Value**: If the product we’re delivering lacks quality or fails to provide value, it’s a clear sign that something is amiss. A product that doesn’t meet user needs or expectations is a reflection of our inability to guide its development effectively.

- **Inconsistent Delivery**: When delivery timelines are erratic, it often points to a lack of control over the product’s evolution. As product owners, we should strive for consistency, ensuring that our teams are aligned and focused on delivering value regularly.

- **Requirement-Driven Mindset**: If I find myself merely writing requirements and taking orders from others, I know I’m not fulfilling my role. A product owner should be actively involved in shaping the product, not just documenting what others want.

- **Lack of Vision**: If team members or stakeholders can’t articulate the product vision, we’re failing. It’s crucial that everyone involved understands what we’re trying to achieve. If the vision is buried in a wiki and not communicated effectively, we’re missing the mark.

- **Inability to Influence Direction**: While it may not be an outright failure, if I’m not able to influence the product’s direction based on market understanding, it’s a sign that I need to step up my game. A product owner must be in tune with the market and able to steer the product accordingly.

### Taking Ownership

One of the most critical aspects of being a successful product owner is taking ownership of the product. This means:

- **Making Decisions**: We need to be the ones making decisions about the product, taking calculated risks, and managing the budget. It’s our responsibility to ensure that the product aligns with both user needs and business goals.

- **Focusing on Reality Over Perception**: It’s easy to get caught up in vanity metrics—those numbers that look good on paper but don’t reflect the true state of the product. For instance, a burn down chart might show progress, but if the product is still lacking in quality, what does that really tell us? 

- **Understanding the Bigger Picture**: I often think of Satya Nadella’s decision to write down eight billion dollars for Nokia. That was a moment of clarity, recognising the reality of the situation rather than clinging to the hope of success. As product owners, we must be willing to make tough decisions when necessary.

### Conclusion

In summary, a failing product owner can be identified by poor product quality, inconsistent delivery, a lack of vision, and an inability to take ownership. It’s vital that we focus on delivering real value rather than getting lost in metrics that merely serve to make us look good. 

If you’re in a product owner role, I encourage you to reflect on these points. Are you truly owning your product? Are you delivering value? If you’d like to discuss this further or share your experiences, I’d love to chat. Feel free to book a coffee with me through Naked Agility. 

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your thoughts!
