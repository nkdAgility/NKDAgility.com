You want to be the one setting the market. You don't want to be following your competitors. You want to be the one setting the market trends. 

In order to do that, you have to be on a tight release frequency. You have to be continuously delivering your product to production. You have to be getting every change you make in front of real users. 

That is going to help you adapt to market opportunities, deal with market surprises, and maximise the value that you create in your product.
