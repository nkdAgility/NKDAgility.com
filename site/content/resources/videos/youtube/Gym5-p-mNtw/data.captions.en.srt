1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,480
most

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,280
organizations don't realize the amount

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,240
of waste that they have in their system

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,360
the amount of money that they're

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
hemorrhaging because they don't have a

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,359
focus on engineering Excellence this

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,160
this this idea within the context of of

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,439
of of agile of business agility of

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
everything being continuous right so

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,360
you've get continuous integration

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
continuous delivery continuous feedback

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,760
continuous testing that continuous

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,840
nature that things are happening

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,239
dynamically enables you to find problems

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,559
quicker so the problems are smaller that

16
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,000
eliminates some waste but it also

17
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,920
enables you to collect data and

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
Telemetry and understand what's going on

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,680
a little bit more easily which means

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,920
that you can identify problem areas and

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,199
do something about them before those

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:05,000
costs spiral out of control I work with

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:08,159
so many customers that have so much

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,720
waste I I I've got some Dora metrics

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,240
here I think not all of them are Dora

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,960
most of them are Dora metrics we use it

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,080
to tell this exact point for for for

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
agile leaders in our agile leadership

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,360
classes but we talk about a number of

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,119
different metrics right and if we're

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,520
talking about a $1 one Euro one pound

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,360
budget and how much of that how much of

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,479
that pound dollar euro ends up as actual

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,240
value delivered in your product right

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,880
and and and what what do you measuring

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,479
to understand your return on investment

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,759
on on that story so these are just four

38
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,439
metrics that I'm going to use there are

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,799
many more metrics that you could be

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,079
looking at that can can impact on this

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,079
um but one of the biggest ones is

42
00:01:53,079 --> 00:02:01,200
innovation rate what percentage of your

43
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:04,119
time of your people's time do they spend

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,039
innovating rather than augmenting

45
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,440
existing functionality or support and

46
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,520
maintenance right so it's net new

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,920
capability within your product and this

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,840
is is is really it's a really important

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,800
piece because it's the reason why

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Netflix uh creates a new show rather

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,560
than doing the second series of that

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,680
show that you you liked and it's because

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,160
when you do a second series right you

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,760
augment existing functionality when you

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,239
do a second series your audience for the

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,560
second series is going to be smaller

57
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,000
than the first series unless there's

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,879
some kind of information that leads

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,640
differently the default is that the

60
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
second series is going to have less

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,360
audience right so it's going to make

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,640
less money than the first series so if

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,319
your second series is going to cost just

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,319
as much as a first series wouldn't it be

65
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,120
better to invest that money in a first

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
series to get a higher potential

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
audience it's a bet right a higher

68
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,720
potential audience return than it is do

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
a second series of an existing if the

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,720
existing Series has enough of an

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,319
audience and enough of a demand for a

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,879
second series then it's probably worth

73
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,000
it right you'll get your return on

74
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
investment but otherwise it's not worth

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,319
it which is why you see the rise of

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,840
limited series right I think we'll see

77
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,319
the rise of limited features and

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,400
products but Innovation rate is around

79
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,239
39% on average that was the the last dor

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,280
metrics that I I kind of looked at so

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,760
29% of it budget goes on net new

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,560
functionality that's new customers new

83
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,560
markets opening out new capabilities for

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,159
your product that's not a lot that's 29

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,239
cents on the dollar 29 uh cents on the

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,959
Euro 29 p on the pound that's terrible

87
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,599
right and that's just one metric so now

88
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,439
we we only have 29 cents of big Roi in

89
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,480
our product or big potential Roi in our

90
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:09,200
product what about our on product index

91
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,799
that's what percentage of our Engineers

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,280
time do they spend or our people's time

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,280
do they spend working on the product

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,880
versus doing other

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:23,199
stuff right um the average is about 80%

96
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,440
of their time they spend on the product

97
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,039
20% on other stuff so we would be down

98
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,600
to 23 cents on the dollar what about

99
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,639
usage index what percentage of the

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,479
features that you build in your product

101
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,840
are actually used by your customer right

102
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,440
the the the industry average is about

103
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,000
35% 35% of the features that you build

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,680
are used by your customer that means the

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
rest is

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
waste right it's not really all waste

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,840
because sometimes you need to build

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,680
features that people don't like to find

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,720
out what they do like so that would

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,880
wouldn't be waste that would be learning

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,160
right so some of it's learning it's

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,400
difficult to quantify quantify the

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
learning but certainly a huge piece of

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,639
it is waste lots of companies build lots

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,800
of features that your users have

116
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,039
absolutely zero interest in right you be

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,960
surprised at go ask your engineering

118
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,400
teams what their usage index is what

119
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,560
percentage of the features that they've

120
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,479
built are used and used Often by their

121
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,759
customers so Microsoft has a has a a

122
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,520
measure that they use which is monthly

123
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,720
active users for each feature in your

124
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,039
product what are the monthly active

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,479
users if you can't answer that question

126
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,840
you have no idea whatsoever whether your

127
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,720
features are being used or not so why

128
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,479
are you building them how do you know

129
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
you should be adding new features to

130
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,360
this piece of functionality right that

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,560
that that augmenting existing if we

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,639
don't even know what our user base is

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,759
why are we adding why are we spending

134
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,000
money on it right it's a it's a it's a

135
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,440
blind BET right that's a bad bet it's

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,280
completely unhedged but 35% usage rate

137
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,199
now brings us down to 8 cents on the

138
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,000
dollar so we went from a dollar to 28

139
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,720
cents on the dollar 23 cents on the

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,080
dollar now8 cents on the dollar and

141
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,599
we're not even finished yet because if

142
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,360
we're building a application that people

143
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:26,840
install if you look at things like

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,280
Windows right what percentage of us the

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,199
user Bas is on the latest version of the

146
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,280
product now the industry average is

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,319
about 70% right so 30% of users are on

148
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,039
an older version of the product I have

149
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,000
lots of customers where that's not even

150
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,520
remotely true that it's a much smaller

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,360
percentage on the latest version of your

152
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,840
product so that brings us down to six

153
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,840
cents in the

154
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,759
dollar if

155
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,520
your your return on investment for every

156
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,800
dollar you spend you get 6 cents that's

157
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,319
0.06

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,319
% return on investment is that a good

159
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,720
investment I think it's not a good

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,000
investment I think we need to do a whole

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:17,039
bunch of work in understanding why

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,759
that's so low and dealing with the

163
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,960
reasons why it's so low so in in our

164
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,319
example here the biggest the biggest hit

165
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,520
at the start was Innovation rate right

166
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,520
do you even know your Innovation rate

167
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,479
percentage of time on Innovation percent

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,520
percentage of time spent on ADD

169
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,879
augmenting existing functionality

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,759
support and

171
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,759
maintenance right what are those three

172
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
percentages for your business you should

173
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,400
you should absolutely understand that

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,599
for every product that you

175
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,039
have the next biggest thing is is usage

176
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,479
Index right what percentage of the

177
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,159
features are actually used by your

178
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,240
customers do you understand that are you

179
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,159
collecting the Telemetry that you need

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,960
to understand that so that you can make

181
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,240
decis

182
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:08,680
decisions on where you're investing your

183
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,879
capital and not letting costs spiral out

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,639
of

185
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:18,520
control agility is part of this story
