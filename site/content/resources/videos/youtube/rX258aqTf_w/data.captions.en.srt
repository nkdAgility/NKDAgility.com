1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,400
and what circumstances is agile

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,400
Consulting appropriate

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,800
so I guess first we have to quantify

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,720
what is agile Consulting

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,100
right we probably have to quantify that

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,699
first for for me agile Consulting

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,080
is almost always what I do with

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,720
customers

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,820
I find that

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,460
the only the only reason businesses

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,500
think they need agile coaches

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,480
is because of a systematic lack of

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,860
leadership within the business they've

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,780
lots of managers

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,760
but not so many leaders

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,579
so they need somebody to come in and

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,559
fill that servant leadership Gap and

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,780
they hire in external people but

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,899
unfortunately

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,640
that's a Core Business practice

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,899
and you don't Outsource core business

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,579
practices

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,300
right because that's what makes your

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,400
business successful so those those those

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,360
contractors that you hire in to do to to

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,560
to to be long-term agile coaches

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,100
actually end up hurting your business

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
because as they change out as they leave

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,640
you're upsetting the people that are in

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,040
your business because they're not that

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,500
that as permanent a fixture they're paid

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,420
differently they're not included in the

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,100
training right they're not included in

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,200
lots of things that you would you would

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,820
be doing as a team as a group

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,920
um so I I I feel that there's very well

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,680
there's maybe a Kickstart value in agile

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,159
coaches right but in reality in a

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,500
long-term business the value is in

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,900
creating agile coaches inside of your

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,360
business finding the people inside of

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,520
your organization who can help support

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,100
your organization and make that move

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,720
from management to leadership so that

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,240
they can help fulfill your business

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,920
desires right and internal Core Business

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,399
need

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,939
um so I I feel like any organization

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,360
that thinks they need an agile coach

50
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:12,959
probably doesn't they probably need some

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,800
Consulting agile Consulting to help them

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,360
understand what they need to do

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
in order to make their business more

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,739
successful

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,680
right and and that's that intrinsic

56
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,459
difference is agile Consulting is not

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,640
thinking I need to be here for for six

58
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,879
to 12 months in order to to you know

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,640
have my income for the year it's it's

60
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,379
I'm I'm here for the next two weeks I'm

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,220
here for a week I'm here for a month I'm

62
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,599
gonna I'm gonna figure out how to solve

63
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,599
solve your problems providing Solutions

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,840
right like things to try they're not

65
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,700
maybe the end solution but they're where

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
do I start because because businesses

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,900
have that question they have that

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,780
question what do I do where do I start I

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,239
don't understand this thing what where

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,940
where should I go from where I am right

71
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,180
now and and agile coaching doesn't often

72
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,440
provide that answer because the agile

73
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,220
coach

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,720
um

75
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,280
is is looking at that systematic slow

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,519
engaging with people type of model

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,860
whereas Consulting is more the you know

78
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,360
we want to figure out what switch to

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,060
flip that's probably the best

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,400
explanation is flipping switches

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,220
um so there's some really good

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,879
um data out there talking about how

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,360
um

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:40,140
the traditional transformational model

85
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,980
in organizations is actually it's it's

86
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,780
not working it all it results in is lots

87
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,560
of feeble implementations of agile

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,180
fragile implementations of agile and

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,640
um um The Continuous need to maintain

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,739
that external help and support because

91
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
we actually never changed our business

92
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,299
right we didn't actually change anything

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,760
so as soon as that crutch of that agile

94
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,680
coaching is removed the whole thing

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
collapses and falls back into a

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,360
terroristic commanding control control

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,819
mass and there are a whole bunch of new

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,959
techniques uh uh there's open space

99
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,440
agile

100
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,560
um open space beta talking about how do

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,139
we enact change in our organization over

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,940
a very short space of time change as

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,460
flipping right you're going to flip a

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,580
switch something will be just different

105
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,139
right in the way we do things and how do

106
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,660
you figure out what those switches are

107
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,860
well you can have Consultants come men

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,259
and help you figure out what those

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,360
switches are but the reality is the

110
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,400
people in your organization already know

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,960
what those switches are isn't I think

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,060
that's the art of Consulting isn't it

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
coming in and telling people

114
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,919
what they already know right that's

115
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,080
that's kind of the art of Consulting and

116
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,720
the people in your organization already

117
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,940
know what changes need to be made you

118
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,280
just need to empower them and I think

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,560
one of the core reasons organizations

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,360
need Consultants rather than coaches is

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,340
Consultants are going to help them

122
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,479
understand what it is they just

123
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,479
fundamentally need to change
