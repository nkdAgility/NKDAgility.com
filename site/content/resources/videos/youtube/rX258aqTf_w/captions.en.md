and what circumstances is agile Consulting appropriate

so I guess first we have to quantify what is agile Consulting right we probably have to quantify that first for for me agile Consulting is almost always what I do with customers

I find that the only the only reason businesses think they need agile coaches is because of a systematic lack of leadership within the business they've lots of managers but not so many leaders

so they need somebody to come in and fill that servant leadership Gap and they hire in external people but unfortunately that's a Core Business practice and you don't Outsource core business practices right because that's what makes your business successful

so those those those contractors that you hire in to do to to to be long-term agile coaches actually end up hurting your business because as they change out as they leave you're upsetting the people that are in your business because they're not that that as permanent a fixture they're paid differently they're not included in the training right they're not included in lots of things that you would you would be doing as a team as a group

um so I I I feel that there's very well there's maybe a Kickstart value in agile coaches right but in reality in a long-term business the value is in creating agile coaches inside of your business finding the people inside of your organization who can help support your organization and make that move from management to leadership so that they can help fulfill your business desires right and internal Core Business need

um so I I feel like any organization that thinks they need an agile coach probably doesn't they probably need some Consulting agile Consulting to help them understand what they need to do in order to make their business more successful

right and and that's that intrinsic difference is agile Consulting is not thinking I need to be here for for six to 12 months in order to to you know have my income for the year it's it's I'm I'm here for the next two weeks I'm here for a week I'm here for a month I'm gonna I'm gonna figure out how to solve solve your problems providing Solutions right like things to try they're not maybe the end solution but they're where do I start because because businesses have that question they have that question what do I do where do I start I don't understand this thing what where where should I go from where I am right now

and and agile coaching doesn't often provide that answer because the agile coach is is looking at that systematic slow engaging with people type of model whereas Consulting is more the you know we want to figure out what switch to flip that's probably the best explanation is flipping switches

um so there's some really good um data out there talking about how um the traditional transformational model in organizations is actually it's it's not working it all it results in is lots of feeble implementations of agile fragile implementations of agile and um um The Continuous need to maintain that external help and support because we actually never changed our business right we didn't actually change anything

so as soon as that crutch of that agile coaching is removed the whole thing collapses and falls back into a terroristic commanding control control mass and there are a whole bunch of new techniques uh uh there's open space agile

um open space beta talking about how do we enact change in our organization over a very short space of time change as flipping right you're going to flip a switch something will be just different right in the way we do things and how do you figure out what those switches are

well you can have Consultants come men and help you figure out what those switches are but the reality is the people in your organization already know what those switches are isn't I think that's the art of Consulting isn't it coming in and telling people what they already know right that's that's kind of the art of Consulting and the people in your organization already know what changes need to be made you just need to empower them

and I think one of the core reasons organizations need Consultants rather than coaches is Consultants are going to help them understand what it is they just fundamentally need to change
