[Music]

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,939
you

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,239
[Music]

4
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,380
hello my name is Martin Henchy wood

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm the owner at Naked agility in

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,410
Glasgow Scotland and I've had a couple

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,160
of questions come in from a few Foulke

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,980
and I wanted to cover a few of those

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,300
things so first off I'm going to be

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:01:00,680
doing this as often as I can I think

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,290
it's important to help people in in this

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,520
this time it can be very difficult to

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,700
figure out what's going on and get

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,760
things done so we're going to going to

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,740
look at this so the first thing that I

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,229
want to talk about a little bit was

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,820
remote working a lot of us are in that

18
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:25,820
if I probably most of us are in that

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,390
space of having to work remotely we're

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:35,000
gonna be working distributed from our

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:38,200
our teams and while we talk about in

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,770
scrum and agile in general we talk about

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,290
co-located teams the reality is when

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,280
these types of circumstances arise and

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,680
and even just based on your

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,270
organizational context you might work in

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,150
an organization that doesn't have

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,770
everybody in the same place and it can

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:06,280
make things very difficult so while in

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:15,170
one of the the values of scrum is focus

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:16,659
openness we are trying to have a group

32
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,840
of people who can work together

33
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:24,860
effectively regardless of the context so

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,690
we need to think about the values we

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,510
want to have people working together as

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,879
closely as possible and obviously in the

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,790
current context that closely as possible

38
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,760
is over webcam and using video

39
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,749
conferencing technology so we just have

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,950
to figure that out but don't forget to

41
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:48,300
continuously and

42
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:52,140
even though we are separated by space

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,680
and and only doing videoconferencing we

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,260
still need to be able to figure out what

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,900
the best way to use the tools that we've

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,070
got so don't get stuck on a tool that is

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,340
not working for you

48
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,940
make sure you continuously adapt try new

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,780
things figure it out I did a web

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,980
conference on Wednesday using Microsoft

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,510
teams and I found that it wasn't

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:24,000
particularly awesome for for that set up

53
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,090
just in the way that I wanted to do it

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,610
it wasn't quite working I'm going to try

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,100
some other technologies but I used teams

56
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,290
a lot for other things so I think it's

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,050
important when you're remote working to

58
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,330
think about how you interact with other

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,330
people are are you interacting with your

60
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,950
teammates enough do they do they know

61
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,050
what you're working on do you know what

62
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,680
they are working on make sure we have

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,620
that focus and context to understand

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,450
what's going on and what we're doing we

65
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,390
talked about this a lot in the

66
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:02,489
professional scrum master class I'm

67
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:06,720
hoping to do some remote PSM once the

68
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,420
the scrum community figures out how best

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,940
to achieve that we're gonna try some

70
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,200
stuff and see see if it works I have a

71
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,019
class coming up that I'm going to move

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,850
to to remote and we'll see see what

73
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,650
happens

74
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,410
so I think it's also important to think

75
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,870
about taking taking some time that idea

76
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:33,750
of poo-poo the chain while we're in this

77
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:36,780
remote state and we're maybe don't have

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:41,250
such laser focus on delivering value

79
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,380
than we had when we were in person high

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,590
bandwidth in person and we can still

81
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:51,060
focus on some of the things that need

82
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,039
our our help so in the the scrum world

83
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,449
particularly in all of product

84
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,539
development the work at

85
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,340
we're doing is really complex and it's

86
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:04,139
not really suited to that production

87
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,999
line mentality but our DevOps pipeline

88
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,900
is suited to that production line

89
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:14,710
mentality and if we want to UM take an

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,749
idea from our product owner and turn it

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,759
into working software we've got that bit

92
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,919
that we can't understand how long it's

93
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,789
going to take because it's it's the

94
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,650
creative endeavor of solving that

95
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,050
cognitive problem so we're going to

96
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,050
solve that problem but then we make a

97
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,620
change to the software we commit that to

98
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,499
our repository and then somehow it goes

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,999
off and ends up in production how

100
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:43,930
quickly does that happen

101
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:46,080
and how that that is your production

102
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,879
line that's the bit that we want to

103
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,729
shorten and figure out and how to make

104
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,969
as fast as possible and I usually use an

105
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,889
example from Brian Harry who was the

106
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:01,240
product unit manager for Azure DevOps

107
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:03,550
and he talked about zero build I think

108
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,699
he called it a zero build an awesome

109
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,569
phrase but he he talked about it as and

110
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:14,110
if he does our build of the product so

111
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:17,499
the team creates a version of visual

112
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,990
studio and TFS at the time and then they

113
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:21,879
ship it to production it has to go

114
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,169
through a whole bunch of or at the time

115
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,629
it had to go through a whole bunch of

116
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:30,459
checks so there was legal there was

117
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:34,779
validation though all kinds of steps

118
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:36,580
along that way and he would look at not

119
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:40,029
how long it took to get through that

120
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,310
process because there may be things just

121
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:44,589
now while we're not so good that would

122
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,939
fail so that's going to go back into the

123
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,339
feedback loop so you're not looking at

124
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,009
how long it takes to get your software

125
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,419
out the door because there's some stuff

126
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,300
engineering-wise we need to fix in there

127
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,310
and that's good to disrupt our data but

128
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,870
once we've got that version of the

129
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,990
product in production if we do another

130
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,120
brand new build from exactly the same

131
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,830
version of code that passed all the

132
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,350
checks and

133
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,630
see how long it takes that to go through

134
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,800
the process so that's your zero bill

135
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,110
does zero changes in the code the zero

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,720
changes in the platform how long does it

137
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,450
take you to get that into production and

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,760
that's your your zero build time that's

139
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,700
what you want to focus on as a

140
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,950
production line as we need to make this

141
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,050
as short as possible we need to reduce

142
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,020
the process and in order to do that you

143
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:43,780
need to get feedback from every stage

144
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,700
along the way I just found this diagram

145
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,000
on the internet that is enough stages

146
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,920
that I think was valid so you need to

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,100
focus on engineering excellence you need

148
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,830
to focus on improving your definition of

149
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,280
done but also focus on team building you

150
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:03,730
want your team to care that these things

151
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,690
are important it's important to get into

152
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,110
production as quickly as possible

153
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,420
because without feedback we're we may

154
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,010
not be building the right thing I need

155
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,920
to figure out how to do that and or does

156
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,450
that mean to focus on on people and

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,840
something I've been looking at recently

158
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:24,370
is how to use extreme gamification and

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,700
to help people understand how to work

160
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,820
together a little bit better some of

161
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,210
those things that I'm trying to get I

162
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,850
get people to look at it is through

163
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,760
board games those are a board game that

164
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:44,020
I had in mind called pandemic which is a

165
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,650
cooperative game of of saving humanity

166
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,300
from pandemic so it's kind of apt but

167
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,330
one of the things that you see when a

168
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,510
group of people play that game is that

169
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,640
it's very that game is very prone to one

170
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,760
person telling everybody else what to do

171
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,370
which is kind of analogous with software

172
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,480
development so if you can get a team

173
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,660
together for our it's 45 minutes to an

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,190
hour to play the game and do a diagnosis

175
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,820
at the end get the team to play the game

176
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,310
together and then talk about who you

177
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,050
know you're observing potentially is a

178
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,760
scrum master and then

179
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,910
have a discussion about the different

180
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,220
interactions that you saw during the

181
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,860
game so you can have that kinda safe

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,070
environment where you can run a little

183
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,230
experiment with your team it's fun for

184
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,490
them so they get into it and they forget

185
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,520
that you're running an experiment

186
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,440
because they're getting into the game

187
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,230
and solving the the puzzle that they're

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,330
trying to solve but you can you can have

189
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,670
us two observations and usually you'll

190
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,440
find that there's one or two people that

191
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,450
are very loud everybody else follows

192
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,670
along how do you make sure you get

193
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,440
everybody's opinion here'd the people

194
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,180
that are very loud to understand and

195
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,920
that they're maybe being overbearing in

196
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,430
in that conversation so that's part of

197
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:10,150
that focus and on people and how people

198
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,770
work together and I think cooperative at

199
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:17,080
fun games are definitely a way to to

200
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:22,290
help make some of those ideas a little

201
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:28,420
bit more real so I also got a question

202
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:33,060
from one of my old friends Ian frame he

203
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:36,940
was talking about UX in the context of

204
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:40,690
larger organizations and how do you make

205
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:45,760
sure that UX is not just an afterthought

206
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:51,970
now I've worked with the author of lean

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,200
UX Jeff on this that we have a class

208
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,830
from scrum that are called the

209
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,160
professional scrum with UX which he

210
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,910
describes as I as an olive branch to the

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,710
UX community the US community is off

212
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,000
doing their own thing because they're

213
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:11,230
getting pushed away by engineering teams

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,550
but really the thing that they're doing

215
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:18,250
is one of the most important parts of

216
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:21,730
product delivery understanding what your

217
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,310
product is what you're gonna do to solve

218
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,620
the business need how you're going to do

219
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,930
that and how those interactions and

220
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,300
behaviors of users that you're going to

221
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,100
change and I think that's that's so

222
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,670
unbelievably important too

223
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:40,450
at product owner and building the right

224
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,460
thing story that it it's it's going to

225
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,010
be detrimental to any organization that

226
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:51,850
is leaving it behind and you need to get

227
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:54,420
your your UX skills available on the

228
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,130
scrum teams with the people that are

229
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,550
doing the work because they are doing

230
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:05,800
work as well and I do think there's some

231
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:08,470
I guess confusion and difficulty around

232
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,730
what happens with long-running work you

233
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,530
might have a bunch of stuff that tastes

234
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:17,650
longer than Sprint to complete so how do

235
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:22,270
we deal with that and the reality is we

236
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:23,980
we have that built in to scrum in scrum

237
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,390
we have something called refinement

238
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,860
which is that work that the team does on

239
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,890
things that are coming up in future

240
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,160
sprints to create the most awesome

241
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:39,130
ordered backlog possible and so that

242
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,670
everybody on the team fully understands

243
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,680
what is in the backlog that you're

244
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,690
planning on bringing into the sprint by

245
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,240
the time you get to the sprint planning

246
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,340
session so in order to do that you have

247
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,410
to spend a bunch of time refining that

248
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,720
product backlog probably looking out

249
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,350
into the future the recommendation is to

250
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,960
start with about a current sprint plus

251
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,810
two more whatever that means to you that

252
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,110
might be your effective planning horizon

253
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,560
but really you need to plan as far out

254
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,260
as you need to action the things that

255
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,910
you find so if you find you need some

256
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,470
extra information or you need to do some

257
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:23,530
paper prototyping or you need to get

258
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,170
some some something in front of users in

259
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,360
order to understand better what the need

260
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,800
is you need to know far enough in

261
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,810
advance for you to deal with those

262
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,080
things so how do you do that in this

263
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,720
refinement and so there's a lot of UX

264
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,860
work working with the product owner and

265
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,330
the development team in refinement just

266
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,110
like there's a lot of security work

267
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,910
there there's a lot of architecture

268
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,339
car there's a lot of testing work all of

269
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,190
all of the skills are required in the

270
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,480
scrum team so there's this terminology

271
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,100
that I hear used a lot called dual track

272
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,550
dual track agile dual track scrubs

273
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,779
you'll track UX well whatever you want

274
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,329
to call it people are using lots of

275
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,610
different terminology but the idea

276
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,730
behind dual track is not that there's

277
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:13,610
two separate streams of work and it's

278
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,200
that there's there's one development

279
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:21,470
team that moves through different modes

280
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,810
for a particular backlog item so you get

281
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,000
something on your backlog pbi product

282
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,350
backlog item it might be a user story it

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,560
might be a requirement whatever you call

284
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:34,010
it there's something on your backlog and

285
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:37,630
it probably starts a little bit vague

286
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:41,329
so we maybe need to do some amount of

287
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:44,000
discovery work to understand what that

288
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:48,500
item is to get the team up to speed to

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,860
really focus on and how to to bring all

290
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:58,010
of that together and then that will move

291
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,540
into maybe a combination of discovery

292
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,060
and delivery maybe we're going to figure

293
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:07,630
out what's the smallest possible thing

294
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:11,089
that we can build that will help us

295
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,560
understand whether to continue to invest

296
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:21,640
in that or that we need to build

297
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:26,060
something else that's that and yep

298
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:29,600
that's that a discovery versus delivery

299
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,510
work and then maybe you your entire

300
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,190
engineering team dives into delivery for

301
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,699
the period of a sprint

302
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,339
so we deliver a bunch of things and then

303
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,690
we shoot back up into discovery again

304
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,029
where we're going to analyze the data

305
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,730
that we're collecting for that we're

306
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:48,620
going to look at what our hypothesis was

307
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,300
and whether the features that we've

308
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,010
built have managed to change user

309
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,640
behavior in the way that we expect

310
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:58,160
create the outcomes that we expect and

311
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,940
then we come up with what are we going

312
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,530
to go do

313
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,470
next to solve that problem so that will

314
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:09,110
bring us back down into delivery again

315
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,780
so we keep going through that cycle for

316
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,630
a particular idea and that result might

317
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,070
result in many PBIS that are delivered

318
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:21,620
over multiple Sprint's as we flip

319
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,260
between discovery and delivery and

320
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,470
somewhere in between so the reality is

321
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,400
that things on your backlog and are not

322
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,410
just you I work they're not just

323
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,390
engineering work just like they're not

324
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,430
just coding work not just testing work

325
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,520
not just architecture or security work

326
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:44,900
and each product backlog item should

327
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:49,070
represent a unit of value and that unit

328
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:53,570
of value should include coding testing

329
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:56,210
security architecture as well as UX as

330
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,070
well so what are the UX ideas you need

331
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,740
to do in there and deciding how much

332
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,470
time you want to spend on UX for a

333
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:09,290
particular backlog item will depend on

334
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:11,750
and how unsure you are of whether that

335
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,210
thing will provide value sometimes if

336
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,600
it's just a small simple low-risk thing

337
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:22,160
I would just go build it and see if it's

338
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,560
useful and if it's a high risk a big

339
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,540
thing then maybe I want to do some paper

340
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,480
prototyping maybe I want to do some

341
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,430
additional investigation work as a

342
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,260
development team around that so it's

343
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,080
important that the entire development

344
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,110
team is involved in that process and in

345
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,510
the the PSU professional scrum with UX

346
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,660
we focus very heavily on team

347
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:48,110
accountability for UX but there are many

348
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,650
things in UX that you need a significant

349
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:54,460
amount of expertise to be able to

350
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:57,590
deliver on you need expedience training

351
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:02,210
understanding within the UX world of

352
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:04,400
many years so everybody can't learn all

353
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,430
of that just like everybody can be deep

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,580
security expects experts or deep testing

355
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:14,059
experts are deep pudding

356
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,830
you're going to have deep UX experts but

357
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,129
there are is a certain amount of work

358
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:22,429
that makes sense for everybody to help

359
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:25,269
out with so one of the things we focus

360
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:29,480
on I have one on the wall behind me is

361
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:31,730
lean UX canvas this is from Jeff's

362
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,500
website this is the second version lanky

363
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:40,669
is v5 but it says v2 on it but just lean

364
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:43,309
UX canvas and we focus on this for an

365
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:46,850
engineering team because it helps them

366
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,919
understand the value and context within

367
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,080
work which they're making decisions

368
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,230
every day on how to build parse the

369
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,990
product and so this is a really

370
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,440
important tool that I think anybody on

371
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,350
an engineering team can learn how to how

372
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:10,850
to use and utilize but you still need

373
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:14,210
that deep UX expertise to tackle some of

374
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,879
those harder core things that you might

375
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,679
do so something you should have is all

376
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:22,730
of the things in your backlog should

377
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:27,460
include some amount of UX work depending

378
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:30,590
on the context also we talked about

379
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,629
emergent design just like we talked

380
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,460
about emergent architecture a product

381
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:39,649
backlog supports emergent architecture

382
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,750
and that idea is that um in sprint one

383
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:46,429
when you're working towards your first

384
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,379
unit of usable increment your first

385
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:51,230
piece of working software at the end of

386
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:54,830
sprint one you're going to probably

387
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,149
spend quite a lot of time on UX just as

388
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,919
you're gonna spend quite a lot of time

389
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:02,210
on architecture and quite a lot of time

390
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,639
on infrastructure so the amount of value

391
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,389
that you deliver in early Sprint's is

392
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:10,879
probably going to be quite small

393
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,950
maybe during the sprint you spend during

394
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,410
your first two weeks print you and the

395
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:21,510
whole team spend four days

396
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:23,940
working on UX how are we going to build

397
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,500
this what value we get or what user

398
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,630
behaviors we'll be trying to change and

399
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,300
that sets you up for the next couple of

400
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,660
Sprint's where you spend most of your

401
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,450
time in that delivery with a little bit

402
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,340
of discovery before you need to jump

403
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:43,950
back to food you're spending a lot more

404
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,810
time on discovery so that idea of team

405
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,780
accountability we're all working

406
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,510
together we are all as a team

407
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:55,290
accountable for users getting the best

408
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,090
experience they can and I think that's

409
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,890
really important focus on those

410
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,990
behaviors that you want to change in

411
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,460
users and it will help you focus your

412
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,440
product backlog as well working with

413
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,830
your product owner while the product

414
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,190
owner is accountable for value delivery

415
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,560
the entire scrum team is responsible and

416
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,690
we are all in it together and if the

417
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,470
product owner is not successful we're

418
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,690
just as much out of a job as they are so

419
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,290
I think that it's important that we all

420
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,900
work together to solve those problems

421
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:32,100
hopefully that was our youthful at quick

422
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,750
dive into those three things and I

423
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,920
talked a little bit about remote working

424
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,260
and about take taking some time for

425
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,180
engineering excellence team building

426
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,030
doing doing some things around that and

427
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:49,320
I talked a little bit about integrating

428
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:53,580
UX into your overall strategy I hope you

429
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,280
found this useful remember the values

430
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,080
and principles of scrum those ideas of

431
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,160
transparency so we can get those

432
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,350
feedback loops is built upon trust and

433
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,710
in order to get trust the scrum

434
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:11,280
community feels the commitment courage

435
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,890
focus respect and openness or of utmost

436
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,330
importance so if you're trying to make a

437
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,100
decision about how you're going to do

438
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:22,050
something especially during this crisis

439
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:24,390
think about how and how will the way

440
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,580
we've decided to do something support

441
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,070
those values the

442
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,049
kick those values to the Carib or are

443
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,580
they going to add to those values and

444
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:38,340
help us create more trust build

445
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,679
transparency and create feedback loops

446
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,039
if you want to get in touch with me you

447
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,570
have any additional questions please

448
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,450
please do there's my email address my

449
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:51,510
whatsapp and my Twitter you can get in

450
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,799
touch me on all of those places and I've

451
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,299
done two presentations recently that I

452
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,919
wanted to call out one is an enterprise

453
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:07,080
evolution that shows that you can -

454
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,299
which is from the the Microsoft story

455
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,240
the story of how the azure DevOps team

456
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,809
of the TFS team went from delivering

457
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,220
every two years in a waterfall manner

458
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,230
towards delivering to production every

459
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,029
three weeks and the improvements that

460
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:25,440
they made they started back in 2012

461
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:27,480
delivering only 22 features to

462
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,860
production each year and now they're

463
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,230
delivering over 270 features to

464
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,610
production each year so it's a big

465
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,990
change with the same number of people

466
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,720
and it's about paying back your

467
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,610
technical debt getting better at working

468
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,470
together improving communication lines

469
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:50,159
and getting all of that sorted last week

470
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:54,630
I also did a presentation on detecting

471
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:58,049
agile BS which is from the Department of

472
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,630
Defense article of the same name the

473
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:03,649
white paper I would definitely recommend

474
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,419
going and reading detecting agile BS and

475
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:09,659
seeing what's going on there is fairly

476
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:12,899
awesome article well thank you very much

477
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,639
I hope you found that useful if

478
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:22,289
anybody's got any questions then please

479
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:24,360
let me know I don't see any questions

480
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,360
coming in yet that doesn't mean they're

481
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,700
not there it just means my tool might

482
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,399
not have been

483
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:37,740
very good pulling pulling them out I'm

484
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:38,639
just going to check and then if there's

485
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,639
no questions

486
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:47,760
that's folks want answered I might well

487
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:51,450
I don't see any questions so thank you

488
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:55,110
