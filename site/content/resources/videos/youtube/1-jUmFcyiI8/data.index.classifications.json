    "final_score": 42.0,
    "reasoning": "The content discusses modern software delivery practices, emphasizing deployment frequency, stable pipelines, data-driven feedback loops, and collaboration. While aligning with some agentic-enabling outcomes (automation, telemetry, continuous delivery), it never references agentic approaches, AI agents, or human-agent integration. The intent is best-practice improvement, not agentic delivery. There is moderate alignment on CI/CD, observability, and telemetry, but no agency, autonomy, or context-aware intelligence—a core requirement for the category. Audience is suitable (delivery managers, engineers), and the content is focused, but it only partially overlaps conceptually and circumstantially.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content aligns with enabling practices for Agentic Software Delivery (e.g., CI/CD, feedback), but lacks direct reference to autonomous agents, agency, or their integration; fit is partial and indirect.",
