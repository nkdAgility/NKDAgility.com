1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,120
deployment frequency can serve as a as a

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,200
leading indicator of your company's

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,559
ability to

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
reduce the time to

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:18,080
Market I think there's a lot of metrics

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,880
in that space that you probably want to

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,720
look at because it's pretty it's pretty

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,279
it's pretty

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,279
difficult like you could deploy really

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,840
frequently to a test environment and

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,879
that has no bearing on your ability to

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,200
to deploy to production right you're

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,160
deploying stuff to a test environment is

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
breaking all the time so that metric on

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,760
its

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,440
own is is not going to it's not going to

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,520
just tell you that you're going to be

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,719
awesome right that's absolutely not true

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,120
there are a number of things that you

20
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,079
can look at but your ability to deploy

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,640
to an environment and the speed with

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,399
which you can deploy to an environment

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,440
and let's assume that that environment

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,400
is stable is stable so measure that as

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
well right the stability of that that

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,479
environment that that would be a a

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,799
reasonable indication if we had a stable

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,680
environment we're continuously

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,439
delivering to that we should be able to

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,759
get stuff into production right deliver

31
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,079
it to the market much more quickly very

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,759
quickly right but then you need to look

33
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,520
at what gets in the way I I I have

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,119
there's a little formula that I think it

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,159
works really well I've seen it work

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,399
organizations I know it's not my formula

37
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,360
it's it's I think it's a fairly logical

38
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,439
thing but look look at your entire uh

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,079
pipeline from ideation coming up with

40
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,600
ideas to go into your

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,880
product all the way through to getting

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
in front of your your customers and

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,119
closing the feedback loop right so

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
you're you're collecting data and

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,079
Telemetry on how that feature is used

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,320
being used how performant it is those

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,560
kind of things and then having it

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,280
feedbacks so that that whole Loop is

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,560
your time to learn right and that

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,120
is your your I'm not going to say it's

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,319
the only not your largest might it's the

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,160
largest one I'm going to talk about just

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,080
now your largest feedback loop right but

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,400
that has lots of little things that

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,200
happen in between so if you look at your

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,400
time to learn and figure out how long it

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,920
takes you can find the thing in that

58
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,680
time to learn that is taking the long

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,760
longest amount of time and go tackle

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,920
that go make it shorter go fix it and

61
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,000
then once you've fixed that thing right

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,760
you've collapsed it into something much

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,280
faster much sleeker look for what what's

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,239
the next the next Blocker in your in

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,560
your in getting your time to learn down

66
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,959
to a a manageable size but the question

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,239
then begs the question what is a

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,480
manageable size of of of time to learn

69
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,920
and as any quantity question as much as

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,920
you need and no

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,640
more making those

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,239
things faster than you need might have

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,720
an additional

74
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,599
cost so maybe focus on how quickly do

75
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,879
you need to be able to get things into

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,159
production how quickly do you need that

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,640
to maintain the existing customers how

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,760
do you fast do you need to be able to do

79
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
that to M to to get new customers right

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,480
because your your potentially your sales

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,360
team is going to be promising things to

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,040
customers and then you have to come back

83
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,159
around and and build them and because

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,120
they've been promised there's an

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,159
expectation don't have train your sales

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,519
team not to promise stuff but there

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,319
might be an expectation and if there's

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
an expectation of a feature then you

89
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,439
need to ship something within that

90
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,040
context as quickly as possible Right to

91
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,439
start building on that expectation

92
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,920
building trust otherwise you start

93
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,760
eroding trust because there's an

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,879
expectation that's not not fulfilled so

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
this is this is one of the quandaries of

96
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,000
the the delivery manager how fast we

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,560
need to go and there's definitely a

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,439
school of thought that faster is better

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,079
right even if your business doesn't need

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,439
or isn't demanding to be able to change

101
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,560
faster to be able to do things faster if

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,320
we're able if we in

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,400
Engineering in building the product are

104
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,479
able to shorten those feedback loops as

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,360
much as possible we can iterate on it we

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,759
can use that data we can get little

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
changes in front of real customers as

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,400
quickly as possible and then we can

109
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,720
monitor the Telemetry we can see how

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,720
we've impacted performance we can see

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
Live error messages coming through or or

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,639
or live Telemetry live performance live

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,120
eror messages and then be able to do

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,080
something about it and make little

115
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,360
little tweaks to get things right um and

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,639
I think that's the important thing when

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,199
when the outcomes that we're trying to

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,280
achieve are so complex right not

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,360
only how we achieve the outcome there's

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,479
a lot of

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,960
unknowns what the outcome's going to be

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,800
there's a lot of

123
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,919
unknowns and what we're going to

124
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,080
discover along the way there's a lot of

125
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,039
unknowns there's so many unknowns if we

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,759
get that loop as tight as possible we

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,960
can deal with surprises right when

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
something goes wrong we can deal with it

129
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,479
we can make a change we can ship it we

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
can make a change we can ship it that

131
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,039
didn't work we can make another change

132
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,919
and ship it right we can we can iterate

133
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,400
on that and when the business comes

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,199
along with an opportunity which they

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,400
invariably will right they're going to

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,000
come along and say this massive

137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,479
opportunities come along and they're not

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,240
going to say it like that right they're

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,039
like oh my God I need this feature I

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
need it right now it need I need to ship

141
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,800
it tomorrow

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,039
right if you are shipping once every

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,199
Sprint shipping once every two or 3

144
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,280
weeks that's not an impossible task to

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,199
add something and ship it within a few

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,360
days but it's going to be fraught with

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,680
risk and danger right risk and danger

148
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,000
because if you're doing something that

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,840
you've not done before and you have to

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,599
get it out quicker than you're used to

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,199
doing it before there's lots of points

152
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,960
failure in that

153
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,639
story if you as a as an engineering team

154
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,599
if you're a delivery manager and you

155
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,880
have a team or a bunch of teams a

156
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,639
product or a bunch of products if

157
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,560
they're able to continuously ship to

158
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,960
production so they're doing continuous

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,919
delivery to to real

160
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,080
users

161
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,080
then this opportunity comes along we add

162
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,639
some capability it ships we add some

163
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,240
capability at ships we build on that

164
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,000
capability at ships we get that much

165
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,440
tighter iterative cycle and if that

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,919
feature is this big how much of this

167
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,800
feature is required in order for sales

168
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,960
of the business to advertise start

169
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,639
advertizing that that that feature start

170
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,560
leveraging that feature in the in the

171
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,960
market right maybe you only need a very

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,240
small amount maybe you can do a couple

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,599
of days of work and ship it and then

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,080
that feature is there and they can start

175
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,680
adverti marketing it getting value from

176
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
it and then you're building on that as

177
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,000
users start using it and you see how

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,360
they're using it you can focus on what

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,960
it is you you you need as you go so

180
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,120
so this confluence I think

181
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,319
of product

182
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,680
development and delivery of that product

183
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,680
is absolutely critical in order

184
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,479
for us to maximize the value that the

185
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,680
business gets that that the business

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,639
creates um and in order to do that we

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,840
have to have we there has to be extreme

188
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,720
trust not only between us and the

189
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,800
business but between us and the customer

190
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
and it's not the business and the

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,879
customer it's us and the customer

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,400
because the customer knows that the

193
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,879
business doesn't ship the product they

194
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,720
know that we ship the product right

195
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,520
engineering ships the product so when

196
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,319
it's not the right thing they're blaming

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,120
the business when it's poor quality

198
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
they're complaining to the business that

199
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,759
we suck right that's that's pretty much

200
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,199
what happens so if we can get rid of

201
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,039
that problem then the only problem is

202
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,039
what are we going to go build and if

203
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:33,519
we're in we're in a position engineering

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,640
is in a position to help provide all of

205
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,360
the data for the business to be able to

206
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,240
make a determination on on what it is

207
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,479
they build and what they don't and

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,680
that's our job that's pretty much our

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,959
job we need to help the business make

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,360
those decisions and give them as much

211
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,279
information as they need in order to

212
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,839
make those decisions effectively and

213
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,279
that means collecting Telemetry that

214
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,000
means being able to continuously ship to

215
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,720
production that means en enabling the

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,480
ability that when a opportunity for the

217
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,399
business arises that we are able to

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,399
deliver on that opportunity faster than

219
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,399
our competitors
