1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,680
so one of one of the key practices that

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,840
I think is hugely valuable for for

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,679
organizations if they're moving towards

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
that more frequent delivery if they're

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,719
starting to get things in front of

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,600
customers as quickly as possible Right

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
you want to if you want to be able to do

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,920
be doing continuous

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,039
delivery you're going to

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,359
accept that you're going to be deploying

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,279
features new features to

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,640
production that you're not you're not

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,120
you're might be the product manager or

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,239
you might be the developers that you're

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,600
not ready for customers to use yet right

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,000
you might need you might have a feature

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
that takes multiple deployments to get

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,199
to the point where you're happy to be

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,800
able to to to have more more have it in

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:54,000
production right even if it's the end of

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,480
the feature is much further down the

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,760
line you've got 10% you want to do

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,760
before um you want

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,479
the majority of users to be accessing it

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,680
but you're going to be delivering 1% at

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,439
a time right just as a as a random

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,439
example a great example of uh

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,439
this again the Azure devops team do a

29
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:21,320
great job of this you can go open up

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,479
dev. your.com and when you're logged in

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,600
you'll see that there's a button in the

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,079
top right with a a picture of you or a

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,000
blank but picture of you you click on

34
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,680
that and it'll have a preview features

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,320
option and when when you click that it

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,640
will list all of the feature flags that

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,479
are available okay so what what they

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
effectively

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:47,280
do is they they write all of if they're

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,119
writing an update to an existing feature

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,320
that's in production it's just going to

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,000
go unless they're replacing a whole

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
feature like they did recently with as

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
your boards they had old boards and new

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
boards they wanted they were doing a big

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
update and they had a feature flag for

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,159
that right

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
typically if you're adding functionality

49
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,600
to an existing feature you're probably

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
just shipping it right because it's a

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,360
smaller change but if you're adding a

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,200
net new functionality to your product a

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,560
new feature a new capability a new

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,200
different thing then they hide it behind

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,760
a feature flag feature Flags the feature

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,200
flag would then be turned on in their

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,519
environment they have a the developers

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,640
themselves environment in their

59
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,400
environment for testing would be for

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,599
their once they're happy with their

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
testing they're going to turn it on for

62
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,920
the product group right so the

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
environment that they're working in

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,800
their account has that new feature and

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,400
they're going to be looking at the

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,040
Telemetry the developers that built the

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,080
feature are going to be looking at the

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,519
Telemetry so it's off for 99% of all the

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,959
users in the system it's on Just for

70
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,760
their own engineering team and then

71
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,680
they're looking at the Telemetry is this

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,000
performing is it doing the right thing

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,280
is it causing a lot of exceptions

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,519
they're looking at all of that data once

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,280
they're happy that that's uh good they

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,159
maybe open that up to everybody within

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,360
within Microsoft that's opted in to to

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,799
to see those things so then everybody

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
inside of Microsoft can turn on that

80
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,599
feature and can turn off that feature

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,959
the feature flag's visible if you turn

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,400
off a feature flag it asks you why

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,159
you're turning it off and if it's okay

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,040
to contact you very prudent I always

85
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,200
give a message and I always tick the Box

86
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,200
to say it's okay to contact me and I do

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,680
get contact from those teams because

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,879
they're interested in like why are you

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,319
turning it off oh you've said why it is

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,040
but I don't quite understand what you

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,159
mean and then they'll contact you and

92
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,640
try and figure it

93
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,200
out what's missing right what's missing

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,879
that you need is there a expectations

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Gap is there a it's bad right it's not

96
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,799
what I need is it causing errors and

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,560
Performing badly on my machine right

98
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,040
those are all could be reasons why I

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,319
want to turn it off but at some point

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,040
they're going to want to open it out to

101
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,519
a wider audience more people in the

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,280
world so what they typically do is they

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,160
publish a blog post on their their team

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,680
aure devops blog that says here's a new

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,160
feature we're working on we're looking

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,440
for people to help us kick the tires and

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,800
kick the tires is just a euphemism for

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
try it out and see see if it

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,039
works and they give an email address for

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
you to email with your account account

111
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,120
and they'll enable it for your account

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
then on your account you'll get that

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
feature flag and you can it will be off

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
by default and you can go turn it on

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
again they're looking for people turning

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,440
it off and feedback they're looking for

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Telemetry of people leaving it on is it

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,400
performing well that's their private

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,520
preview so you have to explicitly opt in

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,800
to that capability and that means that

121
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,160
you're limiting your audience right they

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,680
they'll they have an idea they'll be

123
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,240
able to look across all of the times

124
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,440
they've done this and have an idea how

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,520
many people they're going to get

126
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,280
with that number of people they're then

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,680
monitoring the Telemetry and looking at

128
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,800
do we have enough people using it is it

129
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,520
because they might have to do another

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,479
blog post right or another way to get

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,000
people in and do we have enough people

132
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,840
using it do does the Telemetry look good

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,800
is this viable for the next stage so the

134
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,560
next stage after that might be a public

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,400
preview and a public preview is that

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,479
switch that feature flag then becomes

137
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,680
visible to everybody on the service and

138
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,680
they put it out in a blog post saying

139
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,000
this is now available to everybody we'd

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,759
like you to try and kick the tires so

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,039
people that want to then go switch it on

142
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,840
it's now easy they don't have to email

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,840
it's just there they can go turn it on

144
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,600
and see what it's like some people just

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,720
Discover It other people they're reading

146
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,440
the blogs and and they find it and again

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,319
they're looking at Telemetry do we have

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,960
enough people using it do we need to

149
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,840
promote it again do users care do they

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,120
use this feature is it performing well

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,199
all of that type of data they're looking

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
at on whether whether they need to

153
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,080
invest more in that feature whether

154
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,400
anybody cares about that feature whether

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,759
they just need to stop right or so it's

156
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,680
it's

157
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:16,759
pivot H uh anti up or call right that's

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,919
your your the poker analogy right you're

159
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,000
you're is this feature

160
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,680
viable if they get enough Telemetry and

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,039
everything looks good the next stage is

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,759
they turn on the feature for everybody

163
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,599
on the server but they leave that

164
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,479
feature flag to be able to turn it off

165
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,080
so they're interested in that feedback

166
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,960
who's turning it off why are they

167
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,759
turning it off can we have a chat with

168
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,680
them and find out what's missing what do

169
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,960
they need right you're engaging with

170
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,240
your customers this is the development

171
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,759
team the engineering team that built

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,000
that functionality is continuously

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,680
engaging with with real real customers

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,400
in production either through Telemetry

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,919
or actually talking to them because you

176
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,319
want to find out what's going on I I've

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,280
turned off a Fe before cuz I didn't like

178
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,560
it and said I didn't like it this is bad

179
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,720
it's not working for me take the box hit

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,759
submit and a couple of days later I've

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,919
got a a a communication from the product

182
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,919
manager for that feature the person

183
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,360
who's moning that feature and bringing

184
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,599
it through to basically ask what's it

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,400
need what's missing why' you not like it

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,080
all useful and do we need to make keep

187
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,360
continue to make changes to it before it

188
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,440
goes goes live so at any point in that

189
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,960
story you can pull that feature you can

190
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,120
just disappear that feature flag and

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,680
it's gone for everybody because it's

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
performing badly because and you can

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,000
automate that as well so you could have

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,000
automation that checks for performance

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,080
and then automatically let's get rid of

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,599
that feature if it if it's impacting the

197
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
system right that should be it should be

198
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,639
just built into the

199
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,400
system and then once everybody's got it

200
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,759
turned on people aren't turning it off

201
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
there's probably a few lards there's

202
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,879
probably a few unhappy people when you

203
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
change things right you move their

204
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,960
cheese that's just the cost of doing

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,599
business but everything's generally

206
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,360
okay then feature flags on for everybody

207
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,840
you start removing that feature flag

208
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,400
from the system and that features just

209
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,080
in production so that could be a very

210
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,479
long time I know that when the Azure

211
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,879
devops team did their boards the new

212
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,960
boards old boards it took them nearly

213
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,360
two and a half years nearly three years

214
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,800
to get everybody over to the new

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,599
boards because they kept hitting missing

216
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,479
functionality they kept hitting some

217
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,680
performance problems and then they had

218
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,279
to kind of old boards rewrite that new

219
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,159
boards again and it took them a long

220
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,640
time to to to to get

221
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,920
from where we need to replace the boards

222
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,320
to it's done it was a very long time and

223
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,480
so feature flags and how you enable

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
feature Flags so they can be behind the

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,800
scenes they can be something that you

226
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,959
give actual users access

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,519
to these this is one of the the core

228
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,959
practices that enable you to do

229
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,360
continuous delivery to production while

230
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,240
protecting your system protecting your

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,120
users and enabling you to get the

232
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,640
Telemetry you need to understand whether

233
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,079
you've built the right thing in

234
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,079
production
