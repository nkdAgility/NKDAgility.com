    "reasoning": "The content provides a comprehensive discussion on the relationship between product ownership and product management within Scrum, emphasizing the importance of value delivery, alignment with strategic goals, and adaptation to changing markets. However, there is no explicit reference or meaningful exploration of Objective Key Results (OKRs), John Doerr’s framework, or any of the OKR 'four superpowers.' Concepts such as outcome-orientation and strategic alignment are mentioned, but not in the specific context or mechanics of OKRs. The depth and intent center on clarifying Scrum roles rather than providing substantive discussion or implementation guidance on OKRs. The audience overlaps somewhat with the OKR category, but the focus remains organizational product responsibility, not structured outcome frameworks.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on clarifying the connection between product ownership and product management within Scrum, emphasizing value and alignment. It does not discuss OKRs, their framework, or implementation, making its relevance to the Objective Key Results category minimal.",

    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses the evolution and interaction between product ownership and product management in the context of Scrum, focusing on value delivery, adaptation, and role clarity. However, there are no direct mentions or conceptual use of Agentic Engineering or its key themes such as maximizing agency, systemic observability, DevOps, or AI collaboration. While adaptation and empowerment are emphasized, the discussion lacks explicit engagement with topics like engineering practices that maximize human and AI agency, ethical AI, or feedback-driven adaptation through technical means. The target audience and focus on iterative value delivery slightly align at the periphery, but the content’s intent and depth are firmly rooted in Agile product roles, not Agentic Engineering.",

It does not discuss agentic engineering principles, technical frameworks, or human/AI agency, making its relevance to the Agentic Engineering category minimal.",

There are no mentions of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic systems, which are central to Agentic Software Delivery. The audience is practitioners in agile software delivery, but the piece lacks any discussion of agentic technologies, agency, or AI-human integration. All alignment is indirect, resulting in a very low confidence score for this category. No penalties were needed as tone and recency were appropriate.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about product ownership and product management in Scrum—fully aligned to agile, but has no mention of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or agentic concepts. Fit is extremely weak and based only on general relevance to delivery topics.",
