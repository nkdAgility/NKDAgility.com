1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,200
so

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:07,520
effective product

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,679
ownership focuses on product management

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,799
there's a kind of

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,000
misconception that we're in some way

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,760
replacing product management with

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,880
product ownership or that they're

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,800
different things right um they're

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,320
absolutely not they're exactly the same

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,800
thing uh so this this is

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,079
where product ownership

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
within the context of scrum right

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,719
because I I definitely want to

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,120
disambiguate between um when I'm talking

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,800
about the product owner I'm talking

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,360
about the product owner as defined

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,879
within the context of scrum and the

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,600
scrum guides not the job title or role

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,280
that your organization has created and

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,320
added other baggage that is nothing to

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,079
do with those things right so you might

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,439
have a product owner within your

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,320
organization and it says in the job

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,640
description also responsible for writing

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,680
reports for management also responsible

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,799
for managing the product the pro the

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
project right or other stuff that is not

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,280
what what what I'm talking

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,560
about the product

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,640
owner is an accountability within the

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,640
context of scrum that's it it defines

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,880
that the product owner

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,320
needs to be somebody that

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,960
exists that the organization

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,960
respects and that is

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,719
accountable for the maximization of

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,680
value delivered from the work of the

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,719
scrum

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,799
team that's the product

40
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,200
owner the product owner their job

41
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,159
title is not product

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,719
owner that's a that's a madeup

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,439
organizational misunderstanding of

44
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,240
moving towards scrum right there's no

45
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,640
such thing as a you shouldn't have job

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,640
titles in your organization that are

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,239
product own or score Master right that

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,160
should exist

49
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,000
um you're in product management right if

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,480
we take product management as a as a big

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,680
rapper of all of the things that need to

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,239
be done in order to manage a

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,560
product

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,080
we're shifting

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,640
the focus of that from a longterm maybe

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
we do a two-yearly delivery cycle right

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,159
towards a very short delivery

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,280
cycle and if we're doing scrum if we're

59
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,080
doing scrum there's some

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,400
accountabilities that scrum brings for

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,400
those people that are doing product

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
management

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,680
um

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
so one could

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,920
say that the product

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,799
owner is an aspect of existing product

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,159
management that probably should always

68
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,319
have been there in the first place but

69
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,159
maybe wasn't necessarily

70
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,660
Quantified enough to make it a viable

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,239
thing and

72
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,200
[Music]

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,040
in the past organizations have been able

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,760
to skate

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,760
by without having that

76
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,439
Clear Vision goal and value Focus

77
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,799
organizations were able to to to to

78
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:45,959
skate by perhaps they had um um deep

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,879
coffers built up from some product that

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,280
didn't have any competitors that they

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,599
they they made and now we have lots of

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,159
money so it actually you know we don't

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,159
need to maximize we just need to get by

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,319
um or for other reasons right but as we

85
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,879
move to towards that shorter iterative

86
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,840
cycle it becomes more important to focus

87
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,959
on value and less important to focus on

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,760
more

89
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,320
stuff right we're not maximizing

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,320
productivity we're not maximizing the

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,400
number of items we deliver per time

92
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,960
frame um

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,440
because oh we can't okay we kind of are

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,199
but we're not trying to deliver more

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,560
stuff we're trying to deliver more

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,280
valuable stuff and in order to deliver

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,759
more valuable stuff rather than just

98
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,680
more stuff we need to understand what

99
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,880
value is and in order to understand what

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,039
value is need to understand what

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,880
direction the organization's going and

102
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:49,360
that's the foundation of product

103
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,039
management and product ownership is an

104
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
accountability in

105
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,680
scrum I think I think I've said this

106
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,919
before scrums like a

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,240
mirror right the mirror just reflects

108
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,560
what you're doing

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,360
and says why why can't you do this thing

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,759
that we think you should

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,720
need so the accountability of the

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,160
product owner being maximizing the value

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,080
of the work done by the scrum team why

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,720
can't you do that what's inhibiting your

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,680
ability to do that that's why the

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
product owner accountability exists it's

117
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,840
not a job title it's not a job role it's

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,360
an

119
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,039
accountability that

120
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,840
forces product management to reflect

121
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,400
on why they can't manage the

122
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,120
product in this new context right CU

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,919
because we're we're we're moving from

124
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,000
those long-term deliveries towards

125
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
shorter and shorter deliveries for all

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,039
products across all Industries and part

127
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,919
of the reason for that is we want to

128
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,520
take advantage of opportunities in the

129
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,960
market and we want to deal with

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,759
surprises that come from the market

131
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,759
right our environment or our

132
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
business um and in order to take

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,160
advantage of them we need to take

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
advantage of them more quickly than a

135
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,000
competitor can come along and take

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
advantage of them or a new business can

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,120
start up and take advantage of them

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,319
otherwise we're too late to the party so

139
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,120
in order to do that we need to move

140
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,360
faster what is the amount of time that

141
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,680
your business

142
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,360
needs to go around that cycle of

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,919
re-evaluating what we're doing that's

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,919
the cycle you need to be on how quickly

145
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,400
does your Market change most of us don't

146
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,160
exist in static markets right we exist

147
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,400
in volatile markets that are always

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,319
changing the the niches that our

149
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,639
organization has grown to fit um growing

150
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,039
contract on a regular basis if they're

151
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,280
growing and Contracting on a regular

152
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,440
basis and you're in one Niche um you're

153
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,199
going to feel that pain on a on on that

154
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,960
on that cycle right that's something

155
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,319
that sometimes my business suffers from

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:57,120
where you've you've got that cycle of of

157
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,280
of uh organizations having

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,280
um having having their flesh with cash

159
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,520
so they're looking to to train people

160
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,680
and increase skills so our training

161
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:12,080
business goes up um and then you have an

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,199
economic downturn um and our training

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,520
business drops right that's that's the

164
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,639
ebb and flow of any one business so how

165
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,680
do you mitigate that well you need to be

166
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,360
as a product owner product manager you

167
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,440
need to be thinking about how do we open

168
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,599
out new markets so all of the es and

169
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,560
flows of those those different markets

170
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:36,000
operate on different Cycles so that we

171
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,479
have maintain our ability to operate as

172
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,599
a business without loss um by divesting

173
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,280
our our interests into lots of different

174
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,000
areas um and product management at a big

175
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,199
organizational level is thinking about

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,840
how do we get into new markets how do we

177
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,479
get those new stories in and the product

178
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,360
owner just said product owner

179
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
accountability is just to maximize the

180
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,879
value of the work done by the team so if

181
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
we're going to have a bunch of team we

182
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,159
should maximize the value of the work

183
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,919
that they're actually doing and in doing

184
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,159
that maximizing the value return on

185
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,360
investment that we get from the work

186
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,879
that we do we should be able to adapt to

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
those changing needs in the market do

188
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,680
the product management thing uh and

189
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,720
that's product management includes

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,440
portfolio that's part of it right scrum

191
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,159
is part of it because it's managing the

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,319
work done by the scrum team right that's

193
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,880
part of that story creating little um

194
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,959
social technology uh that allows you to

195
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,760
manage that but it's within that wider

196
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:43,680
context so the idea is that um we have a

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,600
holistic approach to product management

198
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,760
of

199
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,640
which the product owner is just an

200
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,680
accountability a part of that story we

201
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,360
need to create a a shared understanding

202
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,200
with vision goals and value for the

203
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,720
direction that we're going so that all

204
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,680
of these self-organizing teams can work

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,959
together towards that common goal right

206
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,440
that's how we achieve that common common

207
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,680
goal um and we're using shorter

208
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,839
iterations particularly scrum in this

209
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,000
context if we're talking about the

210
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,640
product owner um for frequent product

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
validation through inspection and

212
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,399
adaption right scrum is founded on

213
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,279
empiricism we need to have regular tests

214
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,560
to validate our hypothesis that a

215
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:37,160
feature is going to advance value and

216
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:39,640
that is why saying that product

217
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,040
ownership um how does product ownership

218
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,000
build on the foundation of agile product

219
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:50,320
management is is kind of like the the

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,920
reverse of the story it's actually how

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,600
does product ownership enable product

222
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,240
management to maximize the value that

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,240
we're trying to create
