Dipping without telemetry is flying blind. If you ship and you can't see what's happening, you don't know if it's working, you don't know if it's broken, and you don't even know if anybody's using it. No logs, no metrics, no real feedback.

At Naked Agility we help teams make telemetry part of Done, not an afterthought, not a nice to have, a core requirement.

Every increment you ship should gather real data: usage, performance, behaviour, so you can validate outcomes, spot problems fast, and make better decisions. Because until you're gathering telemetry, you're not learning. And if you're not learning, you're not delivering real value.

Ready to stop flying blind after you ship? Let's make telemetry part of your definition of done.
