Every increment you ship should gather

real data usage performance behavior so

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,079
you can validate outcomes spot problems

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,160
fast and make better decisions Because

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
until you're gathering telemetry you're

not learning And if you're not learning

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,239
you're not delivering real value Ready
