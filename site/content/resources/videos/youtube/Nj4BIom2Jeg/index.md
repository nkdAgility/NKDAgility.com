There’s a phrase I keep coming back to: shipping without telemetry is flying blind. It’s astonishing how often I see teams pour their energy into building and releasing features, only to have no idea what happens next. Did it work? Did it break? Is anyone even using it? Without logs, metrics, or any meaningful feedback, you’re left guessing. And guessing is not a strategy.

At Naked Agility, we’ve made it our mission to help teams embed telemetry into their very definition of Done. Not as an afterthought. Not as a “nice to have.” Telemetry is a core requirement—an essential ingredient for any team that wants to deliver real value, not just working software.

Why Telemetry Matters

Let’s be clear: every increment you ship should be gathering real data. I’m talking about:

- **Usage**: Who’s using your feature? How often? Are they getting stuck?
- **Performance**: Is it fast enough? Are there bottlenecks or slowdowns?
- **Behaviour**: Are users interacting as you expected, or are they finding creative new ways to break things?

Without this feedback loop, you’re not learning. And if you’re not learning, you’re not improving. You’re certainly not delivering value in any meaningful sense. You’re just ticking boxes and hoping for the best.

My Experience: Telemetry as a Game Changer

I’ve seen first-hand the difference it makes when teams treat telemetry as a first-class citizen. The teams that thrive are the ones who:

- Bake telemetry into every release, no exceptions.
- Use real data to validate outcomes, not just opinions or gut feelings.
- Spot problems early—sometimes before users even notice.
- Make informed decisions about what to build next, based on evidence, not assumptions.

Contrast that with teams who ship and hope. They’re the ones who get blindsided by outages, who can’t answer basic questions about usage, and who struggle to justify their next move. It’s not a place you want to be.

Making Telemetry Part of Done

So, how do you make telemetry part of your Definition of Done? Here’s what I recommend:

1. **Define Telemetry Requirements Upfront**  
   Before you write a line of code, ask: what do we need to know after this ships? What questions should our telemetry answer?

2. **Automate Data Collection**  
   Manual logging is a recipe for inconsistency. Invest in tools and practices that make telemetry automatic and reliable.

3. **Review Telemetry as Part of Every Increment**  
   Don’t wait for a crisis. Make reviewing telemetry a regular part of your process—every sprint, every release.

4. **Act on What You Learn**  
   Telemetry is only valuable if you use it. Build a culture where data drives decisions, not just hunches.

The Bottom Line

If you’re not gathering telemetry, you’re not learning. And if you’re not learning, you’re not delivering real value. It’s as simple—and as challenging—as that.

So, are you ready to stop flying blind after you ship? Let’s make telemetry a non-negotiable part of your Definition of Done. Your users, your team, and your future self will thank you.
