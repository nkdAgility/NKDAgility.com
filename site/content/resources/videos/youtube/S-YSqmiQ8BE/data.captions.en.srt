1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,680
modern legacy systems don't mean

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,720
breaking what works but striking a

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,000
balance That's where things get tricky

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,759
On one side there's the risk of

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,920
innovation disrupting stable systems

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
introducing technical debt increasing

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,279
operational complexity On the other the

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,760
cost of stagnation getting stuck with

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,680
outdated processes slow delivery and

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,920
losing ground to more agile competitors

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
Most organizations struggle with this

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
Either they move too fast and create

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,040
chaos or they move too slow and get left

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
behind But the reality is you don't have

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,239
to choose between stability and progress

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,280
You can have both if you modernize in

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,840
the right way At Naked Agility we don't

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,039
come in and fix your systems We work

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,680
with you to help you understand We help

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,840
you see where your systems work your

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,079
processes your engineering practices are

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,760
enabling you and where they're holding

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,920
you back And from there we help you make

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,119
better decisions non-disruptive gradual

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,400
modernization incremental improvements

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,720
that build resilience not work

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
Engineering advice on maintability

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,159
testability and supportability All

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,320
things that make modern systems

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,479
sustainable in the long run Because real

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,720
innovation isn't just about moving fast

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,560
It's about moving forward without

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,840
breaking the things that keep you

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,240
running Want to figure out how to do

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
that in your organization Let's have a

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
conversation
