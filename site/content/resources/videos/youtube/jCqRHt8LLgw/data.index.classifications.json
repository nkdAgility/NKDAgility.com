It exclusively focuses on team operational practices, estimation, agile team composition, and architectural adaptability, none of which are explicitly linked to OKR. The alignment and depth scores are set minimally above zero to signal minor conceptual overlap with certain agile values (continuous improvement, adaptability), but without explicit reference to OKRs.
