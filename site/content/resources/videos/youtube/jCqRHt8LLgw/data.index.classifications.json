Depth is moderate when discussing the rationale behind changing estimation or team size, but the author rarely connects these shifts explicitly to high-level organizational goals or true strategic alignment. The audience appears to be agile practitioners and leads, some of whom may be responsible for strategic adaptations, but the content focuses more on effective process tweaks rather than broad strategic planning. The signal is mostly focused on evolving practice, with some attention to stakeholder alignment (in the emergent architecture section), but is generally operational rather than strategic. Overall, while there are a few threads that brush up against strategy—like explaining selling change to stakeholders—most of the text doesn't address high-level, organization-wide planning or vision. Thus, the confidence is moderate-low.",
