office hours is where I answer any

14
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:08,159
questions that I'd asked Baris is going

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,090
to be moving from Tuesday's to

here to go to forum where you can ask

19
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,759
anything

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:33,990
this is somewhere where

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,930
I nobody knows who you are and what you

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,320
said so don't put anything in the

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,460
content that

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,050
we don't but I have a few questions that

25
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,740
have come up over the last couple of

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:50,440
weeks and I just finished a professional

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:56,190
scrum master class for a program who to

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,190
cling in are we a regular class that I

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:12,660
and check for questions we are going to

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:17,180
talk about and story point evolution

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:22,410
I the conversation on Twitter with

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,040
somebody asked whether what I thought of

33
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,990
story points

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,880
I was buying to Daniel the counties

35
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:35,090
thanks that at story point have damaged

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,090
are

37
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:45,980
our industry over the last 20 years as

38
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:50,360
put it back amount but I replied and

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,430
said I I agree with Daniel um I used to

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,700
think that story points were awesome and

41
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,620
I don't so we'll chat about that and I

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,620
talked about team size because I think

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,490
the traditional six plus or minus three

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,490
is

45
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:17,330
as we get or our complex at building

46
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:20,720
software and I had a question in my

47
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:24,290
class around how to sell emergent

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,690
architecture decoders if you do want to

49
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:33,350
ask a question and you are on either

50
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:38,300
LinkedIn Facebook periscope or gup-a

51
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:42,970
please feel free ask the question in the

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,970
comments I should be able to

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,440
as they come in maybe a delay but be

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,950
able to see as they connect platforms

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,400
you can also go ask questions form and I

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,400
will ask

57
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:11,610
so I have just a quick update on the the

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,450
classes that will be running the Oslo

59
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,579
class has just finished they only have

60
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,070
one more class on my schedule I'm going

61
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,170
to update my shape

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,170
liked more

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,790
at

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,710
but I have a professional scrum unban

65
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,070
cool

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,070
annual Vacanti

67
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,460
aims on currently have a couple of

68
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,420
students registered and we are hoping to

69
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:51,590
have a lot of fun in that class as we

70
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:58,640
use a new technique to de live a virtual

71
00:04:51,590 --> 00:05:02,560
classroom and to eight experience Daniel

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,560
I found

73
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,470
eita analytics

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,000
or flow better and bring that in

75
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,999
part of this

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:24,150
old

77
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:31,580
ah so let me see

78
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:35,639
Oh first up is story point evolution

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:40,770
story points are they've had an

80
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:44,669
interesting life been around for quite a

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,260
long time and I think I agree with

82
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,500
Daniel Daniel candy said that they've

83
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,070
damaged our let me see if I can find

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,070
that tweet

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,770
and you'll

86
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,530
you

87
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,170
or we go as photos

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,770
you

89
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,770
but

90
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,199
this

91
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,199
you

92
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:28,939
oh I made me small

93
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,770
you

94
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:15,120
so the reason that I don't like story

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,200
points is they don't actually provide

96
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,700
value I'm sure Daniel would do a much

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,750
better job of describing the additional

98
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,570
value that you get then different

99
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,540
measures story points are something that

100
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,600
we've been trying to use in the agile

101
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,240
community for a long as they are

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:43,030
relative estimation

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:46,710
they don't have a have a em value

104
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,710
outside of the team because there

105
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,199
reflective of how the team

106
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,640
effort there's a bolt they are not

107
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,260
something that we prepare across teams

108
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,260
because each team come up with different

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,040
values they are not something that we

110
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:10,730
can measure that team by but they are

111
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,760
traditionally used by the development

112
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:17,000
team to understand based on their

113
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,230
history of point delivery like ah city

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,150
based on that and how many how many

115
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:28,650
things they might be able to bring into

116
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:31,229
their sprint and also at the

117
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,260
product owner looking at what's the

118
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:37,050
progression that acting with the back

119
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,979
lock problem the story points is that

120
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,450
they're their standard deviation of what

121
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,089
you think you're going to get what you

122
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,550
get and maybe that that em worst case

123
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,649
the best case that standard deviation is

124
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,750
so wide

125
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,600
or than 30%

126
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:01,480
the starvation is so wide the ability to

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,130
predict so 30% sprint own sprint a huge

128
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,110
difference

129
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,640
getting stuff and not getting stuff so

130
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:13,220
what can we do

131
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,920
stat well M as part of the PSK class you

132
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,980
can go download and read the Kanban

133
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,100
guide for scrum team we talk instead

134
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:27,290
about through report doesn't care about

135
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,030
size whereas velocity at story points

136
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,970
cares about the size of the item so

137
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:35,320
you're gonna sum up the story points

138
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,890
backlog all right in the spin backlog

139
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,690
paucity sorry Rupert and only cares

140
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,320
about the number of items per unit of

141
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:46,840
time so that unit of time could be print

142
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,090
sum how many things that I deliver one

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,160
of the advantages of that is if the team

144
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,350
want to game that ie they want to make

145
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,420
the numbers bigger to look better they

146
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,240
need to reduce the size of the items

147
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,059
size of the items is good get smaller

148
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,839
batches and actually

149
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:08,709
I process a lot more quickly but it also

150
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,919
allows us to look and instead if we

151
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:16,089
collect throughput so we calculate very

152
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:19,449
we know our throughput we go are at

153
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:24,669
cycle time from when we decided the work

154
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:29,619
has started to when we played ends at

155
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:32,829
collect our am working process how many

156
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:34,959
items currently have between by unions

157
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:38,300
and we'd work start even when it

158
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:45,230
finished no matter how many columns

159
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:49,190
an idea of how long things have in light

160
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,720
are those even you can have it bonds as

161
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,260
well you can break it out that way but

162
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,260
really

163
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,880
if we can model that we can use em

164
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,620
littles law

165
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,080
get an understanding of um if we reduce

166
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,500
our work in process that we could

167
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,850
potentially increase our cycle time and

168
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:19,110
if we want to deliver more things we

169
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,810
need actually smaller we can't tell any

170
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,930
of that just from

171
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:28,590
story points because they're not just

172
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:32,120
size dependent but an objective measure

173
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,120
rather than a subjective measure

174
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,490
so I started off at liking story points

175
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,920
and I then moved towards thinking 30

176
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,500
points make sense for immature teams

177
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,149
because they're easy to understand easy

178
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,490
to pick up quickly I get started with

179
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:59,010
but that the limitations of story points

180
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:02,010
I think cause more damage

181
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:07,050
at a time and I would rather a team

182
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:11,070
started they as possible being at at

183
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:15,269
their throughput liked in their cycle

184
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,670
time broke item aging and process if

185
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,470
they start that sooner rather than later

186
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,240
they get used to it a lot more quickly

187
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,940
they're able to look at the data and

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,080
maybe make better optimizations make

189
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,630
better decisions

190
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:36,730
from events as legal but that was my

191
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:38,920
thought process my journey towards that

192
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:43,440
story points are a bad idea and maybe

193
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,940
not as against them as Daniel is but I

194
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,200
definitely think there are a thing of

195
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,200
the thing of the past

196
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:57,470
rusty

197
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:01,790
Lord so the second one second question

198
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,850
was around team size and we talked a lot

199
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:09,060
in in scrum about team size and we have

200
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,500
our particular questions in the

201
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,790
[Music]

202
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,410
but particular questions in the scrum

203
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:21,790
training around

204
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:27,140
and a team be smaller than B yes it can

205
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:31,459
the scrum guide recommends it at team

206
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:34,370
at 3:00 and 9:00 but it doesn't say they

207
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,260
have to be the other question is usually

208
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,020
a

209
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,030
oh yeah first they can t be better than

210
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,550
19 teams can be way better than 9 is

211
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,620
that gonna be optimal are they going to

212
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,910
be able to dictate and understand what

213
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,220
everybody's working on and work together

214
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,750
effectively that might be a different

215
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,760
question in that space though um what

216
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,360
what I would like to discuss is I work

217
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,670
with a lot of team I worked for a long

218
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,670
time as a at Microsoft MVP

219
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,290
yes used to be a fast and I was EV UPS

220
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:13,230
I've been working with those along with

221
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,670
the other for a long time and their

222
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:21,270
teams are bigger ballet than at night

223
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,339
they have team and in 12 and the reason

224
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,270
they have teams between 10 and 12 is

225
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:30,029
because they're doing a lot more things

226
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:33,930
inside of the sprint or that they're

227
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:37,160
able both having high quality working

228
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,160
software in production Utley

229
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:48,010
something that they use is a state

230
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:51,380
reliability techniques but they have

231
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,690
engineers inside of the sprint and I

232
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,920
think if my understanding is correct it

233
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,250
might have changed since the last time

234
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,790
that I spoke to but and they have two

235
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,670
people at pair sprint allocated to the

236
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,860
website reliability

237
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,890
in each team there are two people

238
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,020
dealing with that so anytime they have

239
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,950
an outage they are the first responders

240
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,530
that outage not interrupting the team

241
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,170
working on adding value to the product

242
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,960
they may have to bring in other people

243
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:29,360
that are currently adding bout figure

244
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:32,160
that out there but they are your

245
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,730
hopefully not going to have an outage

246
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,920
if there is an outage the root cause

247
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,470
analysis this and the time they're there

248
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,959
they're dedicating up up spending that

249
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,899
time to pause analysis figure out all of

250
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,699
the things that might need to change in

251
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,019
order to make the product better some of

252
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,240
them may be small things some of them

253
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,360
may be big architectural change

254
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,140
get those things onto product backlog

255
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,760
and then as their day-to-day job when

256
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:05,080
they're not dealing Energon

257
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:08,710
their job is to work only those site

258
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,880
reliability tasks making your

259
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:17,800
application more stable efficient less

260
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:21,840
buggy and our architecture and I would

261
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,060
use an option that rule site reliability

262
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:28,480
engineering is rotated through the team

263
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,700
so that you don't have somebody just

264
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,360
through time as a specialist in that

265
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,720
role we need to get it running

266
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,720
X

267
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,110
option now they also give responsibility

268
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,460
to their team function obviously they've

269
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,890
got SR Easton so teams that build a

270
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,750
feature or responsible buying a feature

271
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,880
and doing and maintaining it in

272
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,530
production so they have to cite what

273
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,380
telemetry they're going to capture they

274
00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:00,200
have to look at that telemetry

275
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,310
everything's good partly there was that

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,579
there was SR ease

277
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:10,860
but it does leave the rest of the team

278
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:13,949
be the focus adding value and be

279
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,470
interrupted that means that the team

280
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,110
needs to be that little bit bigger -

281
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,180
bigger than you

282
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,570
from team

283
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,600
well but maybe 10 to 12 is an extra

284
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:30,180
person still than the name we generally

285
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,270
look at and the reason that they have

286
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,630
that extra at person is that they're

287
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:39,450
doing more stuff during print in a

288
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,810
traditional project market product cycle

289
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,940
and especially the old TFS product cycle

290
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,490
from the door they would have shipped to

291
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,570
production once a week Bruce and had a

292
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:54,590
service pack F we at so every year here

293
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:59,580
they have a service pack then I respect

294
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm in that model a lot of work got left

295
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:06,420
end cycle you have a code freeze and

296
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,630
they have to go and stabilize the code

297
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,420
and that's our Ollie and be my technical

298
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,700
debt fixing bugs that kind of thing but

299
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,100
there's also work to secure the product

300
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,160
to run security checks to run

301
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:26,200
performance benchmarks do all of that

302
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:28,990
work and now in modern techniques

303
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,610
that they are using they run all of

304
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:36,990
those things inside of the team

305
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:41,429
so they're not running them

306
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:44,429
they're not running them in our

307
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,880
secondary age I do the tea by a

308
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:51,809
different Department gives them feedback

309
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:55,260
Veltman tea elves making sure but good

310
00:18:51,809 --> 00:19:00,000
purity the automation around the

311
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,779
security that I knew done and even the

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,160
rest he could write exercises to get the

313
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,960
additional stuff the theme

314
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,510
so their teams are a little bit bigger

315
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,670
and I think that is an indication of

316
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,670
things to come from any team

317
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:23,100
that may be the traditional thing the

318
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:25,679
people about 5 to 6 from team

319
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,289
not going to be enough as we bring and

320
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,450
not not only have we got quarters and

321
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,060
testers

322
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,500
also bring in security experts and

323
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,870
operations and functions

324
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,990
metrics as we're bringing those things

325
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:45,279
that are national

326
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,279
Lilly understand

327
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,240
quality of the work that the Bing and

328
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,240
the act

329
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:58,530
half on production and on

330
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,300
and what ad looks like I am a trade to

331
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,900
know what broken something or whether

332
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,669
the varmints or whether are actually

333
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,429
using the feet

334
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,429
eight or all thing

335
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,870
I did be

336
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:19,720
all our tea

337
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,540
bigger and so

338
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,410
I want to see

339
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,750
bigger than elf that's that for me is

340
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,360
quite a quite a big team but I think

341
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,240
it's within the context of the

342
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,260
organization some organizations will be

343
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,580
all of those things talking about and

344
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,260
still have small teams other

345
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,260
organizations will have to add

346
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,440
so that was the the second one we talked

347
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:53,690
about at story points and moving towards

348
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:56,050
the the more and style metrics talked

349
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,050
about

350
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:06,160
so the other one that I had was a

351
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,410
emergent architecture I think I'm going

352
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,840
to be interested if I can have a decent

353
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,630
answer but this one the question was

354
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,460
around how do you sell marriage in

355
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,930
architecture to be cold

356
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,660
that idea that we're not going to know

357
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:26,330
up front it's a it's not possible for us

358
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,090
to know up front and there may be things

359
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,720
that we would have added to architecture

360
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,110
in a waterfall or terrific project

361
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,630
management model where we would have

362
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:42,190
made a bunch of decisions or features

363
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,770
that we actually build

364
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,700
I would be a yeast and to have our

365
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:51,840
architecture in urge over time maybe in

366
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,570
the first sprint wheel and fit I'm

367
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,840
adding value that's the time we're we're

368
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,570
working with architecture

369
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,899
are you bow you we cannot get speaker

370
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,899
name

371
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,110
time to do it I'll have at slack

372
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,419
arge amounts of new phone

373
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,899
but selling imagine architecture to

374
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,850
stakeholders the organization I think

375
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:29,020
this is this is something that's just a

376
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:33,429
change in a organizations

377
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:36,559
organized in order to facilitate

378
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:39,470
adjuvant practices I'm not talking about

379
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,919
just agile within buffer engineering

380
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:46,510
team rest of the organization in order

381
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,210
to take advantage but speed

382
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,830
both we're team and really that I mean

383
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,510
let's go back a bit because that's

384
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,150
that's not the point the hope the whole

385
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,120
point is that a business needs to be

386
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,570
able to take advantage of opportunity as

387
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,080
they arise in the market to be able to

388
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,840
see an opportunity go let's let's build

389
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,010
something around that take advantage of

390
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,690
that whether that's getting a new

391
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,140
product into the market whether that's

392
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,549
adding new features into the market ah

393
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,900
whatever that is if you look at the

394
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:24,040
current at covent crisis and the number

395
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:27,929
of the shift that organizations have

396
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,929
made in the fever's

397
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:37,280
or delivering especially in the space of

398
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:40,070
virtual pain so all the video

399
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,419
conferencing applications ramped up not

400
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,370
only their infrastructure but

401
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:47,150
potentially certain features Microsoft

402
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,610
have already started rolling out 3 by 3

403
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,410
instead of 2 by 2 windows they've

404
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,140
already started rolling out at hand

405
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:57,590
raised as an infant part of the product

406
00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:04,460
and other things end call was one of

407
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:06,860
them the the zoom add to pivot a from

408
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,870
adding new features towards adding

409
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,690
security and actually adding the

410
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:15,520
incorruption said was in the product

411
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:19,370
actually doing things very different

412
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,600
other than before the crisis happened

413
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:27,260
and even things like I use our platform

414
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,780
called Lord order to pour game is

415
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,350
remotely

416
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:36,390
and by four months ago they were lucky

417
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,390
if they hit 5,000 you

418
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:45,280
even be accessing their system now

419
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,280
they're having 5,000

420
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,680
having to ramp up Orman's scale their

421
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,260
server skill their instances like

422
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,500
everybody else

423
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,940
but these pivots of both what features

424
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,320
were going to build when we're going to

425
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,990
miss them as well as scaling up are

426
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,799
things that organizations that have been

427
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:13,980
able to have it like that word but

428
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,090
change what they're doing to be

429
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,910
prioritised

430
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,740
Burke the organization's I've been able

431
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,260
to that more quickly are the ones that

432
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,910
have been able to take advantage of this

433
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:31,679
opportunity or them to our market share

434
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:34,429
to visibility across the board so it's

435
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,429
important

436
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:42,410
are able to sell the ideas behind

437
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:46,550
architecture idea

438
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,790
in our ability to change a longer time

439
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,790
and

440
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:56,940
I don't know that I did a good job of

441
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,940
bring that but you will probably let me

442
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,670
know in the comments and I don't see any

443
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:07,710
comments coming in so let me just check

444
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:12,150
my list of things and I did have our

445
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:15,660
conversation with um a couple of folks

446
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:20,860
after the class around how do you get

447
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:25,330
executive buy-in who do you get people

448
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:28,440
and God executive and leadership who are

449
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,440
not yet on

450
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:34,919
process the ideas ility of changing the

451
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:36,850
week not just level but about the

452
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,140
organization too

453
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:44,680
ditch the idea of the tip hierarchies

454
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,370
our mental model move towards stick

455
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,220
Dylan

456
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,520
a shallower hierarchies that's I I

457
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,130
didn't have a good answer at how do we

458
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,470
change I mostly worked with

459
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,710
organizations I've already decided to

460
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,710
