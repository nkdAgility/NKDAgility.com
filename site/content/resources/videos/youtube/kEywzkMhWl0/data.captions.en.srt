1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,779
I think the the main critical skill for

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,540
a scrum Master is to be able to teach

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,420
and teach things in a way that help

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,540
people understand

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:18,420
what it is not just the mechanics of how

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,420
to do it so actually teaching people and

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,859
I think the the why is that most

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,260
people will resist things unless they

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,619
understand why they should be doing a

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,500
thing what value do they get from it

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,840
um so being able to to teach to teach

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,020
the fundamentals and have people

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,000
understand they'll often come to the the

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,200
the the realization that they need to do

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
something different themselves
