1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,480
so the product development Mentor

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,000
program for software organizations is

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,840
designed around

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,839
helping people that actually build the

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,920
products so in scrum we would call those

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,359
folks the developers right but that

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,480
includes testers coders it includes

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,599
analysts it includes product owners it

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
includes cyber security operations it

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,560
includes all of the people involved in

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
building and creating a product and the

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,520
product development Mentor

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,760
program is how do

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,719
we build in excellence to the way we do

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,320
things how do we enable um happy

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,840
creative people who are working together

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,520
towards a common goal right I I don't

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,160
know if you've noticed or I don't know

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,640
if you've thought about this but unhappy

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,079
sad people don't build amazing

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,360
products if the people that work on your

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,000
product feel like they're unable to

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,880
achieve the things that they're asked to

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,840
achieve by the business they're going to

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,080
be unhappy if they feel like the things

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,720
that they're doing don't add value to

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,560
the organization they're going to be

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,680
unhappy if they feel like that they know

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,159
how to do something better than other

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,079
people that are telling them how to do

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,920
it in the organization they're going to

32
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,880
be unhappy unhappy sad people don't

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,560
build amazing products so how do we turn

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,479
that around and enable the people in

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,640
your

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,000
organization to step up we have to

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,320
enable them to step up and be able to

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
deliver the highest possible value and

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,799
that means they're going to have to be

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,119
happy and engaged in what it is they're

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,799
doing they're we're going to have to

42
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,600
look at things not just around the the

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
the the the the process like your ways

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
of work and how you manage that work but

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,200
how do you manage dependencies how do

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,920
you do devops and continuous delivery

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,120
how do you do testing how do you

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,200
integrate more feedback loops into your

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,920
process for all of those different

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,760
process control systems that you might

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,000
have within your organization and build

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
a story and a culture of engineering

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,200
Excellence within your

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,800
organization because that happy

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,319
motivated once things to be successful

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,920
wants things to be valuable for their

57
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,120
customers and for them and for your

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
business is the mindset that we want in

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,920
people that are all working together

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,720
towards building this product it's not

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,400
just enough to have that direction right

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,040
although that's quite a lot of the story

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,360
they also need the knowledge and skills

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,840
they need to understand the theory

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
behind why we're doing things a certain

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,519
certain way so that they can take that

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,519
story forward it's not them doing it a

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,519
particular way because they've been told

69
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
to they understand the theories and

70
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,799
principles behind the things that we're

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,000
trying to do they understand why they

72
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,319
need to pay more attention to the

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,760
quality of the product they understand

74
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,239
why they need to be trying to engage

75
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,560
with the customers more every developer

76
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,760
in your organization should be able to

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,080
engage with customers almost every

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,920
developers should be able to engage with

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,319
customers and communicate with them

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,040
effectively so that we can maximize the

81
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,360
value because ultimately the people that

82
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,760
are doing the work on the teams that are

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,120
working on your product are the ones

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,959
that are making the majority of the

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,159
decisions even if you feel like that's

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,239
not true it is true they're making the

87
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,640
majority of the decisions every day

88
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,040
every person on every team in your

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,000
organization is making hundreds if not

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,439
thousands of micro decisions that will

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
impact the future of the product the

92
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,120
future of how users use it and they're

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,319
not asking anybody because they don't

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,359
believe that anybody else would

95
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:22,120
understand the situation right so the

96
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,120
way I think about it is if I was I'm my

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,639
background is software engineering so if

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:32,320
I was making a decision on uh whether I

99
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,199
use an array or a linked list right

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,520
linked list might be more efficient for

101
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,280
the thing that I'm trying to do but if

102
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm looking forward into the future if

103
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,360
I'm thinking about what is it we're

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,440
trying to achieve I'm collaborating

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,080
heavily with the business I understand

106
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,880
the goals and objectives of what it is

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,400
we're trying to achieve I've been

108
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,840
communicating with customers and I

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,840
understand their wants needs and desires

110
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,240
I might realize that a linked list is

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,639
not the best

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,320
uh solution for this particular problem

113
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,520
and I should use the less efficient

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,160
array because it's going to provide us

115
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,680
with more benefits going forward into

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,000
the future and that sort of choice

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,759
that's just one choice that might have

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,120
taken me 20 seconds to make a a and a

119
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,919
couple of hours of

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,199
implementation in my the system but that

121
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,199
could have a implication on what it is

122
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,639
we're able to do tomorrow what it is

123
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,800
we're able to do next week um and it

124
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,840
would take a bunch of rework to go back

125
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,880
and make those changes later now we want

126
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,960
to be able to go make those changes

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
later which is why good testing good

128
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,319
architectures engineering Excellence

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
will mean we

130
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,520
can but what if we could make more of

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
the right decisions and every single

132
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,919
person on the team could make more of

133
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,919
the right decisions as we flow towards

134
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,440
the end of our product because the

135
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,680
further we get down that line of of

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
building our product the more of our

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,560
product we've actually created right our

138
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,800
inventory of product is bigger and

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,199
making changes to that rearranging the

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,960
warehouse right if you've got 10 things

141
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,520
in your Warehouse it's super easy to

142
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,680
rearrange if you've got a 100,000 things

143
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,560
in your Warehouse it's not very easy to

144
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,919
rearrange right and the chances of

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
something going wrong something going

146
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,120
missing all of those things is is pretty

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,280
high how do we create an environment

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,479
within which those things are just not

149
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,400
true we're not going to have we're gen

150
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,160
in general we're not going to have those

151
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,560
mistakes because everybody is paying

152
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,880
attention to what it is we're trying to

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,479
do we're working together towards that

154
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,400
common goal we're making decisions based

155
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,400
on the best possible outcomes with the

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,800
inbuilt knowledge of what's happening in

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,639
the future intent based leadership right

158
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,000
how do we create that story at the team

159
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,280
level so that we're all going in the

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,280
same direction
