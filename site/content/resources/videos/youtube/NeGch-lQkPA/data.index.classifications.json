    "reasoning": "The content discusses integrating Kanban metrics into Scrum, focusing on actionable practices to enhance team performance, which aligns well with the category 'Tenet'. It directly mentions metrics and practices that improve flow and data-driven decision-making, both of which are core themes of tenets in Agile methodologies. The depth of discussion provides specific examples of how to integrate these metrics into Scrum events, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of actionable guiding rules. Consequently, it holds a strong alignment with the tenet category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is an overview of a course that focuses on 'applying flow metrics' to Scrum. It discusses integration of Kanban metrics—such as cycle time, lead time, throughput, and WIP limits—into Scrum events. While it covers concepts related to flow, value delivery, and improvement, Service Level Expectation (SLE) is not directly mentioned nor is its definition or core application explored. There is no explicit calculation or use of SLE as a forecast of elapsed time and probability, nor coverage of SLE-specific guidance per Agile or Kanban literature. Signal-to-noise is penalized due to general agile promotional content. Audience alignment is reasonable since practitioners are targeted. However, the main purpose and depth are not focused on SLE but on general flow metrics, keeping the confidence score low and all dimensions except audience in the lower range.",
