1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,360
automation plays a massive role in

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,599
enabling your your your your teams to

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,640
develop faster and more effectively

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,600
right automation is almost

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,320
the the thing that supports your ability

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,080
to do that and you should automate

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,800
everything if it can be automated it

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,519
should be automated if it can't be

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,760
automated you want to do the work in

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,840
your product to enable that thing to be

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,680
automated right so automated deployments

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,280
automated testing I I use aure devops as

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,760
as an example a lot because they've done

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,840
a lot of this work and hit a lot of

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,120
these problems one of the things that

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,719
they started doing was they wanted to

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,039
automate the the the changing of

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,239
security right so on every deployment

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,760
every security key every certificate

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,239
everything is refreshed

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,840
every environment every server you know

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,400
so infrastructure is code everything is

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,640
refreshed so you never

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,799
deploy they never deploy to upgrade the

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,720
version of their service on an existing

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,439
environment they build a new environment

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,360
and put that in and take the old

28
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,240
environment out right and these these

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,159
sorts of

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,880
automations enable you to continuously

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,560
be as slick as

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,680
possible right and it means

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,799
that one thing that's really important

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,079
to understand is that humans suck at

35
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,479
following a set of steps in the same way

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,560
every time that's what robots are for

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,680
right robots follow a set of steps

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
continuously that's what automation is

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,119
automation follows a set of steps and

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,360
always follows it the same way and

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,640
always follows all of the steps right so

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,560
if you get an exception or you a problem

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
there's a problem with the steps right

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,200
um when humans are following a set of

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,480
steps manually for example then you

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,720
don't know whether the problem is with

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
the set of steps or the problem is with

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,440
the human following the

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,879
steps and that's a risk you don't need

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,879
it's absolutely a risk you don't need so

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
a great example of that is the night

52
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,120
Capital group in the US it was a company

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,319
in the US they had 450 million in the

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
bank at the beginning of the day and

55
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,800
they were doing a deployment of of of a

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
new new version of their system and a

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
lot of a lot of things were not quite

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,080
right they were repurposing some some

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,280
code in their product they were H doing

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,480
doing a bunch of silly things because

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
they didn't have good quality but they

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,319
also were doing a manual deployment and

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,319
the the engineer that did the deployment

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
deployed to six out of the seven servers

65
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,319
that they had

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,239
so the system then started behaving

67
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,159
oddly because six of the servers had the

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,799
correct code and one of the servers

69
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,519
didn't have the correct code so if you

70
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,760
can imagine a load balancing situation

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,959
where you're trying to you're trying

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
you're looking at the system it's not

73
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,560
working it's not functioning properly

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,400
but you can't figure out why cuz some

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,040
calls are working and some calls are not

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,720
and it looks kind of random because it's

77
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,319
the load balancer that's load balancing

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,280
between the servers it took them all day

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,519
to figure it out but they'd started

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,120
losing thousands of dollars every second

81
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,920
and with 450 million in the bank at the

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
beginning of the day by the end of the

83
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,959
day they had to file for chapter 11

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,040
bankruptcy they were listed in the New

85
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,360
York Stock Exchange which is why we know

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040
what the problem was because they had to

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,799
file that as part of their bankruptcy

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,360
filing that would have been

89
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,720
prevented by automation it would have

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
been prevented by automated testing it

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,360
would have been prevented by automated

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,480
deployment

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,519
it would have been prevented by

94
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,480
automated checks a more recent one that

95
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,799
had a massive Global impact was Cloud

96
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,040
strike right that would have been

97
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,400
prevented by automation it would have

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,759
prevented by automated deployment it

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,840
would have been prevented by automated

100
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,600
checks it would have been prevented by

101
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,400
these types of capabilities that we're

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,960
talking about as you increase the number

103
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,240
of deployments that you do you're forced

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,240
to deal with these types of scenarios

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
right how do I roll out to a smaller

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,479
group of people so that I can figure out

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,360
whether one of my favorite quotes is

108
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
from a gentleman called Brian Harry

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,960
Brian Harry was the product unit manager

110
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,039
for the Azure devops team so he ran that

111
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,600
whole developer division at Microsoft

112
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,320
for many years and his his one of his

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,720
mantras was that there's no place like

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,680
production you know like kind of Dorothy

115
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,240
type of thing clicking The Red

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,199
Shoes there's no place like produ

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,000
no matter how much testing you do no

118
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,919
matter how much validation no matter how

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,560
much money you throw that throw at that

120
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,639
no matter how much time you throw at

121
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,759
that you're going to have production

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,479
issues you're going to have production

123
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,639
issues because you can't simulate

124
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,680
production it's not fundamentally

125
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,240
possible you can do your best and you

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
can spend an awful lot of money trying

127
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,160
to figure out how to simulate production

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,520
as much as possible but there's always

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
gaps it's not possible to simulate

130
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,080
production to simulate the type of

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,720
transaction simulate simulate what users

132
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,560
do it's not possible so a better

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,560
strategy than testing quality in is to

134
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,639
build quality in and if you're building

135
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,440
quality in you want to get that product

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,280
in front of real customers in production

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,199
as quickly as possible I I Google Google

138
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,400
does no Facebook it's Facebook I was

139
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,639
thinking of Facebook do a really

140
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,360
interesting thing where when a

141
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,840
developers rolling out their their new

142
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,720
version of the the the the product they

143
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,639
have a point in time when a call into

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,800
Facebook is executed twice it's executed

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,199
with the current production version and

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,080
then it's executed with the new version

147
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,280
that's not in production yet so it

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,319
execute execute execute execute execute

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,120
execute and then they can turn up the

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,759
dial and go from a small like 10,000

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,039
users up to 10 million users up to 100

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,039
million users doing this and developers

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,520
can see the

154
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,280
Telemetry for what's happening with this

155
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,319
is it is it performing well is it doing

156
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,039
the right thing is it having similar you

157
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,160
know comparing the output from the two

158
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,680
and what they what they they actually do

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,440
is they do it completely automated so

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,280
the time from a developer committing a

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,199
new capability to it replacing this

162
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,479
production capability that's there is as

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,160
I understand about 13 12 to 13 minutes

164
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,800
and that's with full test Suite full

165
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,560
regression full validation of do they

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,599
operate the same way do they have the

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,039
same output that we need do they work in

168
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,080
that contact do they perform and scaled

169
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,960
out across the entire platform in about

170
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,319
13 minutes so they can have these small

171
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,720
changes small fixes go out really

172
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
quickly and then when they work on

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,759
bigger things perhaps they're using

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,039
feature Flags or they're using other

175
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,840
capability

176
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,560
so automation that's an automated

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,199
process automation is

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:46,440
absolutely critical to your ability and

179
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:48,800
your product's ability to to have fast

180
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,039
reliable the fast reliable ability to

181
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,599
add features fast reliable ability to

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
deal with problems to deal with

183
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,680
surprises and opportunities as they

184
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,680
arise in your Market
