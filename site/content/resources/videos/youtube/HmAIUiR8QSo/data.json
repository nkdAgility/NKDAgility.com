    "description": "# Building a Culture of Quality and Engineering Excellence | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\nðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I explore how to build a **culture of quality** within your organization. Delivering great products isnâ€™t just about tools or processesâ€”itâ€™s about fostering technical leadership, engineering excellence, and shared accountability across your teams. Using real-world examples, including lessons from Boeing and Volkswagen, Iâ€™ll show you why culture is the foundation of innovation and trust.\n\n**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  \n1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Culture is Critical to Quality  \n2. 03:00 â€“ Engineering Excellence: Lessons from Boeingâ€™s Rise and Fall  \n3. 07:15 â€“ The Risks of Prioritizing Revenue Over Quality  \n4. 10:30 â€“ Agile Frameworks Are Tools, Not Solutions  \n5. 13:45 â€“ What a Culture of Quality Looks Like in Practice  \n6. 17:00 â€“ Empowering Teams with Knowledge and Leadership  \n7. 20:30 â€“ How Naked Agility Can Support Your Journey  \n\n**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  \n- Engineering leaders aiming to build a culture of excellence within their teams  \n- Product owners and business leaders focused on long-term product quality  \n- Agile practitioners seeking to align tools and frameworks with organizational culture  \n- Organizations looking to prevent failures caused by cultural and ethical missteps  \n\n**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  \n- Why a culture of quality requires collective responsibility and technical leadership  \n- The dangers of prioritizing short-term revenue over long-term value  \n- Real-world examples of cultural collapse from Boeing and Volkswagen  \n- How Agile frameworks fit into a culture of quality and why theyâ€™re just tools  \n- Strategies for empowering teams with knowledge, leadership, and engineering excellence  \n\n**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  \n- Tools and frameworks are only as effective as the culture that uses them.  \n- A culture of quality prevents ethical lapses and fosters innovation and trust.  \n- Technical leadership and engineering excellence are contagiousâ€”when demonstrated, they inspire others.  \n- Building a culture of quality takes time, effort, and a focus on shared values.  \n\nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we partner with organizations to build a culture of quality, technical leadership, and engineering excellence.
