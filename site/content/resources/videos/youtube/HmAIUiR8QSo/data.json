    "description": "# Building a Culture of Quality and Engineering Excellence | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I explore how to build a **culture of quality** within your organization. Delivering great products isn’t just about tools or processes, it’s about fostering technical leadership, engineering excellence, and shared accountability across your teams. Using real-world examples, including lessons from Boeing and Volkswagen, I’ll show you why culture is the foundation of innovation and trust.\n\n**📌 Chapters:**  \n1. 00:00 – Introduction: Why Culture is Critical to Quality  \n2. 03:00 – Engineering Excellence: Lessons from Boeing’s Rise and Fall  \n3. 07:15 – The Risks of Prioritizing Revenue Over Quality  \n4. 10:30 – Agile Frameworks Are Tools, Not Solutions  \n5. 13:45 – What a Culture of Quality Looks Like in Practice  \n6. 17:00 – Empowering Teams with Knowledge and Leadership  \n7. 20:30 – How Naked Agility Can Support Your Journey  \n\n**🎯 Who This Video is For:**  \n- Engineering leaders aiming to build a culture of excellence within their teams  \n- Product owners and business leaders focused on long-term product quality  \n- Agile practitioners seeking to align tools and frameworks with organizational culture  \n- Organizations looking to prevent failures caused by cultural and ethical missteps  \n\n**📖 What You’ll Learn:**  \n- Why a culture of quality requires collective responsibility and technical leadership  \n- The dangers of prioritizing short-term revenue over long-term value  \n- Real-world examples of cultural collapse from Boeing and Volkswagen  \n- How Agile frameworks fit into a culture of quality and why they’re just tools  \n- Strategies for empowering teams with knowledge, leadership, and engineering excellence  \n\n**💡 Key Takeaways:**  \n- Tools and frameworks are only as effective as the culture that uses them.  \n- A culture of quality prevents ethical lapses and fosters innovation and trust.  \n- Technical leadership and engineering excellence are contagious, when demonstrated, they inspire others.  \n- Building a culture of quality takes time, effort, and a focus on shared values.  \n\nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we partner with organizations to build a culture of quality, technical leadership, and engineering excellence. We can’t do it for you, but we’ll help you understand the theories, practices, and decisions that lead to great products. Ready to start?
