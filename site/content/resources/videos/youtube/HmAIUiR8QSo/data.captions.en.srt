1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,639
building a culture of quality within

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:11,840
your organization is absolutely not

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,440
something that you can do on your own

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,520
it's not something that any individual

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,119
can

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:24,519
do each individual within the context of

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:29,359
your organization needs to be able

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,519
to demonstrate their own technical

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
excellence

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,800
their technical leadership their their

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,320
engineering capability if they

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,320
demonstrate their own other people

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,719
around them will see a way of

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,079
Behaving that hopefully they want to

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,520
copy the more people in your

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
organization behave that way the quicker

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,399
other people in your organization will

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,519
see that as the way to behave I I I was

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,920
trying to think of an example there of

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,199
of of

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,080
it that being true and I I really keep

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,400
coming back to the opposite being true

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,320
um and that's that's the boing story if

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,040
you've been following the Boeing story

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,960
really for many years the Boeing story's

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,000
been been going on when

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,320
Boeing before Boeing bought McDonald

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,479
Douglas Boeing's Focus was on

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,399
engineering Excellence technical

30
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:36,560
leadership ship and they built that

31
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,680
Mantra of if it's not boing I'm not

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,479
going I theirs were the best planes they

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,799
were the best build qualities they were

34
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,360
the least likely to fall out the sky

35
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,560
they were they were the standard for

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,960
quality in the entire aviation

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,920
industry and then and they had that

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,320
culture engineering excellence and and

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,159
Technical leadership and and then they

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,320
moved they bought McDonald Douglas and

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,479
through some weird happenings which I

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,840
don't fully understand M McDonald

43
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,640
Douglas came out on top of being in

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,480
charge right McDonald Douglas's

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,760
leadership and their focus was on

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,640
Revenue extraction that was their focus

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,480
we're we're not here to build value

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,360
we're here to extract money for our

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,959
shareholders and for ourselves that's

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,840
what we're here for and over the next 20

51
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,200
years I think it's been 20 years I might

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,360
be a little bit out there 15 20

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,239
years they've decimated that culture

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,440
that culture of quality inside of boing

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
completely and utterly destroyed it so

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,200
much so that that you might have seen

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,280
seen videos of Boeing

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,920
Employees saying you know yes I'd fly in

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,879
this plane but yeah I've got a death

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,840
wish right that's not if if you're going

61
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,360
to be flying in a in a in a plane that's

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,760
not what you want the the culture you

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
want with within the context of the

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,799
engineers that are building it so why

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,840
would you want it within the context of

66
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,799
the software that you're purchasing the

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,200
software that you're using and how much

68
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,360
of the software that we use is actually

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,959
life critical or actually has a substant

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,239
substantive substantive impact on our

71
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:26,480
quality of life on our on the world

72
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:29,879
around us and we we want those products

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,120
to be built within the context of a

74
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,599
culture of quality of delivering the

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,840
right thing of doing the right thing and

76
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,040
providing us with value not let's cut

77
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,120
all the corners we possibly can to

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,159
deliver more Revenue to our

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:54,560
shareholders right so if you want to

80
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,879
build amazing products rather than

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,159
mediocre or even dangerous

82
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:05,439
products we need to focus on the things

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,319
that really matter and you know agile a

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,920
agile people talk about agile Frameworks

85
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,560
all the time and how agile Frameworks

86
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,920
were the solution and agile Frameworks

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,120
are now the problem none of those things

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,799
are

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:22,000
true agile Frameworks are just tools

90
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,199
that we use it's the culture within our

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,759
organization that leverages those tools

92
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,280
in a positive or negative way a hammer

93
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,240
is just a tool but you can use it to hit

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
a nail or you can use it to smack

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,600
somebody around the head and which one

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,919
is going to add value and which one's

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,360
going to land you in jail right so

98
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,680
building those those those cultures of

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,680
quality can you what world of culture of

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,919
quality did a Volkswagen engineer write

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,800
code that determined whether a car was

102
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,919
in a test condition and faked the

103
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
results right changed the way the end

104
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,680
didn't fake the results they changed the

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
way the engine operated in order to get

106
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,120
the results they wanted and the engine

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,080
operated differently on the road right

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,240
what world of

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,639
quality does anybody in your

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
organization make that sort of decision

111
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,800
no world of quality if you have a

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,800
culture of quality you're not going to

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
have people make that decision and

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,560
that's what we need to focus on we need

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,800
to focus on building a culture of

116
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,440
engineering Excellence the technical

117
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,520
leadership to set that direction and go

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,400
in that direction and we need to build

119
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,400
within our

120
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,120
organization the the knowledge and

121
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,039
understanding of the theories behind the

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,080
reasons the things work the way they

123
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,520
work and how we can then apply our

124
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,520
empirical learnings within our context

125
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,240
so every organization's

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,280
different with the knowledge of those

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,319
theories to then extrapolate what's the

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,639
next best decision

129
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,199
that we can make and this is something

130
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,800
that naked agility can help you and your

131
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,880
organization do we cannot do it for you

132
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,840
but we can be there to help you

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,680
understand the theories and practices

134
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,039
how they apply within your context and

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,639
what are good engineering decisions and

136
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,720
what are bad engineering decisions so

137
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,080
build engineering excellence and

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Technical leadership within your

139
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
organization
