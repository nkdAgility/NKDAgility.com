1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,359
too much of anything can be a bad thing

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,719
and that leads us to one of our seven

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,280
agile virtues which is temperance you

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,199
need to take everything in um in measure

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,800
right make sure that you don't do too

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
much of something that that could

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,160
manifest in our world um as having too

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,279
much backlog what does it mean to have a

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,880
lean inventory in your backlog what does

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,559
it mean to not put things in there to

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,480
think a little bit more carefully about

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,640
whether something should be in your

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,879
backlog or not um what does it mean uh

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,680
uh to have H just enough and no more

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,320
that's a that's a common phrase that we

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,840
use a lot um especially in the scrum

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
space I I remember I I have this picture

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,000
in my head of Ken saying it to me many

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,199
years ago um just enough and no more and

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,320
I believe in fact he actually I think he

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,600
said that um no matter what quantity

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,520
question I ask

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,320
him the answer is going to be just

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,200
enough and no more doesn't matter what

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,159
the quantity question is right so how

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,720
much backlog should we have just enough

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,960
and no more how many developers should

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,320
we have just enough and no more how much

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,920
time should we spend on refinement just

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,159
enough and no more same for planning up

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,079
up front that

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,880
Mantra of

33
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:42,920
um

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:47,119
being focused on what it is we're doing

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,759
and minimizing our effort one of the the

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,799
um principles in the agile Manifesto is

37
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,680
maximizing the amount of work not done

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,640
right um and that's that idea of

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,439
temperance maximize the amount of work

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,640
not not done minimize your effort for

41
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:10,119
the maximum gain and always look to take

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,800
the easy path where you can but be

43
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,120
willing to take the hard path when you

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
can't if you are having difficulty

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,640
