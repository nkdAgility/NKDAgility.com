However, it does not directly discuss the core practices of Hypothesis Driven Development (e.g., formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, A/B testing, validating decisions through data). No mention is made of validated learning or the scientific method as applied to product changes. While the narrative values feedback and learning, it is mostly positioned at a strategic and cultural level, not at the practical, experimental, or hypothesis-driven practices level. The intended audience (Agile professionals and Product Owners) overlaps with the target for Hypothesis Driven Development, and the signal-to-noise ratio is high, but the conceptual and direct alignment with the category is only partial.",
