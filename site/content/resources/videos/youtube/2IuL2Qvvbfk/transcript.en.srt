1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,300
question is what's the the biggest

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,320
contribution

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,139
from a product owner that you know of

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,940
and I think I think they're they're I

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,680
think there are a lot of great product

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,660
owners out there

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,420
um great product managers

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,920
but the one that I always think of

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,720
when I think about great product

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,300
management

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,399
um is that is is kind of two people in

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,280
the same organization both kind of

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,540
product owners in the same product which

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,280
is confusing because then there's two

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,140
product owners right but I'll try and

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,200
explain

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,420
um and that's that's effectively Brian

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
Brian Harry

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,520
um who was the product unit manager for

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,039
uh Team Foundation server for the entire

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,820
developer division at Microsoft back in

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,520
the day

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,160
uh when I was getting into all of this

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,160
stuff he was he was the man

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,140
and he

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,560
um realized

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,860
as the single responsible person for

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,560
about 650 people

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,439
um working on on this products

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,720
that a two yearly release Cadence kind

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,939
of sucks right

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,720
um so that his was the first team in

33
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,479
Microsoft and to start really on mass

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,880
start moving towards a greater degree of

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,100
agility and

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,439
his

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,079
the way they came up with within the

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,159
context of Microsoft for for doing that

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,680
stuff

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
is almost the model that was replicated

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
across the organization right it's never

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,920
going to be identical right but that's

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
that's the the when if you hear

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,820
Microsoft talking about their

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,320
season-based model

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,299
um which they do talk about they have

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
the spring release and the fall release

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,280
right this kind of cadence of of bigger

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,259
things that they're working on

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,460
um of product goals maybe right that's

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,380
really what they're talking about is

52
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,000
this season-based model

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,239
um where they have that that Urban Flow

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,140
of of of work and ideas but Brian Harry

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,980
worked on that very much supported by my

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,340
other favorite gentleman uh Aaron Bjork

57
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,080
um who was in effect if you're not

58
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,360
familiar with if you're not familiar

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,700
with TFS and it's now called as your

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,920
devops right that's effectively at what

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,260
it is back in the day uh Microsoft was

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,319
doing two-year releases of Team

63
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,480
Foundation server and uh visual studio

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,640
right kind of can I can go together

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,160
doing two yearly releases and what they

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,560
found was that the the the the Cadence

67
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,360
for closing the feedback loop

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,819
um was actually

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
four to six years because they were in a

70
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,860
two yearly Cadence it's two to three

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,780
times whatever your delivery Cadence of

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,879
usable working product is

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,700
that's that's ultimately your your

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,019
feedback Cadence because what they found

75
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,700
was that that

76
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,599
um you know they would do a beta halfway

77
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,580
through

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,920
to get feedback from people

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,200
but they'd already

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,879
as soon as you you've shipped that beta

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,700
you're now working on

82
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,920
this stuff that you need to do for lunch

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,420
and the feedback you get on the beta you

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,920
can't actually fit it in here because

85
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,659
you don't have anything you don't have

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,700
any time left you're all booked

87
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,959
right you've booked out that time for

88
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,940
the stuff you need to do to get it to

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,000
production so then you start thinking

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,980
about well maybe we can fit it into the

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
next yearly release and they were able

92
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,840
to fit some stuff in there but what they

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
also often realized was the closer they

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,440
get to that production release they've

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,780
already

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,640
by the time they finish the beta they're

97
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,200
planning for the next two yearly release

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
right

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,060
so they all they've already booking out

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,140
this time as the feedback comes in on

101
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,980
this product

102
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,659
so the earliest you can possibly get

103
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,000
that feedback from the beta into the

104
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,099
actual working product is is is is two

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,659
years down the line right or two and a

106
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,940
half up to two and a half years down the

107
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,920
line but in actual fact some staff might

108
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,560
not make it into that time box so it's

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,060
the next time box which is another which

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
is four years four to four and a half

111
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,060
years down the line which is just too

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,180
long right it's just too long so what in

113
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,979
realizing that this leadership group uh

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,720
in this this organization in this part

115
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,520
of the organization they realized that

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,220
they had to do something different and

117
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,919
he led the way in his organization in

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,360
making those those changes largely

119
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,620
leveraging the respect uh uh for his

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,740
um

121
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,540
I don't know his choices his his wisdom

122
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,919
within the organization the respect and

123
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,259
the rest of the organization for his

124
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,360
wisdom allowed him to maybe do things

125
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,699
that other people weren't able to do or

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,160
hadn't been able to do in the past and

127
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,460
he is Relentless this this guy he'll

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,259
work 20-hour days no problem at all

129
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,120
um he's just one of those folks that has

130
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,660
that that Outlook

131
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,960
um and he him along with Aaron Bjork

132
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,540
um effectively changed the way Microsoft

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,940
do business changed the way Microsoft

134
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,300
approached Building Products

135
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,180
um and changed the whole ethos I mean

136
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,979
not without support right

137
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,620
um somebody else has to come along and

138
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,500
water those ideas and help them grow and

139
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,460
that was Satya who was able to uh uh

140
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,500
come along into Microsoft and then start

141
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,080
encouraging a lot of these ideas uh but

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,380
the kernel for these ideas was pre-satio

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
it was uh the Azure devops team and they

144
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,419
moved to three week three week

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,820
continuous Cadence so it in in fact the

146
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,340
product owner who that's that's how I

147
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,740
see the product unit manager right fully

148
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,800
fiscally accountable

149
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,660
um person in your product structure

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
um they're the ones that are actually

151
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,300
best placed to enable changes in your

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,940
organization anyway they're the ones

153
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,160
with the money they're the ones with

154
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,800
well if I'm going to spend your money

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,720
building this product I need to be able

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,280
to control this and this and this in

157
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,900
order to be most effective at building

158
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,479
this product they're the ones who need

159
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,759
to have that argument it's not your

160
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,120
agile coaches or add your Consultants or

161
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,380
any of these people like what what the

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
hell do they know about your business

163
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,340
right that's that's that's the attitude

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,819
internally

165
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,400
but one of the core purposes of that

166
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,520
that agile coach and consultant is to

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,620
help them that person who can make that

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,720
change who who does have that respect

169
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,360
inside of the organization who does have

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,940
that fiscal accountability make those

171
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,520
changes and that that was the

172
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,780
that huge I just think it's such a huge

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,460
contribution

174
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,639
um that Brian Harry and Aaron Bjork made

175
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,620
to to this idea of of Building Products

176
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,960
inside of Microsoft right but Building

177
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,380
Products in general because the whole

178
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,020
ethos of azure devops is about

179
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,720
devops right it's about shortening those

180
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,440
feedback loops what tools do we need to

181
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,160
support that idea and yeah that for me

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,560
is the the most powerful powerful story
