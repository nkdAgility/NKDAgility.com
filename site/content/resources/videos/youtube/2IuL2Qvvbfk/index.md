# Biggest contribution from a product owner that you know of?

#scrum purposefully created the #productowner role to ensure that the focus shifted from #projectmanagement to #productdevelopment. Purposefully created a role where a single person took ownership of the product and collaborated with a team of people to realise a #productvision that was powerful and inspiring.

What does that look like? What does a powerful contribution from a product owner look like?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about one of the biggest contributions he has witnessed from a product owner. It's kinda cool.
