1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,799
so the PBM course is a fantastic idea

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,800
for product owners because ultimately

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,080
product owners are uh uh the the

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,279
entrepreneur the mini CEO of a product

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:24,560
and if you want to be making um good

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:26,279
decisions about um which bets to make on

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,080
the success of your product right which

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,640
features to build you need to understand

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,000
the holistic outcome of your product the

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,360
whole product and ebm evidence-based

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,399
management can be used to look at a

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,399
whole product and say these These are

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,480
the metrics that we've decided in each

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,440
of the the key value areas right

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,320
unrealized value Uh current value

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,960
ability to innovate and time to Market

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,000
um and we can we once we've chosen those

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,480
metrics we can then monitor them over a

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
long period of time and see that we're

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,039
taking the product in the right

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
direction ction right how do you know

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,320
when you're going off topic uh when

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,640
you're going on a tangent to what your

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,159
organization is trying to achieve when

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,280
you're off the beaten path maybe off the

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,040
beaten path is the best place to be

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,680
because you you look at the data you

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
look at the metrics and holy moly this

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,759
has been really successful right um and

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,479
then you need to have a conversation

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,240
with your business about well we were

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
going this way but actually we think
