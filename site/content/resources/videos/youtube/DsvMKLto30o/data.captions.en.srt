1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,680
so I just wrote a post called stop

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,880
hiding behind complexity and start

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,920
delivering

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,240
continuously and the

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
premise the premise of the

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,039
post is

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,439
that any any

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,359
person in any

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,640
organization working on any

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,640
software anywhere in the

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,120
world but says

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,440
our software is too big and too

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,640
complex to be able to deliver

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,079
continuously is

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
either I don't know I I'm going to be a

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,600
little bit controversial here but

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,000
they're either lying they're

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,440
lazy or they don't know

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,879
how probably they don't know how is the

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,680
most the most likely they M think they

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,840
don't understand how to get from where

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,600
they are right now with their Mainframe

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,080
based Mainframe backed old crusty

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,080
software to continuous delivery we don't

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,720
know how to get there but you can get

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:18,240
there if there was an organizational

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,880
will if there was an organizational will

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,240
to

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,680
improve the the the the the quality of

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,960
the product if there was an

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,680
organizational will to improve the speed

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,320
of delivery of features in the product

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,479
right because improving the delivery of

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,360
features in the product is not about

35
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,840
adding more people it's

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,840
about getting your product in shape

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,719
right if you've got this huge lumbering

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,600
obese product it's not going to be able

39
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,439
to do the things quickly that you want

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,360
it to be able to do people aren't going

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,079
to be able to get it to to to do the

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,920
things that you want it to do quickly

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,159
it's it's lumbering it's the the the the

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,719
the 500 gorilla in the room right but it

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,600
doesn't have to be you how how would you

46
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,959
as an

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,680
individual if you

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,120
were not where you wanted to be

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,200
healthwise how how would you get healthy

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,640
how would you get to that goal that you

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,760
wanted of perhaps you want to look like

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,200
Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine right how

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,000
would you get from where you are right

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,360
now to there because it is possible I

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
mean you wouldn't look exactly like him

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
because everybody's body type's

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
different but you're I mean how how

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,840
would you get that type of physique that

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
level of body fat well you're going to

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,720
have to work you're going to have to

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
work you going have to change all

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,519
aspects of of your life in pursuit of

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
that goal right you you you're going to

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,360
have to eat differently you're going to

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,879
have to exercise differently you're

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,760
going to have to change when you do

67
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,000
things how you do things in order to get

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,560
to that that that physique you want if

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,920
you want your software to get to that

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,760
physique physique so that you it's easy

71
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,680
easy peasy to add features to your

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,959
product then you you've got to do the

73
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,760
work to not just ensure that it gets

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,200
there that's the tough part right if if

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,159
you're incredibly unfit getting to that

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,440
Fitness point is really hard maintaining

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,840
it is easier right once you are fit

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,560
let's call it once the product is fit

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
maintaining it in that position is is

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,000
there definitely easier it still

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,599
requires investment and effort um and

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,920
time to do things but you're you're not

83
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,120
necessarily doing the same things that

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,879
you had to do in order to get there it

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,000
should should should be easier should be

86
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,760
easy and that's where you see a lot of

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,360
um organizations and software struggling

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,599
I think the one the one that gets me is

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,200
every so

90
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,159
often the airlines

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,079
falter right 10 once called it a

92
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,920
scrumble right I know they may not be

93
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,200
doing scrum but it's like a cross

94
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,599
between scrum and stumble you you you

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,640
effectively you trip over your feet you

96
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,120
fall in your face because something's

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
wrong with the way you're doing the way

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,440
you're running the way you're doing

99
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,239
something the way you're building your

100
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,600
product and you fall in your face and if

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
you just pick yourself up and start

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,400
running again you you you're in danger

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,360
of having exactly the same thing happen

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,720
and you see that with the

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,320
airlines right they have these old

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Mainframe systems behind under the

107
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,039
covers deep in the bowels of their

108
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,880
systems but they don't understand they

109
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,560
don't have people that can understand

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,360
anymore I think I think American

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,160
Airlines I heard stories about pulling

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,280
people out of retire going finding the

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,240
last person who could fix the system and

114
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,800
they were in a retirement home and and

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
having to pay them exorbitant amounts of

116
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,680
money to come out

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,759
and take them five minutes to fix it

118
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,240
right knowing where to poke because

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,720
they've lost that knowledge they've lost

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,560
that capability yet they keep that

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,240
system they've lost understanding of a

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,360
system and they keep it around which is

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,720
massive amounts of risk you you see that

124
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,960
American Airlines has been down Delta's

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,199
been down British Airways has been down

126
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,520
and those are the big ones that I can

127
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
think of because they hit the news

128
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,479
because they're massive Airlines but the

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,479
reason they've been down is because

130
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,600
they've not cared for their application

131
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,479
they they've done a one and done right

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,440
you you you you you build it you get to

133
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,080
the end of the project to build it and

134
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
then that project is done there's no

135
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
more funding therefore the product then

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,039
starts to stagnate atrophy and decompose

137
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
that's that's that's what happens right

138
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,919
I mean the system keeps doing what it

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,479
was always doing but the systems around

140
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,080
it are changing the needs of the

141
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,880
business are changing the the the the

142
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,400
world has changed and then you have to

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,280
layer on more and more stuff to take

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,880
care of the fact that this core of the

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,039
system doesn't necessarily work exactly

146
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,240
like you need it to work but you can't

147
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,160
change it

148
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,319
anymore or you feel like you can't

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,680
change it anymore and all all of that is

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,520
crap it's all crap you absolutely can

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,039
change it you absolutely can fix it you

152
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,520
absolutely can make those problems go

153
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,039
away you can make it so you never go

154
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,120
down again you you you can make it so

155
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,440
that when when what was it it was CR

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,560
when crch strike happened right wait

157
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,440
failure of devops let's let's not talk

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,800
about that one but when Crow strike

159
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,479
happened I think it was Delta Airlines I

160
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,199
think it was Delta was was taken out by

161
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,960
it and it it took them a week even

162
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,680
though Crow strike fixed the problem

163
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,560
within hours right so

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,199
theoretically Delta was only out of

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,560
action from the external source for

166
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,960
hours the implication of that

167
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,599
outage the implication was was that that

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,840
they really struggled to get a whole

169
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,639
bunch of systems up because they hadn't

170
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,599
didn't have good resilience didn't have

171
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,039
good Disaster Recovery didn't have

172
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,879
didn't have good stories around these

173
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,639
things that were that were practiced and

174
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,120
manageable and able to be delivered

175
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,360
quickly so it took ages of people

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,479
running around with their hair on fire

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,080
to get stuff working and I think some of

178
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
the stuff didn't come up and running for

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,639
for for a week more than a week after

180
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,240
after after the the

181
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
outage that's that's not good enough

182
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,360
right that's a business risk that's a

183
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,440
Time ball waiting to happen in your

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,479
organization don't have those systems

185
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,080
those are not the right systems for if

186
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,560
you're running a multi-billion Dollar

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,400
business those are not the right systems

188
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,800
man if you're running a little business

189
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,240
right because risk

190
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,599
is what's it called when it matches your

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,319
your your size like if it if it's 10%

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,479
risk that something's going to go down

193
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,680
if you're a small business that's a

194
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,599
massive risk to your business if you're

195
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,080
a huge mass massive multinational is the

196
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,879
same amount of risk right it's 10% of

197
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,199
your business

198
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,919
so portional that's the word I was

199
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,560
looking for fix it get off your ass and

200
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,440
fix it and this is this is not just an

201
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,800
engineering problem right because you'll

202
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,720
probably find that there are Engineers

203
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,240
around this system there are managers of

204
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,120
those Engineers around this system that

205
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,360
that know they know the problem they

206
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,560
know what it they'll take to fix it

207
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,039
right they they they know those things

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,000
but there is no organizational will to

209
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,039
fix it because it's going to take time

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,599
effort and money time effort time and

211
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,599
effort cost money it's going to take

212
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,800
time effort and money to to deliver on

213
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,320
those changes to fix those problems and

214
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,519
organizations don't want to pay for it

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,000
because they don't see the value right

216
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,360
they throw their toys out the prom when

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,320
something goes wrong and demand it be

218
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,880
fixed and demand it never happen again

219
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
but the only way for it to never happen

220
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,880
again is they get out their checkbook

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
and they write a check is big enough to

222
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
make sure it doesn't happen again for

223
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,600
the for the engineers to go fix the

224
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
problem to remove those systems to

225
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,720
replace those systems to upgrade those

226
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,480
systems and to continuously upgrade

227
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,360
those systems they don't have a good

228
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,760
application life cycle management right

229
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,360
they don't have it and and that's

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,160
why I feel like they're hiding behind

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,800
the complexity right oh this is too big

232
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,880
and too complicated and it's too

233
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,480
difficult to do those things with no

234
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,560
it's not it's really not just fix it uh

235
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,519
the windows team went from delivering to

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,760
production once every six years with

237
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,680
massive amounts of Legacy code I I know

238
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,160
somebody who worked on the Windows team

239
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,079
who was talking about what they were

240
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,399
working on and they're the ones that

241
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,680
were responsible for up for do you

242
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,279
remember when you used to copy a file or

243
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,800
group of files from one folder to

244
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,040
another in Windows if there was one file

245
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,839
that had an error it would just crap out

246
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,720
the process and stop and you've copied

247
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,959
half the files and you don't have not

248
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
copied the rest and you don't know which

249
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,480
is which and they went in and

250
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,320
changed the file copying protocols so

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,920
that it had resum ability and it had the

252
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,480
retry button and all of those things

253
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,040
that was that was their

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,279
work and the code that they were

255
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,440
changing hadn't been changed since

256
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,200
1985 this was maybe 10 years ago right

257
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,959
so what's that

258
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,800
uh 20 had changed in 20 years that's not

259
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,560
good enough and that's that's why that's

260
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,839
part that's not the reason that's not

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,079
the cause but that's why Windows changed

262
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,000
that's why Windows be became this

263
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,360
continuous delivery story because that's

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,040
how you build modern products continuous

265
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:54,000
delivery forces you to deal with those

266
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
problems because they magnify they start

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,839
magnifying right if you're trying to do

268
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,440
continuous delivery and you've got some

269
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,120
slow moving mainframe system in the back

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,320
end that the team can only deploy once a

271
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,800
month and you're deploying many times a

272
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
day and you need changes from them

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,760
they're not going to be able to keep up

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,440
they're just not they're going to be

275
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,760
they're going to become the bottleneck

276
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
they're going to become the the the the

277
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,959
the the the thing that you need to go

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,800
fix so go fix it don't just look at it

279
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,279
and go yeah I've got a pro I've got

280
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,880
another blog post about ignoring the

281
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,720
signals right that's a signal in your

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,320
organiz ation to say there's something

283
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,880
wrong here you need to fix it and yes it

284
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,399
might take investment of money time and

285
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,920
effort as your devops when it was TFS

286
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,560
took about I guess they went to

287
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
deploying as your devops overnight

288
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,399
getting it up and running within a

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:54,959
couple of weeks but to really pay back

290
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:59,000
the the the technical cruft the the long

291
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,279
years of just fire and forget code right

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,519
to really start to pay that back took

293
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,519
them almost four years of of of

294
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,120
continuous effort now they're delivering

295
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,600
features and in fact they were ramping

296
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,639
up and delivering more and more and more

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
features throughout that time but they

298
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,279
still had to continue that effort and

299
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,760
they continue that effort to this day to

300
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,000
to to to start breaking up some of those

301
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,399
monolith pieces that make sense to break

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,040
up because there's nothing wrong with a

303
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,920
monolith but break them up so that they

304
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,360
can deliver some things continuously and

305
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,040
other things take longer and what do you

306
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,760
need is a business there has to be a

307
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,440
business need for it and I can I can't

308
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,760
imagine the American Airlines is sitting

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,240
there saying we're okay with this

310
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,600
ticking Time Bomb of risk that could

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,519
happen at any moment at any time on any

312
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,320
day it could happen on Christmas Day it

313
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,880
could happen on our biggest sales day of

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,600
the year and we're okay with that

315
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,600
nobody's sitting there doing that they

316
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,199
just don't want to Pony up the door and

317
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,560
get off their ass and fix the problem no

318
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:04,800
matter how much complexity you have in

319
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,680
your system you can positive move

320
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,680
towards continuous delivery
