While there is some minor thematic adjacency, such as continuous improvement and responsiveness, the core ideas revolve entirely around legacy modernization, delivery pipelines, application lifecycle management, and cultural change. The audience is adjacent (engineering and leadership stakeholders in software delivery), but not specifically SLE practitioners. The content does not drift into irrelevant tangents, thus the signal score is higher, but direct category relevance is virtually absent.
