    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses Kaizen, a concept associated with continuous improvement, but it is framed within the context of Kanban rather than Scrum. There are no direct mentions of Scrum roles, events, or artifacts, and the discussion lacks depth regarding Scrum principles or practices. The focus on Kaizen detracts from its relevance to the Scrum category.",
