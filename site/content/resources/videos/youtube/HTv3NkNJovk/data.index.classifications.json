    "reasoning": "Ethos is not named but is explored implicitly via discussions of authentic, system-wide agility versus leader-driven outcomes. The content contrasts Jobs's top-down approach with Nadella's system-wide change, empowerment, and sustained agility. It evidences ethos by showing real behavioural outcomes (decision decentralization, continuous improvement, changes in incentives, and feedback loops). The audience is practitioners and leaders. There is some promotional/filler content at the end, but most of the article thoroughly examines the shift in organizational behavior and values as evidenced by outcome and system practices, not just surface claims or rituals.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content strongly explores how ethos distinguishes sustainable agile leadership, using Nadella's approach as a model. It aligns well with the category by showing system-level beliefs in action rather than mere claims, though the term 'ethos' isn’t used and some segments are promotional.",

Explicit discussion of customer satisfaction, value creation, and empirical process align well with key topics in the Customer Focus category. However, the main theme is agile leadership comparison, with Customer Focus as a major but not singular aspect, limiting directness and overriding depth.

There is notable depth as practices are illustrated through real organizational impacts. The content is clearly aimed at agile leaders, practitioners, and strategists, which fits the Agentic Engineering audience.
