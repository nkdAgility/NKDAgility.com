so why is Satya Nadella a better example of agile leadership than Steve Jobs? that's a great question. um so it's going to be very contentious because of the number of people that really like Steve and Steve was great Steve Jobs was some fantastic for Apple but I think the difficulty that you see the difficulty that he created at Apple and you see it today and that's that um when Steve was running Apple everything was awesome they were innovative creating new ideas but they weren't really he was he he was driving those that innovation and those changes with with almost like an iron fist and the way treated people was was very very very bad from the measure of today right kind of toxic working environment um but he was an Apple that was successful he left Apple or he got ousted by the by the board I think it was then not successful they brought him back it was successful he died and then Apple started to lose their innovation edge so there was no sustained inbuilt innovation systemically across the organization it was all in that pyramid structure of command and control whereas when when when Satya Nadella took over Microsoft he started and it takes time in organizations of that scale and that history he started making changes to the organization to um effectively but again I know everybody says this right but responsibility down the organization so that the people doing the work have more say in how the work is done and you can see that across lots of lots of different parts of the business I mean the the the the the the windows team and the um Azure DevOps team are teams that I've worked with a little bit with the teams team um and they're a lot more innovative it's innovation across the board so everybody and all of the teams is responsible for coming up with ideas and uh trying to implement them and figuring out what the smallest thing they can change is but the real um the real the real push comes from the non-logical systemic changes that are starting to happen across the business so for for example they used to measure the Azure sales folks they would get bonus to based on the number of hours of Azure that they sold and what they found was they would have unhappy customers because customers would buy a million hours of Azure for the year because the salesperson was great and managed to sell them on it and all the cool things they would use it for and the ideas and all of those things and then at the end of the year they would get their bill for them for the million hours of Azure and realised that they'd only used 50,000 of those million hours but they still have to pay for them um so so so that's a focus on as a business on revenue extraction versus value creation the customer didn't get value from that transaction or a small amount of value compared to what they paid whereas a small change in the way you measure the sales folks and what they did was they changed the Salesforce bonuses from sale sales to usage so the sales folks now get their bonus based on the amount of Azure hours that their customers use which means the salesperson is now not the person who's got the biggest gift of the passer to get clinched the sale and get the deal they're the person who can long term engage with the customer and help them get better at using the thing you're trying to sell so that they get more value from it so they would do things like I've done engagements where somebody in Microsoft sales has hired me to come in and talk to the customer about getting better at DevOps and the benefits they would get from it in order to increase the level of DevOps and adaption and change in in the customer because that sales person knew that that company's operations team couldn't keep up with the need for change therefore they would then have to utilise services in Azure therefore they would get more bonus right so the you're turning the negative behaviour measure into a positive behaviour measure right the salesperson gets their bonus but the customer also gets the value and you're starting to see that change in other parts of the business as well as they go through and figure out what does this actually mean to us what does this change in outlook change in attitude and part of this comes from it's Satya is an incredibly pragmatic guy he's uh he's an engineer in background so he's built products he understands the difficulty of being um building products and having those things imposed and he understands the power of the people that are in his organisation that they're the ones that are important to the business they're the ones that are driving it and it's not just a Satya versus um uh Steve Jobs idea you can see it in the way Richard Branson approaches his his his companies he talks about his job is not to look after customers his job is to look after his employees their jobs to look after the customers he doesn't have to worry about that because if they're happy they'll do that job and do it well um and there's a huge switch at the moment from I feel like from um in leadership styles from this idea of stuff focused leadership to people focused leadership right instead of focusing on more stuff more money for the shareholders more money for uh uh them um more output of products they're starting to focus on um how do we enable the people in our organisation to maximise the value that we deliver so that our customers trust us over the long term and and Simon Sinek talks about this a lot he talks about moving from the finite game to the infinite game if you're playing a finite game you there's a moment where um we all start count up score and find out who wins right that's a finite game all of all of my board games are finite games they have a set of rules we all play by the same rules a point in time where we stop and find out who wins but the infinite game is how businesses run businesses run on the infinite game there's no point in time where we all stop the whole world doesn't stop we can't have score and see who's who's who's who's won in that world it will continue on infinitely so that that's that that that focus on people that focus on leadership that focus on the long-term vision of the company and the products is is is that long-term infinite focus and that for me is the big difference between um Steve Jobs and Satya Nadella and it's actually the same difference between um um Balmer uh Steve Balmer previous CEO at Microsoft and Satya as well.
