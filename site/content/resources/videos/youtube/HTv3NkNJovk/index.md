# Why is Satya Nadella a better example of agile leadership than Steve Jobs?

In #scrum, there is a great deal of emphasis on the importance of having a great #productowner. Someone who acts like the CEO of the product and sets a strong vision  for the product that inspires the #scrumteam to dig deep and create a product or features that truly delight customers.

Outside of #scrum or #agile environments, we tend to look at powerful CEOs who had an inspired vision for the future, combined with a powerful way of bringing people together to create that product or service in meaningful, inspiring ways.

So, if we look at 2 of the most powerful CEOs over the past couple of decades, Satya Nadella from Microsoft and Steve Jobs from Apple, how do they compare?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about why he thinks Satya Nadella is a better example of #agileleadership than Steve Jobs.
