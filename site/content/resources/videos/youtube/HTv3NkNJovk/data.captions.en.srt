1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:14,219
so why is Satya nadala a better example

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,260
of agile leadership than Steve Jobs

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,859
that's a great question

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,859
um so

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,859
it's going to be very contentious

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,560
because of the the number of people that

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,840
that really like Steve

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,240
and Steve was great Steve Jobs was some

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,300
fantastic for Apple but I think the

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,620
difficulty that you s you see the

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:42,000
difficulty that that he created at Apple

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,000
and you see it today and that's that

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,460
um when Steve was running Apple

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,379
everything was awesome

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,320
they were innovative

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,320
creating new ideas

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,199
but they weren't really he was

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,539
he he was driving those that Innovation

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,539
and those changes with with almost like

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,439
an Iron Fist and the way treated people

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,560
was was very very very bad from the

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,799
measure of today right kind of toxic

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,700
working environment

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,560
um

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,100
but he was an apple that was successful

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
he left apple or he got ousted by the by

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,360
the the board I think it was then not

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,939
successful they brought him back it was

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,939
successful he died and then Apple

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,060
started to lose their Innovation Edge

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,619
so there was no

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,560
sustained

33
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:39,000
inbuilt Innovation

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,460
systemically across the organization it

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,560
was all in that pyramid structure of

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,340
command and control

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,979
whereas when when when Satya Nadella

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,619
took over Microsoft

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,840
he started and it takes time in

40
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,780
organizations of that scale and that

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,299
history he started making changes to the

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,000
organization to

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,219
um effectively but again I know

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,079
everybody says this right but

45
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,119
responsibility down the organization so

46
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,400
that the people doing the work have more

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,879
say in how the work is done

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
and you can see that across lots of lots

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,180
of different parts of the business I

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,700
mean the the the the the the the windows

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,379
team and the um as your devops team are

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,500
teams that I've I've worked with a

53
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,599
little bit with the the teams team

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,360
um and they're a lot more Innovative

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,400
it's Innovation across the board so

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,040
everybody and all of the teams is is

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,620
responsible for coming up with ideas and

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,940
uh trying to implement them and figuring

59
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,879
out what the smallest thing they can

60
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,620
change is but the real

61
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,459
um

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,739
the real the real push comes from

63
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,000
the non-logical systemic changes that

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,140
are starting to happen across the

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,620
business

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,440
so for for example they used to measure

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,360
the Azure sales folks they would get

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,099
bonus to based on the number of hours of

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
azure that they sold

70
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,879
and what they found was they would have

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,459
unhappy customers because customers

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,019
would buy a million hours of azure for

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,700
the year because the salesperson was

74
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,080
great and managed to sell them on it and

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,760
all the cool things they would use it

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,560
for and the ideas and all of those

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,780
things and then at the end of the year

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,400
they would get their bill for them for

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
the million hours of azure and realized

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,239
that they'd only used 50 000 of those

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,980
millionaires but they still have to pay

82
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,860
for them

83
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,379
um so so so that's a focus on as a

84
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,300
business on Revenue extraction

85
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,220
versus value creation the customer

86
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,720
didn't get value from that transaction

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,980
or a small amount of value compared to

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,159
what they paid

89
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,560
whereas a small change in the way you

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,120
measure the sales folks and what they

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,860
did was they changed the Salesforce

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,040
bonuses from

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,019
sale sales to usage

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,180
so the sales folks now get their bonus

95
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,080
based on the amount of

96
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,819
Azure hours that their customers use

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,400
which means the sales person is now not

98
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,319
the person who's got the biggest gift of

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,080
the passer to get clinched the sale and

100
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,379
get the deal they're the person who can

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,739
long term engage with the customer and

102
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,840
help them get better at using the thing

103
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,120
you're trying to sell so that they get

104
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,060
more value from it so they would do

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,100
things like I I've done engagements

106
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,520
where somebody in Microsoft sales has

107
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,860
hired me to come in and talk to the

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,960
customer about getting better at devops

109
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,400
and the benefits they would get from it

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,759
in order to increase the level of of of

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,820
of devops and adaption and change in in

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,240
the customer because that sales person

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,220
knew that that company's operations team

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,900
couldn't keep up with the Need For

115
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,900
Change therefore they would then have to

116
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,940
utilize services in Azure therefore they

117
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,940
would get more bonus right so the you're

118
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,340
turning the negative behavior measure

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,440
into a positive behavior measure right

120
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,720
the salesperson gets their bonus but the

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,120
customer also gets the value and you're

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,919
starting to see that change in other

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,540
parts of the business as well as they go

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,000
through and figure out what does this

125
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,580
actually mean to us what does this

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,460
change in Outlook change in attitude and

127
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,100
part of this comes from it's Saturday is

128
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,680
an incredibly pragmatic guy he's uh he's

129
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,960
uh he's an engineer in background so

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,300
he's built products he understands the

131
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,639
difficulty of being

132
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,199
um building products and having those

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,720
things imposed and he understands

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,419
the power of the people that are in his

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,800
organization that they're the ones that

136
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,900
are important to the business they're

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,259
the ones that are driving it and it's

138
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,620
not just a Satya versus

139
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,020
um uh Steve Jobs idea you can see it in

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,539
the way Richard Branson approaches his

141
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,000
his his his

142
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:02,100
companies he talks about his job is not

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,080
to look after customers his job is to

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,000
look after his employees their jobs to

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,259
look after the customers he doesn't have

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
to worry about that because if they're

147
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,380
happy they'll do that job and do it well

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,620
um and there's a huge

149
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,539
switch at the moment from I feel like

150
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,520
from

151
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,919
um

152
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,380
in leadership styles from this idea of

153
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,300
stuff focused leadership to people

154
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,639
focused leadership

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,919
right instead of focusing on more stuff

156
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,460
more money for the shareholders more

157
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,400
money for uh uh them

158
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,319
um more output of products they're

159
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,020
starting to focus on

160
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,080
um how do we enable the people in our

161
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,139
organization to maximize the value that

162
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,660
we deliver so that our customers trust

163
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,000
us over the long term and and Simon

164
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,180
seniak talks about this a lot he talks

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,340
about moving from the finite game to the

166
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,400
infinite game if you're playing a finite

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,919
game you you there's a moment where

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,740
um we all start count up score and find

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,539
out who wins right that's a finite game

170
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,979
all of all of my board games are finite

171
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,900
games they have a set of rules we all

172
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,060
play by the same rules a point in time

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,979
where we stop and find out who wins but

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,539
the infinite game is how businesses run

175
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,220
businesses run on the infinite game

176
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,800
there's no point in time where we all

177
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,479
stop the whole world doesn't stop we

178
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,000
can't have score and see who's who's

179
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,819
who's who's who's won in that world it

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,520
will will continue on infinitely so that

181
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:38,759
that's that that that focus on people

182
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,340
that focus on leadership that focus on

183
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,780
the long-term vision of the company and

184
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,660
the products

185
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,699
is is is that long-term infinite focus

186
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,259
and that for me is the big difference

187
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,660
between

188
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,120
