1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,120
so the first in our series of harbingers

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,599
of the agile

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,920
apocalypse um is is really about the

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:23,279
Antichrist what what is the

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,439
Antichrist of um agile and I think um if

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119
you've been following me at all you'll

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,039
know exactly what my answer is going to

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,440
be um and that's that um Alpha

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,640
organizational structure the traditional

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,800
management structure in

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,120
organizations um that create an

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,320
environments within which you have uh uh

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,360
that that steering from the top right so

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,760
you've got the the market at the bottom

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,440
where we're interacting directly between

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,559
the people in the company and the

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,160
customers and then you've got this

18
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,519
hierarchy up the organization to

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,760
somebody who's the decision maker um or

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,760
makes decisions or needs approval for

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,920
something or whatever that is that's one

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,479
of the facets of the the alpha

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,960
organization where

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,159
um that type

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,119
of model organizational model um

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,920
inhibits the ability of the organization

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,079
to move towards agility um you you can

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,280
absolutely get little wins right you can

29
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,399
make things a little bit better you can

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,360
improve your time to Market you can

31
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,439
improve um the ability of the teams to

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,479
deliver right so a team could be doing

33
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,399
continuous

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,280
delivery um you can you can do all of

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,880
those

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,040
things to make the team as effective as

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,280
possible but

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,520
ultimately within that traditional

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,079
organizational structure you're not

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,759
going to be able to have a product owner

41
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,560
who decides what it is we're working on

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,520
that looks at Market looks at budget

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
engages with customers

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,000
um decides what and when to release um

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,080
decides what we're going to build where

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,599
are we going to invest money in this

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,000
product where are we not going to invest

48
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,959
money what's our pricing strategy for

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,319
our product those are all things that

50
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,720
are often decided far higher up the

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:29,160
organization so as organizations flow

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,120
from uh um the alpha model of of top-

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,840
down commanding control I mean it's not

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,239
it's commanding controls oversimplifying

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,959
it right but that top down uh uh uh uh

56
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,879
steering based style

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,800
towards a more uh uh beta

58
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,560
democratized uh

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,400
self-organizing um format more of a sale

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,000
based structure that is able to interact

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,519
directly with the market as they move

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,680
towards that you'll start to see more

63
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,360
and more benefits in the organization

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,120
but what happens in most organizations

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,000
is the the the the Antichrist blocks it

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,680
this Alpha topown organization where uh

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,400
somebody says uh no I'm not going to

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,760
approve that or um you need to get my

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,840
approval for all of those things or um I

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,400
don't know any of these things that just

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,120
get in the way and mean that the

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,680
organization never crosses that line and

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,640
starts its Journey towards uh a

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,599
decentralization right they never start

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,519
making that Journey towards

76
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,040
decentralization because we work this

77
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,400
way this is our hierarchy this is how we

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,959
do things um and that is the killer to

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,840
Agile in your

80
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
