    "reasoning": "The content focuses on challenges posed by hierarchical structures to organizational agility and offers strategies for decentralization and empowering teams. Nowhere does it mention OKRs, Objectives, Key Results, or the specific philosophy, structure, or implementation of Objective Key Results as defined by John Doerr. There are tangential alignments—discussion of transparency, focus on customer value, and iterative improvement (some of OKR's superpowers)—but these are presented exclusively in the context of organizational structure and agile team empowerment, not as part of an OKR system or discussion. Audience and intent are somewhat adjacent to the OKR category, but the content lacks both explicit and substantive engagement with OKRs.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses organizational structure and agile principles but does not mention, discuss, or explore Objective Key Results. Its focus and intent are unrelated to OKRs, making alignment minimal despite vague thematic overlaps around transparency and agility.",

    "reasoning": "The content strongly aligns with key Agentic Engineering themes by critiquing centralized, rigid structures and advocating for decentralization, team empowerment, and feedback-driven adaptation—core category pillars. It thoroughly discusses systemic barriers to agency, the necessity of distributed decision-making, and servant leadership, but does not specifically mention Agentic Engineering or expand on AI agency, observability, or automation. The intended audience, tone, and focus are well-matched with the category, but the superficial mention of 'agency' concepts (e.g., team autonomy, leadership models) keeps the 'direct mention' score low. No penalties applied, as the content is timely, supportive, and never contradictory.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece addresses decentralization and team empowerment in software organizations, closely matching Agentic Engineering's focus on maximizing human agency. Though it doesn't mention the category explicitly or explore AI agency, its strategies and philosophy are highly relevant for practitioners pursuing agentic practices.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on organizational structure barriers to agility, advocating for decentralization and empowerment of teams, but at no point does it reference autonomous AI agents, agentic design, or the integration of contextual AI in software delivery. There are no explicit or implicit mentions of agentic systems or intelligence, nor does it cover engineering practices, governance, or AI support mechanisms critical to 'Agentic Software Delivery.' The intent is to provide advice on agile transformation at the organizational level, not on enabling agentic approaches. While relevant for practitioners, there is no tie-in with the technological or agency-centric aspects needed for this category. Small signal is relevant due to the focus and minimal off-topic content.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about shifting from hierarchical to agile teams—organizational empowerment, not agentic software delivery. No mention or exploration of AI agents, agentic integration, or related engineering practice. Does not fit category definition.",
