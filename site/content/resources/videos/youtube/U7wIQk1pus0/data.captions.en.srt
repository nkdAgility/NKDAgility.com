1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so I just got asked if I had a basic

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,280
blog post for installing um TFS 2013 I

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,080
realized that I hadn't really done a

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,440
basic out of the box install and since

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,880
probably 2010 most of the time I've been

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,480
doing upgrades so on my Surface I'm

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,880
going to create a new virtual

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,640
machine and I already have a domain

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
controller running

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,480
now we need to set this um at a minimum

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,440
of 248 for memory I'm going to use

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,559
dynamic memory so I only use as much as

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,680
I need once the machine's running and

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,960
but TFS does a check for the amount of

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
memory in a machine and and if this

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,199
isn't set to 2048 will not be able to

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,000
install TFS so that's the minimum you

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,119
need but it can be actually like L based

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,119
on dynamic

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,119
memory

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,280
private let me select now I'm going to

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
use a Windows Server 2012

23
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,960
R2 there we

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
go so I'm going to start this machine

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,840
well I just going to connect to it and

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,240
then start

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,840
it now this is just going to do a a

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,840
basic vanilla install of

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:41,200
windows I will need to go and get a

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,200
key let me do that while we're

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
waiting

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
oh

33
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,799
awesome so I'm just going to use um

34
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,159
Windows Server

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,119
2012 R2 standard

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,119
and paste in my

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,440
key there we go so we don't want our

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,680
core installation TFS is not currently

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,640
supported on core um it mostly works

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,720
there's just a couple of things that

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,959
don't particular around build servers um

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,959
so I'm going to pick with a

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,480
guey now I obviously can't upgrade it's

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,480
a blank install so and I just do that

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,599
there we go that's going to copy the uh

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,080
files do the install uh reboot and that

47
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,040
will get

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,040
going so now that we have it

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
installed wait it's just took a minute

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,519
not time to go and get a coffee

51
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,879
so that's me logging in for the first

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
time yep and now I can get a proper

53
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,879
resolution

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:16,640
awesome if you're using Windows

55
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:19,080
8.1 and uh uh server uh 2012 R2 you get

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,920
this enhanced session mode that allows

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,720
you to not only copy paste uh but set

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,680
the resolution a little bit more nicely

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,680
and all kinds of stuff been

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,519
so if you've used server or server uh

61
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,400
any of the newer server

62
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,840
versions We fig a

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,840
minute you will

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,360
know that it just picks a random

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,599
computer name and you have to change it

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,159
so I don't really want that as the

67
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,519
computer

68
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,239
name so I'm going to change

69
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,400
that

70
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,360
btar and I'm going to have to reboot

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,519
that uh

72
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,519
first before I do anything

73
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,400
else give it a

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
sec

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,600
go so now we have a machine Co

76
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,680
btar let me just check settings and

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,880
everything think the network

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,639
is ah see I've just got it set as

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,800
private and One

80
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,680
processor change that over to

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,240
Wi-Fi but I will need private as well

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,240
okay so let me just

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
quickly

84
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,639
uh's shut this

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,440
down there we go change the

86
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,440
settings I'm going to get two processors

87
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,960
I'm going to

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,720
add a network

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,880
adapter private Network there we

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,800
go that should make it one run a little

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,479
bit

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:23,800
faster and uh to be able to connect

93
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,800
to private

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Network awesome

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,199
okay I need to set up my private

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,360
Network and

97
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,360
these let me just do

98
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,680
okay so now I have that set up I should

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,680
be able to change my work

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,560
group to in. nm.com should

101
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,640
my domain

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,199
should find my

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,199
[Music]

104
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,199
domain

105
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,560
um we should be good I want to do the

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,479
install on a domain cuz that's more uh a

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,199
better example of what people would do

108
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,759
in the field uh most people don't

109
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,759
install TFS in a work group so um that's

110
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,639
what I'm going to

111
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,639
do just give that a minute to join

112
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
there we

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,879
go and we just need to do a quick

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,879
restart and then we can install TFS

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:54,919
perfect now all we need to do is install

116
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,919
TFS so let me insert my TFS

117
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,440
dis this is just the RTM of a team

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Foundation

119
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,720
server so this is a completely blank

120
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,720
server we've just joined it to a domain

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,520
we don't have anything else installed on

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,120
it and you may want to install SQL

123
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,680
Server to get the full version of uh of

124
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,840
SQL server and TFS actually includes a

125
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
license for SQL Server standard and so

126
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,080
you can just install that and you don't

127
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,319
need an additional license as long as

128
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,599
it's only used for TF

129
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,599
but I'm just going to continue with

130
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,880
Express and TFS will install at SQL

131
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,360
Express as part of the the installation

132
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,720
once we got get to the configuration

133
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,399
part so and the first part of the TFS

134
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,320
installation just gets all the files on

135
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,680
disk registers all of the the the dlls

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,839
and does all of those um local piec that

137
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,760
you need to do but it's not going to um

138
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,480
install any of the third party tools

139
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
it's not going to configure anything yet

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,720
we're going to do that in a minute there

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,160
we go in just a few minutes it's

142
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,600
installed TFS I'm just going to do a

143
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,640
trial install just now let me activate

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,240
that there we

145
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,480
go and I get my standard installation

146
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,040
wizard now there's a number of options

147
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,079
here um the standard server and if you

148
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,240
want to use default instance of SQL

149
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,560
Server um but this will not work for uh

150
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,079
um SQL

151
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Express and won't configure reporting

152
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,040
services and the reporting pieces for

153
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,519
you we have a advanced where you can

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,600
configure um all of the the SQL Server

155
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,440
databases SharePoint um SQL server and

156
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,680
ala Services Services all those pieces

157
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,640
very easily and I'm actually just going

158
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,160
to take a basic install so this is going

159
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,320
to install Express it's going to um

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,360
configure work atem tracking build

161
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,519
Services Source control all of those

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,360
things are going to be configured for us

163
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,839
and up and running at the end and but we

164
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,120
won't have um anything else we won't

165
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,160
have SharePoint integration we won't

166
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
have reporting Services integration and

167
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,440
and we can't do any kind of nonstandard

168
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,880
configurations with this mode so let me

169
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,880
just start

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,320
Wizard and the first thing it's going to

171
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,320
do is going to install

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
Express and it's going to go in away and

173
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,160
check my system and make sure

174
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,000
everything's running okay so this is

175
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,320
going to check for prerequisites it's

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,959
going to check to make sure that it can

177
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,480
install stuff there can always be

178
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,639
something extra that goes wrong but it

179
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,920
does a pretty good job of checking the

180
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,240
system requirements so you can see

181
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,680
everything's okay it's also going to

182
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,079
install uh IIs fancy name for I um and

183
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,920
make sure everything's good so if I

184
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,040
click configure it's going to go off and

185
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,320
do that it will take a few minutes

186
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,560
specifically for cons configuring IIs

187
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,200
installing um SQL Express will take a

188
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,160
little bit longer than everything else

189
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,160
um but it should only take a few

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,920
minutes awesome so we've got an

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,560
install it's complete and we can just go

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,800
to

193
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,800
hopefully I like we need to log

194
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,000
in a tap

195
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,560
[Music]

196
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,279
there we go connected to

197
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,680
TFS I currently have one collection with

198
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,040
no team

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,959
projects so I will need to set that up

200
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
but I don't have real to do on here so I

201
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,160
will do that later and there you go

202
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,560
installing configuring TFS very

203
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,560
straightforward um on a basic server

204
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
configuration
