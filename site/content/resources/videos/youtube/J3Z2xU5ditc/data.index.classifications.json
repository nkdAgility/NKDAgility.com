Nowhere does the article directly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it reference key SLE concepts such as cycle time forecasts, elapsed time ranges, probabilities of completion, calculation using historical data, or the application of SLE for flow management or predictability. The closest conceptual alignment is the discussion of predictability and planning, but these are general and not mapped to SLE practices, theory, or terminology. The audience is Agile practitioners, which has mild overlap with the SLE category, but the article is not targeted at teams looking to understand or implement SLE. There is no signal of SLE application, calculation, intent, or authoritative references. The focus is entirely on planning within Scrum and Agile at both small and large scale, making it outside the SLE category as defined by the strict classification, aside from broad relevance to Agile topics. No penalties were applied, as the article is not outdated or critical of the SLE concept; it is simply off-topic relative to this classification.",
