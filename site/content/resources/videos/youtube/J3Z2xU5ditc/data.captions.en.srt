1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,360
one of the common myths in scrum is that

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:14,080
since we're doing agile we don't need no

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,560
planning um and that is just utter

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,600
garbage scrum for example is all about

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,640
planning we have Sprint planning we have

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,320
refinement which is a type of planning

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,840
we have uh daily scrum which is about

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,119
planning the next 24 hours we have a

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,800
review where we riew what happened based

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,120
on the plan and adapt the plan going

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,440
forward into the future it's it's all

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,440
about planning it's all about getting

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,840
things right it's not about planning

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:50,960
upfront it's not about

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:55,039
spending too much time upfront planning

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,559
okay but there's a phrase which is often

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,039
misinterpreted which is we should do

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:04,199
just enough planning we should do just

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,080
enough right if we do too much planning

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,080
and we plan a bunch of stuff that we end

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,880
up not doing because it gets taken out

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,920
of the out of the backlog then that was

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,960
waste maybe that was okay waste maybe we

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
needed to do that planning in order to

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,640
find out other stuff and have that thing

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,600
removed or maybe that was a little bit

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
too much was is there a way that we

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,960
could have learned the same thing that

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,040
we learned doing that planning doing

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:36,000
something a little bit less

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,119
and the converse of that is if you are

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,119
building I'm trying to think what you

33
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,960
could be building that needs lots of

34
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,799
let's say you're working on

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,799
Windows and you're one of 2 and a half

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,399
th000 software Engineers how many teams

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,479
is that metric assloads of teams right

38
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,280
if you you're that many teams working on

39
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,719
one product then you're going to need to

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,759
plan

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,560
right you're going to need to understand

42
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,320
what's happening going out into the

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,520
future you're going to need to

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,879
coordinate across hundreds of teams on

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,400
Direction and strategy I mean most of

46
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,319
that in scrum is done through

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,920
communication right Vision product goal

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
Sprint goal right you've got that

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,080
communication chain how do we all get

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,319
behind the same thing but we're trying

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,560
to

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,720
have as

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,879
light a plan upfront as possible within

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,920
our

55
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:45,080
context so even even if I was working on

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,000
the Windows team I would probably have a

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,120
a road map I'm probably going to have a

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,800
road map for my current six months if

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,080
you're not familiar with how how

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,360
Microsoft product teams have they've

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,480
created their own scaling framework

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,080
around what they need and their business

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,680
um it's often called the season-based

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,040
model cuz they do they talk about the

65
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,239
spring update and the fall update for

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,720
their really big products U many of

67
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,720
their products do continuous delivery

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
but they're talking about long-term view

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,120
of what it is they're trying to achieve

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
and that's that's about 6 months and

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,640
they look three seasons ahead so they're

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,840
looking 18 months out they have an 18

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,200
month plan and I'm using air quotes

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,159
because it's probably pretty vague right

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,360
if you're looking looking at that third

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:41,720
season out things are really big right

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,360
you might have um uh uh uh uh themes

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,959
rather than individual things you're

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,200
going to deliver you might be looking at

80
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,400
what are the investment opportunities

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,120
what's happening in the market where do

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,360
we need to to get ahead of the of the

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,159
competition going over the next 18

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,319
months and that generates these big

85
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,079
theme

86
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,640
buckets of work that many hundreds of

87
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,599
teams might work in um to to actually

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,760
you know make progress towards those big

89
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,120
themes but you're looking that far out

90
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,600
you're planning that far out you know um

91
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,759
probably what your goal your product

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,000
goal if if they call I don't think they

93
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,199
call it that but whatever their their

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,320
theme for uh their primary theme for us

95
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,919
each of the seasons they probably know

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,280
what they're going to be 18 months out

97
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,080
for the season that we're in you know

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,039
we're probably got backlog items and

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,199
actual things we're going to tactically

100
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,440
deliver for the next three four maybe

101
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,360
five Sprints

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,919
maybe and then in the next bucket we

103
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,199
maybe have you know here's some Sprint

104
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,160
goals we might tackle here's some

105
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,080
product goals we might look at um in

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,520
that next seasonal bucket and then the

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,639
season after after

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,360
that we we don't have any of those

109
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,280
detailed just what's the big theme and

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,560
you can you can see how they did that

111
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,639
they they did a uh one recently uh I'm

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,000
saying recently in The Last 5 Years

113
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,039
right uh recently that was called the

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,520
creators update so when they when they

115
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,199
were talking to us the general public

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,560
about the products they talked about the

117
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,120
creators update we're going to invest in

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,039
opportunities to make our systems and

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,440
products and services better for

120
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,319
creators that was an organization wide

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,800
uh theme that kind of spawned out of the

122
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,479
windows team but think of all the things

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,199
that impacts not only does that impact

124
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,560
on Windows the operating system right

125
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,600
but what about offices impact most

126
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,039
people interact with the operating

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,039
system through off office so if you're

128
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,720
to hey fever if you're talking about um

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,080
pen support right you've got the the the

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,039
the actual pen touching the screen on

131
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,000
the surface and the number of levels of

132
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,960
capability that it has in that world

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
you've got so that's that's hardware

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,919
that's the surface hardware and perhaps

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
thirdparty vendor Hardware collaborating

136
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,400
with then you've got the application

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,360
that you're actually is interpreting

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,080
those signals so that could be

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,440
Microsoft's applications it could be

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,120
office it could be third party software

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,720
and then you've got the underlying

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,680
operating system which is providing

143
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,759
support for the I think it used to be

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,199
250 6 uh levels of pressure and now it's

145
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,240
uh 1024 at least uh uh levels of

146
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,759
pressure that you can put on the pen in

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,000
order to to to get that you know I'm

148
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,720
drawing on the page type of type of feel

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
and that

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,080
requires collaboration looking forward

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,720
into the future what do we need what are

152
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,199
we trying to achieve all of those

153
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,000
strategic things are happening we just

154
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,599
probably don't store them in a Gant
