One of the most pervasive myths I encounter in the world of Scrum is the notion that Agile means we can forgo planning altogether. This idea is not just misguided; it’s downright detrimental to the success of any Agile team. Let me clarify: Scrum is fundamentally about planning. 

### The Importance of Planning in Scrum

In Scrum, we have several key events that revolve around planning:

- **Sprint Planning**: This is where we define what we aim to achieve in the upcoming sprint.
- **Refinement**: Often overlooked, this is a crucial type of planning where we prepare our backlog items for future sprints.
- **Daily Scrum**: This daily meeting is all about planning our next 24 hours and ensuring we’re aligned.
- **Sprint Review**: Here, we assess what we accomplished based on our initial plan and adapt our strategy moving forward.

So, when someone says we don’t need planning in Agile, I can’t help but shake my head. It’s not about eliminating planning; it’s about planning effectively and efficiently.

### Just Enough Planning

You may have heard the phrase “just enough planning.” This concept is often misinterpreted. The goal is not to eliminate planning but to find the right balance. If we over-plan and end up with items that are removed from the backlog, we’ve wasted time and resources. However, sometimes that planning is necessary to uncover insights that lead to better decisions down the line.

Conversely, if you’re part of a large team—say, working on a product like Windows with thousands of engineers—you’ll need a robust planning strategy. Coordination across numerous teams is essential for maintaining direction and strategy. 

### Planning in Large Teams

In such expansive environments, communication becomes paramount. Here’s how it typically works:

- **Vision and Product Goals**: These guide the entire team and ensure everyone is aligned.
- **Roadmaps**: Even in large teams, having a roadmap for the next six months is crucial. This helps in visualising the direction and objectives.

For instance, Microsoft employs a season-based model for their product teams, where they plan for three seasons ahead—roughly 18 months out. This long-term view allows them to identify major themes and investment opportunities, which is vital for staying competitive.

### The Role of Themes in Planning

When looking at the future, especially 18 months out, the specifics can be vague. Instead of detailed tasks, teams often focus on broader themes. For example, during the Creators Update, Microsoft communicated a clear organisational theme aimed at enhancing products for creators. This theme not only influenced Windows but also had implications for Office and hardware like the Surface.

This kind of strategic planning requires collaboration across various teams and disciplines. It’s about understanding what’s needed to achieve overarching goals and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

### Conclusion

In summary, planning is not the enemy of Agile; it’s a vital component of it. The key is to strike a balance—plan enough to provide direction without getting bogged down in unnecessary details.
