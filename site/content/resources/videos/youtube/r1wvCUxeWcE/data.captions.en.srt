1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,000
really important part of visualizing

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,120
your work when you're doing caman is

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,240
having some kind of caman board okay uh

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,480
you want to take the way your system

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,400
currently operates you want to think

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,439
about the things that move across your

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,519
board things that will move through your

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,800
system and then decide what are the

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,199
columns that that needs to move through

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,520
now the absolutely most optimal way to

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,239
do that would be single piece flow one

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,879
item at a time to do in progress and

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,920
done but the reality is we don't all

14
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,680
live in that perfect world in fact none

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,399
of us do so you're going to have to look

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,640
at how your work flows through your

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,120
system what are the columns that you

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,520
currently have on your board with the

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,520
stages of the work and come up with a

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,520
board that represents that
