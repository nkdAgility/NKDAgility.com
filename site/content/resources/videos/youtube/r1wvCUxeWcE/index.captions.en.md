Really important part of visualising your work when you're doing Kanban is having some kind of Kanban board. Okay, you want to take the way your system currently operates. You want to think about the things that move across your board, things that will move through your system, and then decide what are the columns that need to move through.

Now, the absolutely most optimal way to do that would be single piece flow: one item at a time to do, in progress, and done. But the reality is we don't all live in that perfect world; in fact, none of us do. So you're going to have to look at how your work flows through your system. What are the columns that you currently have on your board with the stages of the work? Come up with a board that represents that.
