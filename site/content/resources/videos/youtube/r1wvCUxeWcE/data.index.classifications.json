    "reasoning": "The content is an in-depth guide about Kanban board setup and workflow visualisation for process improvement. It does not reference agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, their integration with human expertise, or context-aware intelligence. While it promotes continuous improvement and workflow analysis, none of its themes, intent, or audience focus maps to agentic software delivery principles or practices. The content is aimed at teams/practitioners improving visualization and efficiency; there is no mention or implication of AI, automation with contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery evolution. Thus, the fit is minimal.",
