1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,200
so the initial response to the immersive

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,620
learning has been

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,540
incredibly positive almost every single

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,900
pair I can't think of anybody I've

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,520
spoken to that have said uh well that

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,619
sounds like it sucks I'd rather do a

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,720
two-day class or nobody said that

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,140
everybody

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,900
detests uh at the full today uh

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,940
full-time two-day workshop I I don't

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,620
know I don't know why we kept doing it

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,239
for so long actually I do know why we

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,120
kept doing it for so long it's because

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,820
we insisted on trainers going on site to

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,320
do it which means that you have to do it

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,879
in a short period of time because the

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,120
company that you work for doesn't want

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,980
to pay for me in a hotel for six weeks

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
uh and all all the stuff that that

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
entails in order to be able to deliver a

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,620
six week Workshop right

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,899
um so we need to compress it into a

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,559
short period of time now in the virtual

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,719
space we're free to experiment with

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,880
different formats different ways of

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,860
engaging with students and it's really

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,900
resonating with the people

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,479
um that are thinking about taking the

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,360
class or or wanting to be part of it and

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,880
we've already had uh customers express

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,580
interest we've had customers buy onto

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,759
especially the pspo has been hugely

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,619
popular because they're really

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,280
interested in that continuous

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,680
development right that conversation that

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,420
you have over a longer period of time so

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,180
that you're not just

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,299
here's a bunch of content

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,320
bye that's it that's that's a two-day

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,360
class right this is this is uh more

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,159
here's here's a bunch of here's a little

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
bit of content

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,920
and here's something to try in your

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,500
business

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,479
go try it come back next week and let's

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,560
have a chat about it how did you get on

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,259
how did it work what happened and that

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,600
piece

49
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,600
businesses especially small to

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,720
medium-sized businesses

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,400
really see that Value Extra Value that

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,920
they get for it

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,900
for really not that much extra cost

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,319
right

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,420
um it's it's spreading that out over a

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,920
longer period of Time closing those

57
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,980
feedback loops uh getting people really

58
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,599
embedded embedding those ideas not oh my

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,500
favorite expression

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,180
um

61
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,060
that actually uh uh uh uh one of my good

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,940
friends Jim uh mentioned is that

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,300
um a job as a trainer is to plant seeds

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,920
right seeds of ideas that are then going

65
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,599
to grow into something

66
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,160
and one of the problems with the two-day

67
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,200
format is you're planting a whole bunch

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,379
of seeds and you don't know what's going

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,420
to grow and nobody's coming back to

70
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,940
water those seeds or care for them right

71
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,580
that's just self-service you've seeds

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,099
are on your own figuring out how to how

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,239
to how to expand that whereas this

74
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,099
format is the gardeners coming back

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,440
tending all of the the different plants

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,819
the different seeds you know if these

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,739
plants in this area aren't getting

78
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,440
enough water they can spend more time on

79
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,180
that and that really gets those thought

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,140
processes going I'm really looking

81
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,180
