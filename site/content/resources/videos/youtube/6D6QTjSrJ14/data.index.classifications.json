It emphasises the importance of feedback loops, continuous development, and the role of trainers in nurturing ideas, which aligns well with the themes of team dynamics, communication, and process improvement. The depth of discussion on how these changes impact learning and collaboration within teams further supports its relevance to the 'People and Process' category.",
