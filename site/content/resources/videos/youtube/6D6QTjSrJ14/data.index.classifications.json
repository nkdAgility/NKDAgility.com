    "final_score": 35.0,
    "reasoning": "The content discusses immersive learning and its advantages while emphasizing ongoing dialogue, feedback loops, and real-time collaboration. However, it primarily focuses on the methodology rather than specific principles that guide Agile, Lean, or DevOps frameworks. While aspects like continuous improvement and adaptability are touched upon, they are not a primary focus of the content or tied to actionable principles in a specific framework. Therefore, the overall confidence score reflects a moderate connection to the category 'Principle' but does not fully satisfy the criteria for strong alignment.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses immersive learning in a way that touches upon the evolution of professional development methods, which could imply some alignment with the concept of Discipline. However, it focuses primarily on the innovative learning techniques rather than core principles of any structured discipline like Agile or DevOps, leading to a lower confidence score. While it mentions concepts like continuous feedback and collaborative learning, these are framed more as innovative practices than as systematic applications of a discipline.",
