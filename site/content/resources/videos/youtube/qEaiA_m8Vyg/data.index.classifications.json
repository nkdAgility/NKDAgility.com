However, no mention is made of human-AI collaboration or AI agents as team members. The discussion of community is exclusively about human-human interaction, lacking any socio-technical or collective intelligence (as defined) themes, concepts, or frameworks. Audience, focus, and examples all align with general experiential learning and do not refer to AI partnership, agency, or collaboration.",

While it references continuous learning, feedback, and empirical adaptation—parallels to themes in Agentic Engineering—it never addresses the deliberate engineering of software practices, system or developer agency, or the integration of humans/AI in socio-technical contexts. No explicit or implied references to engineering, DevOps, autonomy, or ethical AI appear. The content’s intent is exclusively educational (learning theory and pedagogy), targeting trainers and learners, not engineering professionals or agents. Minor conceptual overlaps occur in empirical, feedback-driven approaches, but core category themes are largely absent, justifying a low confidence score.",
