1
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,559
of why have I decided to go all in on a

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,580
massive learning experiences I think I

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,600
think it's because that's what works

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,460
right I I feel that time and time again

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,619
I've run

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,900
um today the traditional model which is

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,140
two day or kind of four half day classes

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,120
I've run those traditional classes and I

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,880
I feel like people learned a lot of

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,680
stuff during those classes right they

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,860
absorbed a lot of stuff perhaps it

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,980
planted some seeds that will eventually

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,320
someday grow into something but if

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,600
anybody's tried to grow seeds into

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,180
plants you can't just plant the seed one

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,340
seed and hope for the best right you

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,100
kind of have to nurture it and take care

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,399
of it over a longer period of time until

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,719
it's ready to stand on its own right you

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,219
might even have that you have to put

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,199
that stick in to make sure the plant

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,159
doesn't fall over until it stems big

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,340
enough all of those those things

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,220
are what immersive learning

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,580
um provides provides that extra support

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,280
perhaps provides that longer term

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,340
continuous engagement

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,900
um that hopefully also results in more

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,780
collaboration and communication between

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,840
the people that were involved anyway so

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,900
it continues beyond that

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,079
um that immersive experience so quite

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,060
often if you just do a two-day class how

34
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,700
often do you speak to the people that

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,079
you were in that two-day class for

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,759
um after you've been in that two-day

37
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,619
class right

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,479
um I bet most people never hear from

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,340
them again never speak to them again

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,840
never even think of them again right but

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,700
um if you if you went through an

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,259
immersive experience and the immersive

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,140
experiences for different classes vary

44
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,680
right from from six weeks all the way up

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,119
till uh 10 weeks right perhaps some of

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,119
them are going to be going to be longer

47
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,860
but if you you've had to

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,959
um

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,080
collaborate over that period of time

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
go and do assignments and kind of what's

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,459
the expression

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,040
barrier all I don't know how to how to

53
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,680
describe it that that thing where

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,239
you're you're you're talking to people a

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
group of people when you're debriefing

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,360
the assignments that you've had and

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,940
you're talking about the real

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,520
experiences that you've just had trying

59
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,459
to do that you're sharing part of

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,519
yourself with this group of people and

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,099
that should build over these weeks a

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
level of camaraderie with that the rest

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,220
of your cohorts right that that group of

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,360
people who've been through that

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,560
experience

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,180
and that it should enable a much greater

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,000
likelihood of continuous collaboration

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,800
but also there's a

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,940
much greater likelihood that you've

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,459
actually learned something because

71
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,680
you're able to we're basically

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,500
implementing double Loop learning right

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,060
where where you're able to to go and try

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,220
and do the thing that you've learned in

75
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,680
the class and then

76
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,440
come back around and say was this what I

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,959
was meant to do right what is the result

78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,700
of the thing that I tried to do could I

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,739
have done this differently and got a

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,379
different result and then you're able to

81
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,319
then try it again so each of the the

82
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:31,860
different learner each week's learning

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,080
content has that Loop feedback loop

84
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,640
empirical process right bringing it into

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,739
the learning World

86
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,659
um empirical process to bring bring that

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,519
knowledge back so you can then do

88
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,159
something a little bit different and and

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,500
I think it also lends itself much more

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,500
readily to even outside of the context

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,239
of the fixed courseware right so there's

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,760
going to be an assignment at the end of

93
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,620
each session you go off and do that and

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,200
when we do a debrief when we come back

95
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,239
the outcome of that debrief might be

96
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,580
that you want to try something different

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,860
there's absolutely no reason that the

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,620
trainer wouldn't want to have a a

99
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,900
debrief of that you're trying again as

100
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,780
well as you know during the class we're

101
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,700
doing that debrief of the next exercise

102
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,260
but you want to still talk about some of

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,959
the things that you've tried differently

104
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,820
tried again in the previous exercise and

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,520
all of our trainers would be absolutely

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,960
happy to get on a call and talk about

107
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,419
that as well perhaps the whole group's

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
interested right that's something that

109
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,040
we can we can we can figure out how we

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,720
incorporate into that process so that

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,500
that idea

112
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,960
of of how do we learn how do humans

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,259
learn with

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,360
interactive continuous feedback loops of

115
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,440
those learning outcomes that's what

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
we're trying to bring into this

117
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,880
immersive learning experience and I

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,860
think again it's going to be a a a game

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,860
changer for

120
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,259
um for training and learning because you

121
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,960
it's not just a fire and forget right

122
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,479
you're not just uh getting that content

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,240
shoved into your brain and then it

124
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,880
atrophying over time uh you've actually

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
got that continuous loop back so you can

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,180
always ask that question right that

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,100
niggle that you have six weeks later

128
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,080
about something that you talked about

129
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,660
six weeks ago fine ask the question

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,060
right we're all right here we can we can

131
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,460
we can see what we think and I think

132
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,440
that's that important part that feedback

133
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,960
loop that empirical process in the

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,000
learning environment
