1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,290
Why have I decided to go all in
on immersive learning experiences?

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:18,420
I think, I think it's
because that's what works, right?

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,140
I feel that time and time
again, I've run two day,

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,130
the traditional model, which is two day
or kind of four half day classes.

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,920
I've run those traditional classes
And I feel like people learned a lot

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,320
of stuff during those classes, right?

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,480
They absorbed a lot of stuff.
Perhaps it planted some seeds

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
that will eventually
someday grow into something.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,720
But if anybody's tried
to grow seeds into plants,

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,690
you can't just plant the seed,
one seed and hope for the best, right?

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,660
You kind of have to nurture it
and take care of it over a longer period

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,030
of time until it's ready
to stand on its own, right?

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,200
You might even have that,
you have to put that stick

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,800
in to make sure the plant doesn't fall
over until it stems big enough.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:12,480
All of those things are what
immersive learning provides,

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
provides that extra support,

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,040
provides that longer
term continuous engagement

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,610
that hopefully also results
in more collaboration and communication

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,290
between the people
that were involved anyway.

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:33,080
So it continues beyond that
immersive experience.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,440
So quite often, if you just
do a two day class,

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,860
how often do you speak to the people
that you were in that two day class for?

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,330
After you've been
in that two day class, right?

24
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,290
I bet most people never hear
from them again,

25
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,900
never speak to them again,
never even think of them again,

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,770
right?

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,940
But

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,860
if you went through an
immersive experience,

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,380
and the immersive experiences
for different classes vary,

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,840
right, from six weeks all the way up
till 10 weeks, right?

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,470
Perhaps some of them
are going to be longer.

32
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,280
But if you've had to collaborate
over that period of time, go

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,740
and do assignments
and kind of, what's the expression?

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,870
Bare your all?

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,400
I don't know how to describe it.
That thing where you're talking to people,

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
a group of people, when you're
debriefing the assignments

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,090
that you've had and you're talking
about the real experiences

38
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,110
that you've just had trying to do that.

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,710
You're sharing part of yourself
with this group of people.

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,100
And that should build over these weeks,
a level of camaraderie with that, the rest

41
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,840
of your cohorts, right?
That group of people who've been

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,780
through that experience,

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,970
and that it should enable
a much greater likelihood

44
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,380
of continuous collaboration,

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,860
but also there's a much greater likelihood
that you've actually learned something

46
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,560
because you're able to...

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,300
We're basically implementing
double loop learning, right?

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,860
Where you're able to go and try
and do the thing that you've learned

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,340
in the class and then come back around
and say was this what I was meant to do,

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,110
right?

51
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,420
What is the result
of the thing that I tried to do?

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,520
Could I have done this differently
and got a different result?

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,260
And then you're able to then try it again.
So each of the different learn

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,880
each week's learning
content has that loop feedback loop,

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,390
some empirical process, right?
Bringing it into the learning world.

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,600
Empirical process
to bring that knowledge back

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,130
so you can then do something
a little bit different.

58
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,770
And I think it also lends itself
much more readily to even outside

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,030
of the context of the
fixed courseware, right?

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,170
So there's gonna be an assignment
at the end of each session.

61
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,070
You go off and do that, and then we
do a debrief when we come back.

62
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,080
The outcome of that debrief might be
that you wanna try something different.

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,400
There's absolutely no reason
that the trainer wouldn't want

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,230
to have a debrief
of that you're trying again,

65
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,800
as well as, you know,
during the class we're doing that debrief

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,540
of the next exercise,
but you want to still talk about some

67
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,880
of the things that you've
tried differently, tried again

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,960
in the previous exercise
and all of our trainers would

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,800
be absolutely happy to get
on a call and talk about that as well.

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,300
Perhaps the whole group's
interested, right?

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,180
That's something that we can
figure out how we incorporate

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,360
into that process.

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,820
So that idea

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:42,830
of how do we learn, how do humans learn
with interactive continuous feedback loops

75
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,920
of those learning outcomes,
that's what we're trying to bring

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,280
into this immersive learning experience
and I think again it's going

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600
to be a game changer

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,010
for training and learning
because it's not just a fire and forget,

79
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,260
right? You're
not just getting

80
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,320
that content shoved into your brain
and then it atrophying over time,

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,360
you've actually got that
continuous loop back.

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
So you can always ask that
question, right?

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,380
That niggle that you have
six weeks later about something

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,400
that you talked about six weeks ago.
Fine, ask the question, right?

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
We're all right here,
we can say what we think.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,120
I think that's that important part,
that feedback loop, that empirical process

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,260
in the learning environment.

88
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,780
