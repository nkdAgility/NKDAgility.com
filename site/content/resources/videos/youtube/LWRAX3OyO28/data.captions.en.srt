1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,960
if you're trying to unlock the power of

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,880
continuous delivery then you've probably

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,360
considered the type of benefits that you

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,320
get from it and perhaps perhaps they're

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,680
not the benefits you think while it is

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,039
true that continuous delivery can help

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,680
you become faster that's a lagging side

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,439
effect of um the work that you would do

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,199
the real benefit of continuous delivery

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,079
is the requirement for automation within

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,840
the context of devops and the real value

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,960
of automation within the context of

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,160
devops is you've not got a person doing

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,360
the deployment you've got an automated

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
tool during the deployment so you gain

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,960
consistency and

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,320
reliability of what is happening and

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,480
that consistency and reliability reduces

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,000
your risk if you're interested in how

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,719
much risk that is there are there's one

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,120
example that I always used to use which

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,199
was the the night Capital group which

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,879
was a a financially traded stock

24
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,799
exchange e organization in the US that

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,560
did a deployment of their software it

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,479
failed and due to various

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,000
reasons mostly to do with automated I

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,840
sorry manual deployments they ended up

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,119
losing about $10,000 an hour or a minute

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,200
or whatever it was but at the end of the

31
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,880
day they had to file for bankruptcy and

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,520
at the beginning of the day they had 450

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,439
million in the bank so that's the

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,600
example I usually use probably today I

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:39,360
would say crowd strike right if if

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,040
you've got unn automation that checks

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,439
that your system that what it is you've

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,719
created your teams have created is good

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,280
and meets the minimum bar for the

40
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,840
business right what's what's your risk

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,960
level that that's the power of

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:01,280
continuous delivery is cons consistency

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,560
and limiting risk you can

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
ensure that within your continuous

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,879
delivery

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,120
process you have the checks that you as

47
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,080
a business require to protect your

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,239
business right so there's there's

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,640
protecting your business protecting your

50
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,200
brand protecting your employees and

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,480
protecting your customers all of those

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,280
things can mostly be automated almost

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
all of those things that could possibly

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,879
go wrong can be automated you you can't

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,800
it's very difficult to automate legal

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,360
stuff so you would still have to there's

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,760
some some things in there but from the

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,159
context of I don't want my software to

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,400
fail I don't want it to send money to

60
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,800
the wrong place I don't want all of

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,400
those things we use testing we use

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,560
automation we use continuous delivery

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,959
continuous everything continuous testing

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,959
continuous deployment continuous

65
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,800
delivery right those are the things that

66
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,480
help you get faster feedback because if

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,280
it's an automated process you can go

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,200
around that Loop and the developers can

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,920
find out that it it it it that it's

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,360
broken or it's not doing the right thing

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,000
much faster uh great example of that is

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,400
the Azure devops team at Microsoft went

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,760
from delivering who 12 features to

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,720
production per year for per 600 people

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
uh to delivering

76
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,840
280 features to

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,439
production per year per 600 people right

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,360
so the number of people didn't change

79
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,799
but massively increased the the the

80
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,959
number of features delivered but part of

81
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,799
doing that was changing the feedback

82
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,120
loop right making the feedback loop

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,239
faster they went from an automated build

84
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,200
that would take days to get a response

85
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,480
from to one that took minutes and

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
seconds to get a response from they were

87
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,879
able to they used to have to run their

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,120
full full Suite of tests in I think it

89
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,920
was four or five days to actually get a

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,319
response for a particular thing and now

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,640
it's 3 and a half minutes for the entire

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:15,799
test Suite that level of feedback makes

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,759
feedback faster costs less reduces risk

94
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,440
increases Effectiveness right that's

95
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,959
that that that shortened the feedback

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,240
loop if you're also deploying and

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,520
getting your feature in front of

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,360
customers that continuous delivery piece

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,160
so continuous delivery means you're

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,400
getting your product in front of real

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,479
customers your moving to production on a

102
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,800
continuous basis even the windows team

103
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,759
which is probably the biggest most

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,560
complicated product on the planet is 24

105
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,360
hours they're 24 hours or less doing

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280
continuous delivery from developer

107
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,800
cutting code to being in the hands of

108
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,919
real production users albe it inside of

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Microsoft it's 24 hours it's a week

110
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,840
they've got it in front of real external

111
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,720
users it's a month they've got it in

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,160
front of 20 million external users and

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,600
then it's three months they've got it in

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,360
front of I don't know 850 million

115
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,160
external users if crowd strike was doing

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,280
what the windows team does they would

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,800
not have caused the errors that they did

118
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,600
continuous delivery the practices within

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,479
the context of devops that enable

120
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,080
continuous delivery are the things that

121
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,680
reduce risk increase Effectiveness and

122
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
give you faster feedback
