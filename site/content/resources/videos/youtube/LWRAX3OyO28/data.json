    "description": "The True Power of Continuous Delivery: Reducing Risk and Increasing Effectiveness | Martin Hinshelwood\n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I explore the real value of continuous delivery, and it’s not just about being faster. While speed is a byproduct, the true benefits lie in consistency, reliability, and risk reduction through automation. I’ll share examples, including lessons from Knight Capital Group and CrowdStrike, to illustrate why continuous delivery is essential for modern software development.\n\n📌 Chapters:\n\n1. 00:00 – Introduction: What is Continuous Delivery?\n2. 02:15 – The True Benefit: Reducing Risk and Increasing Reliability\n3. 05:00 – Lessons from Knight Capital and CrowdStrike\n4. 08:30 – Feedback Loops: How Continuous Delivery Improves Effectiveness\n5. 12:00 – Real-World Example: Azure DevOps Team’s Transformation\n6. 15:30 – Scaling Continuous Delivery: The Windows Team Example\n7. 18:00 – How DevOps Practices Enable Continuous Delivery\n\n🎯 Who This Video is For:\n\n• Engineering leaders looking to reduce risk in software delivery\n• Teams aiming to implement or improve continuous delivery practices\n• Organizations seeking faster, more reliable deployment processes\n• Agile and DevOps practitioners focused on improving feedback loops\n\n📖 What You’ll Learn:\n\n• Why consistency and reliability are the core benefits of continuous delivery\n• How automation in DevOps reduces the risk of human error\n• The importance of faster feedback loops in improving product quality\n• Real-world examples of how continuous delivery transforms delivery capabilities\n• How practices like continuous testing and deployment ensure business protection\n\n💡 Key Takeaways:\n\n• Continuous delivery isn’t just about speed, it’s about reducing risk and increasing consistency.\n• Automation is key to protecting your business, brand, employees, and customers.\n• Shorter feedback loops lead to faster problem detection and resolution.\n• Examples like Azure DevOps and Windows teams show the scalability of continuous delivery.\n\nAt NKD Agility, we help organizations unlock the full potential of continuous delivery and DevOps practices.
