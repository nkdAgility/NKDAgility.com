If you're venturing into the realm of [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}), you might be pondering the benefits it brings to your organisation. While many tout speed as the primary advantage, I’ve come to realise that this is merely a by-product of a much deeper transformation. The true power of continuous delivery lies in the automation it necessitates within the [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) framework. 

### The Real Value of Automation

When we talk about automation in the context of continuous delivery, we’re not just referring to the tools that facilitate deployment. We’re talking about a fundamental shift in how we approach software delivery. Here’s what I’ve learned from my experiences:

- **Consistency and Reliability**: By automating deployments, we eliminate the variability introduced by human intervention. This consistency is crucial; it reduces the risk of errors that can lead to catastrophic failures.
  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Consider the infamous case of Knight Capital Group. Their manual deployment process led to a catastrophic failure, resulting in losses that forced them into bankruptcy. They went from having $450 million in the bank to filing for bankruptcy due to a single deployment gone wrong. This stark example underscores the importance of automation in safeguarding your organisation.

### Protecting What Matters

In my journey, I’ve seen how automation can protect not just the business, but also its brand, employees, and customers. Here’s how:

- **Automated Checks**: Implementing automated checks ensures that the software meets the minimum standards required by the business. This proactive approach significantly lowers the risk of deploying faulty software.

- **Continuous Everything**: Embracing continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery allows for rapid feedback loops. This means that if something goes awry, developers can identify and rectify issues much faster.

### The [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) Transformation

A prime example of the power of continuous delivery is the transformation witnessed by the Azure DevOps team at Microsoft. They managed to increase their feature delivery from 12 to an astonishing 280 features per year, all while maintaining the same team size. How did they achieve this? 

- **Shortened Feedback Loops**: They transformed their feedback loop from days to mere minutes. Previously, their automated build process took days to yield results; now, it takes just three and a half minutes to run the entire test suite. This rapid feedback not only reduces costs but also enhances effectiveness.

### Real-World Impact

The implications of continuous delivery extend beyond internal processes. For instance, the [Windows]({{< ref "/tags/windows" >}}) team at Microsoft exemplifies the power of rapid deployment. They can move code from development to production in less than 24 hours. This agility allows them to get features in front of users quickly, iterating based on real-world feedback.

If organisations like CrowdStrike had adopted similar practices, they could have avoided the errors that plagued their deployments. Continuous delivery, when executed effectively, reduces risk, enhances effectiveness, and accelerates feedback.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the journey towards continuous delivery is not merely about speeding up deployments; it’s about embedding automation into the very fabric of your development process. By doing so, you not only protect your business but also empower your teams to deliver high-quality software consistently. Embrace the power of continuous delivery, and you’ll find that the benefits extend far beyond mere speed.
