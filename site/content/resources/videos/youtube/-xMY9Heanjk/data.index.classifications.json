Although the explicit term 'customer focus' is not frequently mentioned, the conceptual alignment, depth, and practical guidance—especially around empirical process control and integrating customer feedback into product development—strongly fit the category. The audience is largely agile practitioners and coaches, and most of the discussion is highly relevant with minimal off-topic content. No penalties were required, as the content is current, supportive, and well-aligned with the specified meaning.",

    "reasoning": "The content doesn't explicitly mention 'first principles' nor provide canonical definitions, so Direct Mentions is low (1.3). It strongly emphasizes foundational elements of Scrum, particularly empiricism, aligning it moderately with First Principal, but it never clearly distinguishes these as non-negotiable, immutable truths, hence Alignment and Depth are mid-high (6.8, 6.3). The purpose is to promote foundational thinking but focuses more on coaching perspective than formal first principles exposition, so Intent is slightly above average (6.0). The target audience of Scrum practitioners aligns with the category (7.2). The core of the content is on empiricism and foundational flaws, so Signal is decent (6.9). No penalties apply. Overall, while the content broadly explores core ideas and the need to move beyond process mechanics to core agile philosophy (i.e., empiricism as a foundation), it never overtly situates these as immutable first principles or references recognized theorists' articulation of them.",

Explicit mention or detailed exploration of Product Developer responsibilities, cross-functionality, or collective accountability is missing.
