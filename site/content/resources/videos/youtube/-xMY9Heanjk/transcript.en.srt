1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,099
imagine was what is the hardest part of

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,080
working with a brand new scrum team I

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,180
guess it depends on whether you're

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,240
talking about a team member joining the

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,680
team or like a scrum Master right your

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,420
coach working with a brand new scrum

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,220
team it's probably both pretty similar

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,160
it's

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,840
it's what we think we know

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,000
I think it's it's the same is true when

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,579
you work with any group of people new

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,059
that you you it's

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,840
um I always this is one of my my tests

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,100
right I I ask teams people companies I

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,800
asked them

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,719
um how they think they're doing it's

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,820
grammar agile or whatever

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,899
and if they say we're awesome at it I

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
know it's going to be a complete car

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,280
crash

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,920
um and if they say well you know we're

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
we're we don't think we're doing that

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,420
well we really need some extra help uh

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,460
we're trying to do different things but

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,600
we're hitting stumbling blocks you know

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,420
it's going to be absolutely awesome

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,220
right because they've got they've got to

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,360
that point where they realize what they

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,880
don't know

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,000
and that's that's in a big inflection

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,320
point for for teams

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,780
um

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,460
so when you're working with teams new

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,220
teams

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,960
um the the the the biggest Gap is what

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,939
they think they know

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,159
they they think that they have to do

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,560
user stories they think that they should

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,579
be doing planning poker and story points

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,380
um they think they should be doing

41
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,240
estimation

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,740
um they think they should be doing burn

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,780
Downs they think they should be

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,579
monitoring their velocity and all of

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,380
those things are nothing to do with

46
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,540
scrum right they're they're barely

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,759
mentioned in the scrum Guide Burn Downs

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,520
are mentioned I'm not sure velocity is

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,220
but burn Down's mentioned as a EG here's

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,259
a list of things you might do

51
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,880
um so they're not intrinsic to the to

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,520
the process at all they're strategic

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,320
choices you might make right

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,960
um and trying to help them understand

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,200
the difference

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,860
between that and like the the the the

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,560
the fluff right so

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,200
the core the core thing that that we

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,400
need to understand as as individuals as

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,220
teams as uh members of teams

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,500
is that

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,720
we're trying to create we're trying to

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,720
leverage empiricism right

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,220
it's a scientific method we're gonna

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,739
we're gonna we're gonna do something

66
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,500
very small we're gonna get it to the

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,720
people who are gonna use it and then

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,099
we're gonna analyze their usage and

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,300
maybe get maybe they're gonna tell us

70
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,980
feedback we're going to analyze their

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,200
usage and then we're going to change

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,440
what we do based on that that Loop

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,940
that's that an empirical empirical Loop

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,879
and

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,800
that knowledge that understanding seems

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,540
to be fundamentally missing from from

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,099
from most teams that are doing scrum

78
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
right

79
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,879
um they they they they don't they they

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,879
never learned or never understood the

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,640
the foundational elements and they're

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,680
just looking at

83
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,860
the mechanisms

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,540
in scrum and just following mechanical

85
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,480
mechanical scrum

86
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,000
um so trying to get them to understand

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,019
that all of the mechanical parts are

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,459
just

89
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,099
so

90
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,980
the bollocks you need to make sure you

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,920
get the the the the the empiricism

92
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,620
feedback loops shortening the time to

93
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,900
Market getting that getting closing that

94
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,299
feedback loop closing that time to learn

95
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,659
right those are the things that actually

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,840
matter and whether you're doing

97
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:52,260
focusing on on kanban or scrum or kind

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,480
of an Ann scrum or lean or whatever it's

99
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,159
our devops it's all fundamentally the

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,299
same thing that we're trying to trying

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,159
to trying to achieve those underlying

102
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,620
foundations if we understand them

103
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,840
everything else is just right what would

104
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,959
we like to do in the way we do it in

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,879
order to be successful and

106
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,439
bringing those foundations in when

107
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,879
people have already built houses on top

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,879
and is much harder
