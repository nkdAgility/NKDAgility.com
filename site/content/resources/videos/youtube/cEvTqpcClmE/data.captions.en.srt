1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
think legacy systems can't be automated

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,360
think again a lot of organizations

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,360
assume that because something's old it's

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,920
untouchable that automation is only for

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,199
modern cloud native systems and that's

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,199
just not true in fact the biggest

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,640
efficiency gains often come from

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,480
tackling the most outdated cumbersome

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,640
processes the real issue isn't whether

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,519
legacy systems can be automated it's

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
whether organizations have the will and

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,719
the knowhow to do it properly the

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
challenge isn't just the technology it's

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
the way people think about the work they

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
assume that because something's always

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,280
been done manually that it has to stay

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
that way but that's a mindset problem

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,960
not a technical one devops and

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,840
automation tools aren't just about speed

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,680
they're about creating consistency

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
eliminating bottlenecks and freeing up

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,399
teams to focus on work that actually

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120
delivers value if you're still relying

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
on manual approvals handoffs or batch

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
processes just because that's how it's

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,080
always been done you're probably leaving

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,400
a lot of potential on the table the good

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,119
news you don't have to rip everything

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,040
out and start over automation isn't an

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,119
all or nothing decision it's about

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
incremental improvements that reduce

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,000
friction improve flow and build

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
confidence in your ability to deliver so

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
if your legacy system is slowing you

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,320
down the problem isn't the system itself

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
it's how you're managing it and that can
