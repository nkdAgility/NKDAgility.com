Think legacy systems can't be automated? Think again. A lot of organizations assume that because something's old, it's untouchable; that automation is only for modern cloud-native systems. That's just not true. In fact, the biggest efficiency gains often come from tackling the most outdated, cumbersome processes. 

The real issue isn't whether legacy systems can be automated; it's whether organizations have the will and the know-how to do it properly. The challenge isn't just the technology; it's the way people think about the work. They assume that because something's always been done manually, it has to stay that way. But that's a mindset problem, not a technical one. 

DevOps and automation tools aren't just about speed; they're about creating consistency, eliminating bottlenecks, and freeing up teams to focus on work that actually delivers value. If you're still relying on manual approvals, handoffs, or batch processes just because that's how it's always been done, you're probably leaving a lot of potential on the table. 

The good news? You don't have to rip everything out and start over. Automation isn't an all-or-nothing decision; it's about incremental improvements that reduce friction, improve flow, and build confidence in your ability to deliver. So if your legacy system is slowing you down, the problem isn't the system itself; it's how you're managing it.
