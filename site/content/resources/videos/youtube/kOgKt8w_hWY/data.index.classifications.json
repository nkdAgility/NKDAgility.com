While it aligns partially with Strategy through themes of cultural change and the aim to create strategic advantage, it seldom directly addresses strategic planning or high-level decision-making. Mentions of 'strategy' are indirect, and the discussion orients around high-level operational change rather than organizational strategic frameworks.
