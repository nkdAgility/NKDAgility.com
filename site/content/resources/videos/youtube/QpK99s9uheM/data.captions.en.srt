00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,259
and add your project manager is in my

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,840
book tends to be a little bit of an

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,620
oxymoron right

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,220
um they don't really go together

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,580
um while we can sprinkle some agility

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,300
into project management

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,620
may make a good scrum Master quite often

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,219
all they make is an agile project
