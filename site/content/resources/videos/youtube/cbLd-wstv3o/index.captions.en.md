How do you know what additional potential value you could be achieving with your product but that you haven't yet? How do you find those gaps? Evidence-based management has a key value area called unrealised value, where you would be expected to come up with some metrics to help you understand that dynamic. Now, evidence-based management does have some example metrics in there. You might look at the experience or satisfaction gap in your product. You might look at market share. You might look at other metrics that you can come up with for your product, but you need to understand what value's left on your table. That's where your product backlog comes from.
