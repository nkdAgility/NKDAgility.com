There's some alignment in the sense that continuous improvement and stakeholder involvement could support broader collaborative efficacy, but nothing notes human-AI partnership, distributed cognition, or the emergence of new capabilities from human-AI collaboration. Audience and signal scores are higher as practitioners in Agile/Scrum/EBM overlap with target groups, and the content stays on topic, but overall there is no substantive discussion of Collective Intelligence per the specific definition.",
