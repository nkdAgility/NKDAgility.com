  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When developing a product, it‚Äôs natural to focus on delivering value as efficiently as possible. But have you ever wondered what additional value you could be achieving but haven‚Äôt yet? How do you uncover those hidden opportunities to take your product to the next level? That‚Äôs where Evidence-Based Management (EBM) comes into play.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In this post, we‚Äôll explore how EBM can help you find unrealized value in your product, using key metrics and practical approaches to help you improve and deliver even more value to your customers.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-unrealized-value\">What Is Unrealized Value?</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Before diving into how to find unrealized value, let‚Äôs clarify what it means. Unrealized value refers to the potential value your product could offer but hasn‚Äôt yet. It‚Äôs the gap between where your product is now and where it could be, based on customer needs, market trends, or business opportunities.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>EBM includes a Key Value Area called <strong>Unrealized Value</strong> that helps you identify and measure these gaps, enabling you to refine your product backlog and prioritize future development efforts.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-identifying-the-gaps-metrics-to-consider\">Identifying the Gaps: Metrics to Consider</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now that you understand the concept, how do you actually find those gaps? EBM provides a framework for measuring unrealized value using a range of metrics. Here are some common metrics to help you get started:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-experience-or-satisfaction-gap\">1. <strong>Experience or Satisfaction Gap</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üìä <strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> How satisfied are your customers with the product?

In one of the teams I worked with, we noticed that despite solid user numbers and positive feedback, there was still room for improvement in user satisfaction. We were missing opportunities to enhance the product‚Äôs value.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-1-applying-ebm-metrics\">Step 1: Applying EBM Metrics</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We started by using <strong>customer satisfaction surveys</strong> and <strong>user experience feedback</strong> to measure where we were falling short. By diving into the data, we found that while our product had all the core features users wanted, it lacked polish in areas like usability and convenience.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-2-addressing-the-gaps\">Step 2: Addressing the Gaps</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>With this insight, we prioritized <strong>improving the user interface</strong> and streamlining the most frequently used features. These tasks were added to our backlog and quickly moved to the top of our priority list.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-3-realizing-the-value\">Step 3: Realizing the Value</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Within a few sprints, we noticed a sharp improvement in our <strong>Net Promoter Score</strong> (NPS) and user feedback. Our customers reported a much better experience using the product, and our churn rate dropped by 15%. By focusing on the areas of unrealized value, we were able to turn a good product into a great one.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts-continuously-striving-for-more-value\">Final Thoughts: Continuously Striving for More Value</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Unrealized value is a reminder that there‚Äôs always room for improvement, no matter how successful your product may seem. By using EBM and focusing on key metrics like customer satisfaction, market share, and innovation, you can discover hidden opportunities to grow your product and delight your users even more.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>üìù <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Use metrics like <strong>customer satisfaction</strong> and <strong>market share</strong> to find unrealized value.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Add insights to your <strong>product backlog</strong> and prioritize improvements that deliver the most value.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Keep reviewing and improving your product based on ongoing feedback and data.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>üöÄ <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always engage your stakeholders and team members in this process.
