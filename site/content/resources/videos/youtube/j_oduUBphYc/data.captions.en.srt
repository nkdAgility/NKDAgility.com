1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,080
legacy systems are a security nightmare

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,599
You know it I know it Outdated security

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,160
protocols compliance failures waiting to

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
happen systems nobody wants to touch

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,240
because well who knows what will happen

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,480
when they break The reality is these

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,720
systems were built in a different time

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,720
under different assumptions They were

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,519
never designed for the level of threat

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,720
we face today And yet businesses depend

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,680
on them Which means modernization isn't

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,120
optional It's inevitable But here's the

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,680
thing Modernizing blindly is just a risk

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
A bad move can introduce security holes

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,920
you never had before So how do you

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,480
modernize

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,559
safely at Naked Agility we don't just

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
talk about digital transformation We

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
help organizations understand their

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,000
systems of work so they can make better

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,520
decisions about security compliance and

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,760
maintainability This means looking at

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,119
how teams plan build and deploy software

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
It means integrating security first

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,119
practices not as an afterthought but as

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,439
a fundamental part of the way work

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,560
happens Because security isn't a

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,600
checkbox It's a continuous discipline

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,600
built into how teams collaborate how

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,720
decisions are made and how systems

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,720
evolve over time So if your legacy

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,520
systems are keeping you up at night

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
let's talk Because modernizing shouldn't

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
be about keeping up It should be about

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
getting ahead
