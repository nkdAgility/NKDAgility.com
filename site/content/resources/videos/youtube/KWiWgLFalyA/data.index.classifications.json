    "final_score": 30.0,
    "reasoning": "While the article addresses systemic issues and immutable constraints (such as the futility of scaling by headcount alone), it does not explicitly mention or differentiate 'first principles', nor does it delve deeply into foundational, self-evident truths underpinning Lean, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps. It advises on best practices like managing technical debt and feedback loops, but these are presented as key challenges and recommendations—not as non-negotiable, irreducible truths within modern product development. No direct reference to foundational theorists, explicit identification of first principles, or analysis of the consequences of violating such constraints means the alignment and depth scores are low. The target audience and subject are related, but content fit is ultimately indirect.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content discusses systemic challenges and best practices in scaling product development, but it does not directly identify or analyze first principles. It mostly offers practical advice, not foundational truths, so its alignment with the 'First Principal' category is weak.",
