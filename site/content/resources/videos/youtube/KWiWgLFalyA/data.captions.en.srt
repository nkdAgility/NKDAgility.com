1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,080
scaling product development sounds

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,919
simple right just hire more developers

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,040
write more code ship more features but

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,679
in reality it's never that simple

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,160
because scaling isn't just about growing

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,600
head count it's about building a system

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,800
that can grow effectively and that's

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,160
where things start to break down

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
communication starts to fray teams get

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,640
out of sync constraints emerge suddenly

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,559
instead of accelerating delivery slows

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,280
down and the more you scale the worse it

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,680
gets so why is it so hard it's because

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,360
most organizations focus on adding

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
people not fixing the system and when

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,360
the system is flawed throwing more

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
people at the problem just magnifies the

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,160
ineffectiveness take alignment for

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,600
example teams aren't clear on priorities

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,640
you don't get speed you get wasted

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,399
effort if technical debt isn't managed

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,160
every new feature gets harder to ship if

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,600
feedback loops are slow bad decisions

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:10,320
linger compounding the problem scaling

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,240
well means fixing these issues first it

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,600
means creating Clarity reducing friction

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,320
and enabling teams to move quickly

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,759
without tripping over each other and

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,920
that's where naked agility comes in we

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,680
help organizations build the kind of

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,400
systems that actually scale where teams

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,720
stay aligned delivery stay smooth and

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,840
adding more developers means faster

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,159
results not more

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,560
complexity if you're facing these

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,520
challenges let's have a conversation

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,040
because scaling doesn't have to be

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,040
painful you just need the right approach
