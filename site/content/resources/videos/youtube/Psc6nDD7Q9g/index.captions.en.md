Gaining an understanding of your existing process, the system within which you're working, is absolutely crucial in software engineering. We have really high variance between what we think is going to happen and what actually happens. 

Using Kanban, it allows you to observe your system, have metrics that help you understand your system, and visualisations that show your system. This enables you, as the team, as the people using the system, to understand the different things that are going on and look for patterns, places for improvement, and places that are awesome. 

It also enables you to maximise transparency of the work that you're doing and increase your ability to change, right? Because now you have agreed what all those things are and set up continuous deliveries.
