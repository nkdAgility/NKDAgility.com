1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,759
gaining an understanding of your

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,320
existing process the system within which

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,719
you're working is absolutely crucial in

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,280
software engineering where we have

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,279
really high variance between what we

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,400
think is going to happen and what

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,720
actually

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,199
happens using camman it allows you to

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,240
observe your system have metrics that

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,160
help you understand your system

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
visualizations that show your system and

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,640
allow you

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,559
as the team as the people using the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,079
system to understand the the the

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,200
different things that are going on and

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,000
look for patterns um places for

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,440
improvement places that are awesome and

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
enable you to maximize transparency of

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,840
the work that you're doing increase your

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,440
ability to change right because now you

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,840
have agreed what all those things are

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,840
and set up continuous deliveries
