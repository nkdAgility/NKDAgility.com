There are also peripheral references to Scrum and DevOps, but none connect to SLE. The audience (practicing or aspiring product owners, entrepreneurs in Agile/Scrum environments) could overlap with those benefiting from SLE knowledge, but this is a side effect rather than a purpose fit: the content is not serving as SLE guidance or analysis. The signal-to-noise ratio remains high since the content is focused, but the subject matter is entirely unrelated to SLE. No outdated practices or penalty triggers are present.
