1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,599
why do I think the advanced pspo is a

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:16,160
perfect fit for entrepreneurs because it

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,240
focuses on the things that that

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
entrepreneurs need to think about and

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,600
maybe sometimes they don't

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,359
um

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,699
are are what are you focused on what

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,240
what type of

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,160
um product owner right or are you

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,140
looking to be

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,360
um what are the the facets of the

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,180
product owner that you need to reflect

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,300
in order to have a successful product in

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,640
a successful business quite often people

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,579
believe that they just have to be the

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,800
Steve Jobs type right and focus on focus

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,940
on uh Innovation and doing something

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,300
different

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,860
but that that maybe doesn't is that

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,660
going to alienate your existing

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,340
customers that are just looking for

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,340
refinements and the features that they

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,640
already have is that going to alienate

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,799
your your development teams who feel

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,360
like we're always reaching for the new

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,659
thing and never finishing the thing that

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,240
we've got is that going to

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,880
um

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,540
you know if you just focus on one of

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,939
those uh facets of the the product or

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,320
stancies of the product owner then

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,600
you're missing out on a whole bunch of

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,700
other other things that need to need to

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,820
be done you need balance right and I

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,280
think that's really the core uh focus of

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,799
the the advanced product owner is not

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
just to say

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,439
you know yeah you might be in this

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,820
category where do you feel you are

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,460
because we do have that conversation

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,500
right where would you put yourself in in

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,640
these six stances of the product owner

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,000
that we're going to talk about in the

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,159
class but also and talk about each of

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,899
those stance season what they're missing

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,820
from those dances because quite often

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,200
product owners do a little bit of that

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,840
thing right the the the we talk a lot in

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,540
the class about hypothesis driven

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,000
engineering right you don't necessarily

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,640
although data informs but doesn't

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,739
control the choices you make you need to

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,200
get that data and how do you get that

54
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,480
data and how do you decide whether the

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,459
feature that you're creating is actually

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,959
valuable like what numbers are you

57
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,180
trying to shift and how are you going to

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,900
measure it so that that whole holistic

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,360
Focus across the product across your

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,660
your your your customers not just in

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Innovation but in customer focus in

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,459
collaboration in doing deals with people

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
right how do you get collaboratively

64
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,080
create those those most amazing products

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,959
and that for me is the value of the

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,879
advanced product owner

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,739
