1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
so number one tip for a new scrum master

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,540
I think is going to be read the scrum

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,300
guide you're a scrum Master you should

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,620
understand scrum I find that there's a

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,420
lot of scrum Masters out there who

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,160
haven't read the scrum guide that don't

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,699
understand scrum they don't understand

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,520
what they're expected to do and the

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,180
scope of it but the scrum guide is just

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,140
just the start you need to understand

11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:31,380
the first the principles behind uh scrum

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,120
of or empiricism and collaboration

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,480
um and and really get to grips with

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,480
those ideas
