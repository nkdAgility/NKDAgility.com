So number one tip for a new scrum master I think is going to be read the scrum guide. You're a scrum master, you should understand scrum. I find that there's a lot of scrum masters out there who haven't read the scrum guide, that don't understand scrum. They don't understand what they're expected to do and the scope of it. But the scrum guide is just the start. You need to understand the principles behind scrum, of empiricism and collaboration, and really get to grips with those ideas.
