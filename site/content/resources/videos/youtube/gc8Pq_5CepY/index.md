Hello everyone, and welcome back to my office hours! Today, I’m excited to dive into some of the questions that have come up over the past week. As always, I host this event every Wednesday at 6 p.m. UK time, where I gather interesting queries and do my best to provide insightful answers. So, let’s get started!

### The Importance of Interaction

Before we jump into the questions, I want to remind you that this is an interactive session. You can join me live on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn. However, I’ve found that YouTube offers the best experience with the least delay, so if you have questions, that’s the place to be! If you prefer to ask anonymously, feel free to use the link provided in the chat.

### What I’ve Been Up To

This week has been particularly busy for me. I conducted my fourth Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Foundations class online, engaging with around 20 participants across different time zones. It’s been a tiring but rewarding experience, and I’m thrilled with the discussions we had, especially around the roles, artefacts, and events in Scrum.

One of the key takeaways from our discussions was the idea that productivity often outweighs the sheer number of features delivered. As Satya Nadella has pointed out, focusing on the productivity of your team can lead to greater long-term success. For instance, the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) team has transitioned from delivering 25 features a year to nearly 300, all thanks to prioritising productivity over mere feature count.

### Addressing Common Questions

Now, let’s delve into the three main questions I want to address today:

1. **Conflating [Definition of Done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}}) with Acceptance Criteria**
2. **Spikes vs. Refinement**
3. **Handling Ad Hoc Work in Sprints**

#### 1. Definition of Done vs. Acceptance Criteria

A common misconception I encounter is the conflation of the Definition of Done (DoD) with acceptance criteria. While they are related, they serve different purposes:

- **Definition of Done**: This is a measure of quality that outlines what must be true for a product to be considered complete. It includes aspects like documentation, testing, and performance requirements. Essentially, it’s a checklist that ensures quality across all work items, regardless of their specific features.

- **Acceptance Criteria**: These are specific conditions that a [product backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) item must meet to be accepted by the [product owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) or stakeholders. They focus on the features and behaviours expected from the product.

To clarify, the DoD is about the minimum quality required for delivery, while acceptance criteria detail what needs to be achieved for a specific item. Both are essential, but they are not interchangeable.

#### 2. Spikes vs. Refinement

Another question that often arises is whether to use spikes or simply incorporate learning into refinement. Here’s my take:

- **Spikes**: These are time-boxed periods dedicated to research or exploration. While they can be useful, I believe they can create a false sense of productivity. Spikes often lead to story points being assigned to work that doesn’t directly deliver value to the customer.

- **Refinement**: This is an ongoing process where the development team reviews upcoming backlog items to gain a better understanding. It’s a more transparent way to handle uncertainty without inflating the backlog with spikes. I recommend using refinement as the primary method for addressing unknowns, as it keeps the focus on delivering customer value.

#### 3. Managing Ad Hoc Work in Sprints

Finally, let’s talk about ad hoc work. Many believe that Scrum cannot accommodate unexpected tasks during a sprint, but that’s not the case. Here’s how I approach it:

- **Capacity Planning**: It’s crucial to understand your team’s capacity for the sprint. This includes accounting for planned work, business as usual (BAU) tasks, and any unexpected issues that arise. 

- **[Transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}})**: Be open about how much time is reserved for ad hoc work. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your capacity for unexpected tasks, make sure the team is aware of this. 

- **Retrospective Discussions**: Use retrospectives to discuss how to reduce the impact of ad hoc work on your sprint goals. This could involve identifying areas for automation or improving processes to minimise disruptions.

### Conclusion

In summary, understanding the distinctions between the Definition of Done and acceptance criteria, the role of spikes versus refinement, and how to manage ad hoc work are all vital for a successful Scrum implementation. As always, I encourage you to ask questions and engage in discussions, whether here or in future sessions.

Thank you for joining me today! I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime.
