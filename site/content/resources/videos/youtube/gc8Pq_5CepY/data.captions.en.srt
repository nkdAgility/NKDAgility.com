1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,090
you

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:30,140
hello welcome to my office hours 23rd of

3
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,140
June

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:50,200
okay so I do this event every Wednesday

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,760
at 6 p.m.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:59,080
I collect as many interesting questions

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,970
as I hear during the week the week in

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,960
between so from Wednesday to Wednesday

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:09,460
and then I try and do my best to answer

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,340
those questions at this event as well as

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,380
answering it for folks directly as well

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,140
when they ask me and I have three

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:22,090
questions today that I'm going to go

14
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:26,410
over but I want to let you know that you

15
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:30,399
can ask me anything so you can either we

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:33,729
are at live on Facebook YouTube Twitter

17
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,050
and LinkedIn well I'm hoping we're live

18
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,940
on LinkedIn LinkedIn it's been a bit

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,130
funny I did a session earlier and it's

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,250
just a black screen so everything else

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,100
is working apart from LinkedIn so maybe

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,930
they're having a problem or maybe my

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,280
systems having a problem but we'll

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:54,750
figure it out ah the best place to

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,210
interact is on YouTube it has the best

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,390
experience and it's the least delay for

27
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:07,380
you watching if you have a question

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:11,489
please ask in the chat for this video

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,600
you can ask it on any platform I can see

30
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,090
theoretically the chat from all the

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,970
platforms I can't respond to LinkedIn

32
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:24,130
but I can obviously verily I just can't

33
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:27,420
reply we have again at YouTube is the

34
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:32,880
best place if you want to ask a question

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:35,860
anonymously you can use the link here

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,380
it's just our form of the text box and

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:44,169
you can ask anything you want about

38
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:47,169
DevOps scrum Kanban agile organizational

39
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,410
change metrics whatever you want and I

40
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,780
will

41
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,910
do my best to answer it I don't

42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,070
guarantee I'll have all the answers but

43
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,910
if I do not have an answer to a question

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:01,750
I will go off in between now and Nix

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,420
Wednesday find out an answer and try and

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,720
get you something for next week if I

47
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,260
don't have one yet so just a recap for

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:18,240
what I've been up to on Monday Tuesday I

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:20,830
did my fourth third no fourth fourth

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:25,870
professional scrum foundations class

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:29,190
live online for 20 odd people and I've

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:33,070
done two in Dublin timezone and two in

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,160
PST so at California timezone and this

54
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,490
was a California so I am tired I am

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,040
waning now it's 6 p.m. in the UK and

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,320
that was just when I was starting the

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,250
class Monday Tuesday so it's it's been

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,680
very tiring but we had a great time

59
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,520
during that class I'm just thinking I

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,990
might show you the mural that we created

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,330
as part of that class as long as I can

62
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,530
type and talk at the same time I didn't

63
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,980
have to type in my password that was

64
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,160
pretty good the part of the mural that I

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,510
thought might be interesting for you let

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:17,109
me put that up there and then I'll zoom

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:20,410
zoom out is we had our discussion

68
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:25,210
where's my magic button there it is well

69
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:29,740
let me let me disappear myself we had a

70
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,710
really interesting discussion for I was

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,990
probably about an hour and a half to

72
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,340
build this part of the mural but a

73
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,260
really interesting discussion on the

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:44,080
roles artifacts and events around scrum

75
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:50,680
and how they all go together and we

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,220
talked about the ideas that Satya

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,580
Nadella

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,380
has been talking about a lot recently

79
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:01,280
which is the M it's better to trade off

80
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,440
features for productivity

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
productivity of your team's productivity

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,250
of your people doing the work is

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,340
actually more important than actually

84
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,250
adding features because in the long run

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,380
you're gonna get way more features by

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,710
focusing on productivity let the

87
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,870
engineers figure that out a good example

88
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,480
of that is the azure DevOps team who

89
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,690
eight years ago were delivering 25

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:34,050
features to production each year and

91
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,870
today after a massive transition towards

92
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,360
agility there are delivering nearly 300

93
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,270
features to production each year if

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,240
you're a product owner that's worth the

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,440
massive multi-year investment in

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,350
productivity and setup and so building

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,110
this was a lot of fun especially with

98
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,860
the the group of folk that I had we had

99
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:02,040
three teams two teams of six and one

100
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,570
team of seven in our group well I think

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,360
that's how it broke down there was 20

102
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:11,880
people and Russell Miller and myself

103
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,330
were facilitating that so it was just a

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,300
lot of fun and we had only two not

105
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,350
scrums scrum master accountable for

106
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,450
progress and scrum master assigning work

107
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,510
or just assigning work to people in

108
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,670
general so we had a lot of fun Russell

109
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:34,680
and I and we got some really interesting

110
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,540
ideas out of this team so and as part of

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,510
not just that training but the other

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,220
questions that have come up folks that

113
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,940
have got in touch with me since last

114
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:50,700
week and I get three things that I kind

115
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:55,490
of want to talk about one is the idea

116
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,650
that a lot of folks have that conflicts

117
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:04,140
definition of done with acceptance

118
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:06,390
criteria and so I just want to define

119
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,800
both of those things to make it make it

120
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:14,380
more more transparent I want to talk

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,020
about spikes versus refinement

122
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,060
that seems to be a common question that

123
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,660
comes up that's always a good one and

124
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,070
then what do we do about ad hoc work in

125
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,350
the sprint that was one of the

126
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,840
conversations that came up during the

127
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,520
training on Monday and Tuesday and

128
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:37,120
there's maybe the belief that scrum

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,680
can't handle I'd hoc work however that

130
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:45,880
is not the case so let let's I'll maybe

131
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,740
a leave this up I'll put myself back on

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,900
there we go

133
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,430
and I might I might use a little bit of

134
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,340
space there to to draw stuff if I feel

135
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,070
like it but I'll leave that up just now

136
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,720
so the first one is Inc definition of

137
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:09,760
done with acceptance criteria I see that

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,500
a lot not just from new people to

139
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,670
agility but also with people that have

140
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,800
long experience in agility a definition

141
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,210
of done an acceptance criteria are not

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,420
the same thing

143
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:27,240
they are only loosely related to each

144
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:31,780
other so our definition of done is our

145
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,460
measure of quality if you were to get

146
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:39,400
everybody in a in a room who's

147
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,440
responsible for shipping your product to

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,719
production or authorizing your product

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,730
to ship to production or signing off on

150
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,480
your your your product being shipped to

151
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:54,340
production if you had software engineers

152
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,060
you had testers you had analysts and you

153
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:02,320
had operations you had security legal

154
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:06,310
maybe and product management if you had

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,910
all of those folk in a room and you

156
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,290
asked them to make a list of all of the

157
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,450
things that have to be true regardless

158
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,280
of what we're working on but regardless

159
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,440
of that so nothing to do with the

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,220
acceptance criteria or what it is we're

161
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,520
going to deliver what's a list of things

162
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,939
that have to be true in order for us to

163
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,970
ship to

164
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:33,609
reduction do we need documentation how

165
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,159
much what needs to be in it do we need

166
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:38,559
to do testing what type of testing how

167
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,799
much testing is okay for us to be happy

168
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,039
to ship to production make a list of all

169
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,689
of those things that have to be true

170
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,259
that's effectively your definition of

171
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:52,149
done do we need to support 10,000

172
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,189
simultaneous users if we need to support

173
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,929
10,000 simultaneous users then the

174
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,609
performance testing for 10,000

175
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,949
simultaneous users has to have passed

176
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:02,229
and there's all kinds of things like

177
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:05,049
that that can go in there and we might

178
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:07,689
want to think about code quality we

179
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:09,509
might want to think about refactoring we

180
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:14,229
might want to think about readability

181
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:17,169
unit tests code reviews these are all

182
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:19,509
things that go to the quality of our

183
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:23,799
product so we're not talking about scope

184
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:26,619
or features just the quality and that's

185
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:30,129
what the engineering team the the scrum

186
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:32,139
team the development team is accountable

187
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,470
for the development team is accountable

188
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:40,229
for quality not quantity of work okay

189
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:44,619
and whereas the acceptance criteria are

190
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:47,799
the if you think of a piece of work a

191
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:49,749
product backlog item which might be of

192
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,669
any type you like your product backlog

193
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,559
item you're going to have some

194
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:55,779
conversations with the product owner and

195
00:10:53,559 --> 00:11:02,169
with stakeholders and your acceptance

196
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:04,809
criteria are your measures by which the

197
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:10,779
folks that accept that your items have

198
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:13,869
been completed to the the level that

199
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:17,259
they desire and are met so I acceptance

200
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:20,319
criteria might be about features it's

201
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:23,139
going to be about behaviors you might

202
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:27,189
have a behavior based list of acceptance

203
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:31,869
criteria these are all customer centric

204
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:34,929
business centric ideas both the the

205
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:38,169
story the backlog item and the

206
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:41,109
acceptance criteria is around making

207
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:42,370
sure we understand what we're going to

208
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:45,740
go bill

209
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:49,730
definition of done is around the minimum

210
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,700
level of quality required for the how we

211
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,750
go build it I hope that kind of

212
00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:00,140
separates those two things a little bit

213
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:02,570
and makes it easier to define those two

214
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,110
we need a definition of done having

215
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,750
acceptance criteria is not good enough

216
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:13,030
to also be our definition of done at the

217
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,030
same time we need that extra piece ah

218
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,250
okay

219
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,800
so that was the first question about

220
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:25,240
conflating definition of done with

221
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,760
acceptance criteria it's pretty common

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,990
for for that to be something that

223
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,050
happens the second question was around

224
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,600
spike versus refinement should we have a

225
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,780
spike or should it just be part of

226
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,260
refinement I get that question a lot how

227
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,180
do we handle our something we don't

228
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,990
understand we have a piece of work that

229
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,240
we need to do we don't understand it yet

230
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,590
we've identified that we need to do some

231
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,360
learning or we need to do some

232
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:00,400
experimentation around that piece of

233
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,770
work how do we represent that work

234
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,350
there's one school of thought that we

235
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,750
should create a product backlog item

236
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,320
that would be cut we would call a spike

237
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:17,720
which is a time boxed amount of learning

238
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:21,890
that goes into our sprint and we it has

239
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:26,230
story points and we get credit for for

240
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,500
doing that work and I disagree with

241
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,440
spikes

242
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,780
I don't believe spikes are necessary and

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,660
I believe that spikes reduce

244
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:41,150
transparency for the amount of work we

245
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,830
can get done it makes it seem like we

246
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,480
can deliver more work than we can

247
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,000
because we did a bunch of story points

248
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,480
that were just investigation work rather

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,370
than actual work that we didn't deliver

250
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,730
any value directly to the customer you

251
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,790
using a spiked spikes our informational

252
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,830
output rather than value output or

253
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,930
learnings output rather than value

254
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,240
output which I'm not saying that

255
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,180
learnings aren't valuable they are and

256
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,160
but they're not what the customer is

257
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,740
paying for the customer is paying for

258
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:20,500
value all the stakeholders are paying

259
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:25,750
for value so in scrum there already is a

260
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:29,860
mechanism for a time for the development

261
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,410
team to look at things on your product

262
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:37,870
backlog that are coming up in future

263
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:41,470
sprints and gain more understanding of

264
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:44,170
what those items are we call that

265
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,290
refinement it doesn't have a specific

266
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,930
event or time box the scrum guide

267
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:54,070
defines it as maybe you shouldn't spend

268
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:58,930
more than 10% of your time in refinement

269
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:00,580
but the reality is if you're and if you

270
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,410
really understand the stuff on your

271
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,220
product backlog you probably spend less

272
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,990
than 10% of your time in refinement but

273
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,170
if you find something on your product

274
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,820
backlog that's super-complicated that we

275
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,339
really don't understand that we're going

276
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,740
to have to work together work with a

277
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,600
bunch of other folks you know get some

278
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,270
technology experts in do some

279
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,120
investigation talk to the customer

280
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,839
discuss trade offs maybe for some things

281
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,900
we spend more than 10% of our time

282
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,500
during the sprint in refinement we'd

283
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,600
like to keep it to the minimum we need

284
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:41,200
but maybe we need a little bit more than

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,020
we usually do and that refinement is

286
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,120
just work that we have to do for things

287
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,180
coming up it could be part of our UX

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,209
work it could be part of our analysis it

289
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,430
could be part of a skiing the customer

290
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,620
questions it could be implementation

291
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,080
things that we need we have to order

292
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,890
servers we have to whatever those things

293
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,170
are and that for me is just refinement I

294
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,380
don't want it represented on my backlog

295
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:12,100
because there's an amount of time

296
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,230
that we have in the sprint our capacity

297
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,360
for the sprint based on the people that

298
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,730
we've got and any vacations and things

299
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:25,090
they have and some time is just taken

300
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,840
away for other things and that's okay

301
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:31,000
that's kind of the reality of working in

302
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,790
an organization there's not just one

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,970
product there's many other product I as

304
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,140
a software engineer may have other

305
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,050
responsibilities than just showing

306
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,640
progress on a particular product and I

307
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,160
might have some support work I have to

308
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:49,560
do I might have some training that I

309
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:52,390
have to go do I might have some some

310
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,980
business as usual stuff I need to do

311
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,340
some checks in the morning when I come

312
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,280
in this is all time there is not product

313
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:04,120
work and if it's not product work I

314
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,120
prefer not to have it represented on the

315
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,620
product backlog because it's not to do

316
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,300
with the product it's not providing us

317
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,890
with value everything on the product

318
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,459
backlog should be things that are

319
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,050
valuable to our customer defined in a

320
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,640
way that they can understand our

321
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,160
customer our user our stakeholder

322
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,720
whatever you want to call it and I think

323
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:30,160
that idea kind of bleeds in to our ad

324
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:34,210
hoc work how do we deal with ad hoc work

325
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,390
in the sprint and so what I the way I

326
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:42,040
normally try and explain this is with a

327
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:43,840
little bit of our a diagram okay so

328
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,350
let's say we have we figured out what

329
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,490
our capacity for our sprint is and it's

330
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,750
about it's about this big okay I'll move

331
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,370
that a little bit to the left there we

332
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,540
go it's about this big this is our

333
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,060
capacity for the sprint and that

334
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,950
includes all the people whatever

335
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,190
whatever we're going to do that's just

336
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:07,240
the box that we can fill and we're going

337
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:10,660
to have some things that we know we're

338
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:15,960
going to have to do so for example and I

339
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:21,160
might take 10% of my time for refinement

340
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,330
okay I've got a little bit of work doing

341
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,490
refinement

342
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,250
and that's that's work that's already

343
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,289
allocated I'm gonna make sure that you

344
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,480
know I know only have 90 percent left to

345
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,600
go do that

346
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:39,309
and then I I find out that um we've got

347
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,929
some BAU business as usual there's some

348
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,640
checks that have to be run in the

349
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,620
morning there's some data that has to be

350
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,210
analyzed and has to be done every day or

351
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,210
every second day or every week or

352
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,149
whatever that is and we look at that

353
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:56,889
work across our whole team and it takes

354
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:58,360
about 20% of our time we just take a

355
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:04,080
look at that and that's that's what we

356
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:07,710
feel it takes so this is 20% for what b8

357
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,960
for BAU I'm just gonna call that BAU

358
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,620
business as usual so I'm gonna stick

359
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:19,029
that in there okay okay well we've get

360
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,399
70% of our time left but we need to hold

361
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:23,620
some of our capacity we you know we're

362
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:28,029
not our quality level is not where we

363
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:33,190
would like it to be and we need to spend

364
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:35,889
some amount of time working on things

365
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,220
that are wrong in production so either

366
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:41,799
productions down there's a bug there's a

367
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,070
customer support request whatever those

368
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,779
things are they're just things that are

369
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,809
are not working properly

370
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:55,090
oh my creator posted let's take that

371
00:19:49,809 --> 00:20:05,139
away so we're gonna spend 20% of our

372
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:06,490
time on support slash live issues you

373
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:08,289
can call that whatever you want but

374
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,730
that's effectively effectively what it

375
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:17,110
is support slash live issues okay so we

376
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:19,389
have 50% of our space left 50% has taken

377
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:25,120
by by other things that's that's that's

378
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:31,120
okay so let's say we have all of the

379
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,770
rest of that time is for our oh no no no

380
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,090
we've got we've got another thing we

381
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:39,350
need to look at let's say 10%

382
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,779
or at bunks you know those little things

383
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,610
that happen during the sprint or things

384
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,100
that get left over that we didn't really

385
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:51,419
spot that are too small to fit in a hole

386
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,640
sprint goal and but not big enough sorry

387
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:58,320
not big enough to justify our whole

388
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,580
sprint goal and but too small even if

389
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,590
you you know you don't want to have a

390
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,250
sprint that's a bug-fix sprint that's

391
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,900
gonna be a major problem so we're gonna

392
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,380
have that ten percent so now we have

393
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:14,820
forty percent of our time which is our

394
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:18,000
our work let's call it our goal our

395
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,059
sprint goal and we have forty percent of

396
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,740
our time to allocate to our sprint goal

397
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:29,490
is this okay does the scrum guide say

398
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,130
say this is okay it it does the scrum

399
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,529
guide doesn't say how much of your time

400
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:38,340
during the sprint has to be towards the

401
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:40,890
Sprint goal it just implies that as much

402
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,149
as possible this might be what's

403
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:48,360
possible we might only be able to spend

404
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:50,669
30% of our sprint focused on our sprint

405
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,350
goal so that's the focus for the team if

406
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:56,580
you think of the scrum values we want

407
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,710
focus and we've we've got some focus but

408
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,179
then we've got some leftover bugs I've

409
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,039
got those little little things that we

410
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,210
need to fix we'll get some support

411
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,309
incidents because some businesses

412
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:11,429
usually got some refinement okay however

413
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:15,659
everything I'm trying to think how I'm

414
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:25,760
going to represent this I'm just gonna

415
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:30,840
do align all of this piece here bugs ah

416
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:37,010
let's see bugs and live life site

417
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,010
incidents and be a you are and

418
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,390
opportunities for automation that's the

419
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,429
way I like to describe it okay

420
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,830
all except I can't spell opportunities

421
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:54,120
but you get the idea and we have

422
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:56,700
and okay I'm gonna get another word for

423
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:03,720
that let's see if it would let me do

424
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:08,130
that technical debt anything that's not

425
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,649
automated is technical debt so if it can

426
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,890
be automated and it's not automated then

427
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:15,990
its technical debt so maybe our quality

428
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,289
level isn't good enough that's why we're

429
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,029
getting 10% of our time spent on bugs

430
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:23,639
what can we do let's have a discussion

431
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,799
during our retrospective how can we make

432
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,450
that 10 percent smaller how can we

433
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,059
change our application change our

434
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,490
deployment change the way we do things

435
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,100
in order to have less bugs in production

436
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:40,380
that's that's one thing we can do why do

437
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:42,510
we have support LifeSite issues is there

438
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,639
something we've not automated in an

439
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,970
admin system that means we have to go do

440
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:49,919
it

441
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:53,010
is there some downtime a good example as

442
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,490
the azure devops team ran into an issue

443
00:23:53,010 --> 00:24:01,799
where for example if the profile service

444
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:04,470
for Azure DevOps failed then the entire

445
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:08,039
system stopped working does it make

446
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,100
sense for you as a software engineer not

447
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:13,710
to be able to commit code because it

448
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,169
can't go pull your profile picture and

449
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,690
your friendly display name it doesn't

450
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:20,760
make any sense it should be able to

451
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:24,179
continue without those things so they

452
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,120
had to go and add some work to their

453
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,070
backlog they had to do work to change

454
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,200
their architecture to support the

455
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,389
circuit breaker pattern and that circuit

456
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,669
breaker patent allowed them to remove

457
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,769
that support time remove that support

458
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:39,779
work and actually allowed them to get

459
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:42,000
rid of some of their bug time as well

460
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,639
maybe some of their BAU too because it's

461
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,230
all wrapped up in that things are going

462
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:48,360
wrong in production and we have to go

463
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,240
sort Atty we've got to go monitor these

464
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,669
things because we're having this problem

465
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,690
so there's some time that we can save

466
00:24:53,669 --> 00:25:01,429
there the idea is how can we make the

467
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:03,270
goal bigger and these other things

468
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:06,179
smaller

469
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,530
okay that would be one of the things

470
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,559
that I want the team to bring up at the

471
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:16,590
retrospective so to answer the question

472
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:18,600
how do we deal with ad-hoc work um it

473
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,200
just takes time away from the goal we

474
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,690
reserve some time for our ad hoc work

475
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,690
we're open and transparent about how

476
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,320
much time we're reserving I might I

477
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:37,290
might like to see something like this

478
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:40,710
diagram for my team and I want to be

479
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,480
able to focus on bring it up the

480
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,110
retrospective and focus on what can we

481
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,130
do to reduce those things so that was

482
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:52,920
really the three questions that I had

483
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:55,380
today there was conflating definition of

484
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,059
done an acceptance criteria they are not

485
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,880
the same thing they are separate things

486
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:02,929
definition of done is about the minimum

487
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:07,050
level of quality for delivering how

488
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:12,330
acceptance criteria is about adding more

489
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:15,990
detail to the what I talked a little bit

490
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:19,470
about spikes versus refinement you can

491
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,050
have a spike on your product backlog but

492
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,870
I think the the a better way is really

493
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:27,059
to focus on refinement as the activity

494
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,160
for figuring some of that stuff out so

495
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,110
you get out of Ament and and then as

496
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,260
part of that story because refinement

497
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,330
just takes ten percent of your time up

498
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,309
to ten percent of your time or not not

499
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,200
on average more than ten percent of your

500
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,800
time and I also talked a little bit of a

501
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:48,030
ad hoc work and how that fit into our

502
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,710
goal for scrum there sees other things

503
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,870
that we have to work on and how do we

504
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:55,280
balance that as a team as long as we're

505
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:59,580
open and transparent that's what counts

506
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,640
okay so I'm going to leave it there like

507
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,370
I said I was up very late I was teaching

508
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,870
till 1:00 a.m. last night in PST time

509
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:12,240
zone from GMT so I am tired and I've

510
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,059
answered all of the questions that we

511
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,040
have I would definitely ask if you've

512
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,960
got any questions that you

513
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,040
don't want anybody to know that you're

514
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,880
asking uh you could use this link here

515
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,130
to ask that question anonymously if you

516
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,380
are if you don't mind you can just ask

517
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,590
in any of the chats and I will hopefully

518
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:38,430
get to it and please let me know if the

519
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:42,920
LinkedIn video worked I don't know why

520
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:49,380
there's a problem there but for now I

521
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:55,280
will see you next Wednesday

522
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,280
unless I see you before okay thank you
