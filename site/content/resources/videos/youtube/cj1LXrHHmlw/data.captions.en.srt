00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
the hottest stack won't help if it's

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,839
wrong for your team but that's easy to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,120
forget when every conference talk job

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,280
post and blog is pushing the same tools

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,759
you see teams bragging about bleeding

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,960
edge architectures and it's tempting to

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,480
follow suit just to stay relevant but

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,439
context matters more than cruel a stack

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,279
that looks amazing in a unicorn startup

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
might fall apart in your enterprise

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,000
environment what's fast for one team

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,880
might be a bottleneck for yours and

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,480
adopting tech your team isn't ready for

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,360
is a recipe for waste at Naked Agility

15

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640

delivery constraints and your business

goals and then help you shape a tech

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,000
strategy that fits that could mean

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,039
modernizing simplifying or doubling down

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,359
on what's already working because real

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,320
innovation isn't about being seen to

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,640
