short_title: Avoiding the Trap of the Cool Stack
description: Stop chasing hype. Discover why context-driven tech choices, not the latest stack, lead to real, sustainable value for your team and business.
tldr: Choosing technology based on trends rather than your team’s needs often leads to wasted effort and complexity. Focus on your business goals, team maturity, and constraints to shape a tech strategy that truly fits. Prioritise what delivers value for your context instead of chasing the latest tools.

Everywhere I look these days, conferences, job boards, blog posts, there’s a relentless drumbeat for the “hottest stack.” It’s as if the only way to be relevant is to chase whatever shiny new tool or architecture is trending this week. I see teams boasting about their bleeding-edge setups, and I get it. The temptation to follow suit is strong. No one wants to be left behind, or worse, seen as old-fashioned.

But here’s the hard truth: the hottest stack won’t help if it’s wrong for your team. I’ve seen it time and again, organisations lured by the promise of speed, scalability, or “future-proofing,” only to find themselves tangled in complexity, bottlenecks, and wasted effort. Context matters more than cool. What works for a unicorn startup with a greenfield product and a team of polyglot engineers can fall flat in a large enterprise with legacy systems, regulatory constraints, and a different pace of change.

Let’s be honest: adopting technology your team isn’t ready for is a recipe for waste. I’ve watched teams struggle to deliver, not because they lack talent, but because they’re wrestling with tools they don’t understand, or architectures that don’t fit their reality. It’s like giving a Formula 1 car to someone who’s only ever driven a bicycle, impressive in theory, but disastrous in practice.

So, what’s the alternative? How do we break out of this cycle of trend-chasing and move towards something that actually delivers value?

Here’s what I recommend, and what I help CTOs and tech leaders do every day:

- **Start with your context**: What are your business goals? What constraints do you face, regulatory, operational, or otherwise? What’s the maturity of your team? These are the questions that matter.
- **Assess your current state**: Sometimes, the best move is to modernise. Other times, it’s about simplifying, or even doubling down on what’s already working. There’s no shame in sticking with a proven stack if it serves your needs.
- **Shape a tech strategy that fits**: This isn’t about being seen to move fast. It’s about making the right moves for your system, your people, and your outcomes. Real innovation is context-driven, not trend-driven.

I’ve helped organisations make these decisions, sometimes that means introducing new tools, but just as often it means resisting the urge to jump on the latest bandwagon. The goal isn’t to impress at the next conference; it’s to deliver value, sustainably and predictably.

If you’re a CTO or tech leader feeling the pressure to “keep up,” my advice is simple: pause, reflect, and focus on what’s right for your team and your business. The right stack is the one that helps you achieve your goals, not the one that gets the most likes on LinkedIn.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Don’t let hype dictate your technology choices.
- Context, team maturity, and business goals should drive your tech strategy.
- Real innovation is about fit, not flash.

If you’re ready to move beyond trend-chasing and build a technology strategy that actually works for you, let’s talk. Because in the end, it’s not about the stack, it’s about the outcomes.
