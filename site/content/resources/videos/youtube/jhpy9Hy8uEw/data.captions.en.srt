1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,460
question was why did I choose the

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,160
scrum.org track rather than the scrum

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,800
Alliance track and the initial the

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,539
initial Choice was kind of not a choice

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,720
at all

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,119
um I kind of fell into the scrum.org

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,920
track right around the time that that

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,920
Ken left

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,260
separated from scrum Alliance and

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,059
founded scrum.org

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,180
um a few months after that I

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,980
participated in training from Richard

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,020
hundhausen

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,879
um who created the professional scrum

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,320
developer which is now the applying

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,300
professional scrum with software

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,399
development

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,340
um I I participated in love beta for his

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,120
class in Australia so I flew down to

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,399
Australia to to do that I became uh uh

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
uh the idea was to become a professional

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,079
scrum trainer with scrum.org and it was

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,019
funded by my boss at the time Adam Cogan

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,000
uh so I can blame Adam for for for that

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,780
that choice there

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,100
um but I think the reason I've stayed

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,840
with scrum.org is because of a number a

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,720
business ethos like I don't like working

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,700
with organizations

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,040
that I feel and this this is very

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,299
personal I feel

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,299
um don't

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,220
um respect the topic respect the people

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,979
respect the customer

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,280
and I feel like scrum.org do a very good

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,640
job of that I feel like

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,140
um this this idea that you can you as

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,720
the customer right you're coming for

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,939
training that you can you magically

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,579
forget your your all your knowledge

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,320
every two years and the way you get that

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,439
knowledge back is to pay two hundred

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,460
dollars right that doesn't sit well with

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,960
me I prefer the scrum.org model where

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,299
um once you've got a certification

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,060
you've got it right like your driver's

47
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,179
license or uh your University degree

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,060
you've got it you've passed bar and then

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,160
if you want to dive more deeply and

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,459
increase your knowledge there are other

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,379
bars that you can also add to your story

52
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,780
but that's up to you right that's your

53
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,220
choice whereas that idea that your

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,459
knowledge is taken away and you have to

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,940
re-certify as that's how that one's crap

56
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,540
um and I feel like the investment the

57
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,580
the scrum.org has made in

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,780
the idea of community

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,000
that we are one group of of of trainers

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,760
that we collaborate that we have shared

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,780
courseware that we all contribute to so

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,459
if you take a class in in uh in Africa

63
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:57,239
or China or Australia or the UK or the

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,280
US you're going to get

65
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,920
class that consists of the same

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,580
fundamental ideas it's going to consist

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,560
of the same story right

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,140
um and that comes through the the the

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,940
consistent courseware uh the steward

70
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,800
system have a steward system for

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,840
managing that courseware

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,500
um and the the constant sharing that we

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,620
do as a as a community so for example a

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,180
lot of uh we use mural now in the

75
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,260
virtual space right

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,140
um and scrum.org provides standard

77
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,819
murals that are as generic as possible

78
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,739
like they don't tell the trainer how to

79
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,840
teach their class they don't tell the

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,580
trainer what to say but here's a flow

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,819
with the exercises and the knowledge

82
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,640
that we want to want to share in it

83
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,200
um and then I have my own version of the

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,019
murals that I share back to the

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,560
community and my murals are more

86
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,299
specific right I include liberating

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,260
structures trading from some of the

88
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,000
training from the back of the room

89
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,760
content

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,940
um I I have created my own ways of

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,440
telling stories of doing exercises and I

92
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,840
create those murals and then I share

93
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,900
them back to the PST community so other

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,340
psts can leverage them so that

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,340
the greater the community as a whole

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,000
um the the the the the more powerful it

97
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,460
is in in telling its story right if all

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,740
the Traders are better then the whole

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,240
story is better and I think that's

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,820
really important so it's that sense of

101
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,840
community that I like and I've been a

102
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,840
PST for let's have a look 13 years 13

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,160
years now I was back in early in 2010

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,160
