# Choosing Scrum.org Over Scrum Alliance!

Discover the compelling reasons behind choosing Scrum.org over Scrum Alliance for scrum training. Dive into this insiderâ€™s journey, uncover hidden truths, and find out why Scrum.org is favoured by professionals seeking effective and lasting certification. Get ready to transform your understanding of Scrum training options with eye-opening insights!

#Scrum  has two major certification bodies that are responsible for creating #scrumtraining and certification programs. Scrum.Org and #scrumalliance.

The majority of people who become a #scrummaster, #productowner, or #agileleader pass through one of these two certification paths, and go on to build a career in #agile based on what they have learned in the training room.

So, what is the difference between these two bodies? Why would you choose one over the other when presented with a choice?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why he chose the scrum.org path as both a student and a #professionalscrumtrainer.
