Question was why did I choose the scrum.org track rather than the scrum Alliance track and the initial the initial choice was kind of not a choice at all.

Um I kind of fell into the scrum.org track right around the time that that Ken left separated from scrum Alliance and founded scrum.org. A few months after that I participated in training from Richard Hundhausen, who created the professional scrum developer which is now the applying professional scrum with software development.

Um I participated in love beta for his class in Australia so I flew down to Australia to do that. I became uh uh the idea was to become a professional scrum trainer with scrum.org and it was funded by my boss at the time Adam Cogan. Uh so I can blame Adam for that choice there.

Um but I think the reason I've stayed with scrum.org is because of a number a business ethos like I don't like working with organizations that I feel and this this is very personal I feel um don't um respect the topic respect the people respect the customer. 

And I feel like scrum.org do a very good job of that. I feel like um this this idea that you can you as the customer right you're coming for training that you can you magically forget your your all your knowledge every two years and the way you get that knowledge back is to pay two hundred dollars right that doesn't sit well with me. 

I prefer the scrum.org model where um once you've got a certification you've got it right like your driver's license or uh your University degree you've got it you've passed bar and then if you want to dive more deeply and increase your knowledge there are other bars that you can also add to your story but that's up to you right that's your choice whereas that idea that your knowledge is taken away and you have to re-certify as that's how that one's crap.

Um and I feel like the investment the scrum.org has made in the idea of community that we are one group of trainers that we collaborate that we have shared courseware that we all contribute to so if you take a class in in uh in Africa or China or Australia or the UK or the US you're going to get a class that consists of the same fundamental ideas it's going to consist of the same story right.

Um and that comes through the the the consistent courseware uh the steward system have a steward system for managing that courseware um and the the constant sharing that we do as a community. So for example a lot of uh we use mural now in the virtual space right.

Um and scrum.org provides standard murals that are as generic as possible like they don't tell the trainer how to teach their class they don't tell the trainer what to say but here's a flow with the exercises and the knowledge that we want to want to share in it.

Um and then I have my own version of the murals that I share back to the community and my murals are more specific right I include liberating structures trading from some of the training from the back of the room content.

Um I have created my own ways of telling stories of doing exercises and I create those murals and then I share them back to the PST community so other PSTs can leverage them so that the greater the community as a whole um the the the the more powerful it is in in telling its story right if all the traders are better then the whole story is better and I think that's really important.

So it's that sense of community that I like and I've been a PST for let's have a look 13 years 13 years now I was back in early in 2010 that I started this journey.
