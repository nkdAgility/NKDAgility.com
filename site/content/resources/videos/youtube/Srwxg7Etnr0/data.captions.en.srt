1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,500
so the question is how does a scrum team

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,080
decide on a Sprint goal

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,500
if you were to look in the Sprint guide

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,480
it says it just happens but we all know

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
that's not going to be true right it

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
doesn't just magically pop into people's

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,439
ideas

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,000
uh some people would attest

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
that

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,640
the developers and the product owner

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,079
work together during the Sprint to come

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,399
up with a Sprint goal and I would say

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,800
that's partially true I feel like if you

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,100
walk into your Sprint planning and you

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,680
don't already know or don't already have

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,960
an idea about what your Sprint goal is

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,059
going to be you're already at a

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,699
disadvantage I would normally discuss

19
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:59,340
what a probable Sprint goal for the next

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,460
Sprint would be at my Sprint review with

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
my stakeholders I'd probably be talking

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,180
about

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,220
um what it is we should be working on

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,979
next what does that look like how does

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,420
that fit into the strategy so when I do

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,560
walk into

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Sprint planning and we already have an

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
idea which direction we're going and

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,100
then perhaps we're writing we're writing

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,140
the Sprint goal right we have an idea

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,820
about what it should be and now we've

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,560
got to get it down on paper we've got to

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,560
quantify it and then we've got to select

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,659
the items that go towards it I can

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,820
definitely see circumstances where you

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,400
walk into Sprint planning and you don't

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,840
know up front what it's going to be

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,659
perhaps stakeholders just dropped a

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
bombshell on you at the Sprint review

40
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,860
perhaps the market just dropped a

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,740
bombshell on you at the Sprint review or

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,960
after perhaps you just don't know yet

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,420
right it's just too up in the air and

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,740
you you you you didn't know enough and

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,119
it's going to be a really long Sprint

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,439
planning because we've got to figure it

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,140
out

48
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,380
um but how does the team decide on a

49
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Sprint goal they collaborate between the

50
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,119
product owner and the developers with

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,340
significant input from the stakeholders

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,780
from with significant input from the

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,780
market in the business contact next
