    "reasoning": "The content exclusively discusses Scrum team practices for defining a Sprint goal, focusing on collaboration, stakeholder input, planning, and agility. There are no direct or indirect mentions of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent synergy, or engineering practices relating to agentic software delivery. The audience is Scrum practitioners, not explicitly those adopting or exploring agentic approaches. At best, some minor alignment exists conceptually (e.g., mention of feedback loops or collaboration), but these are generic agile themes, not agentic. The content does not touch on the core constructs or technical specifics that define Agentic Software Delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content strictly addresses collaborative Sprint goal-setting in Scrum, with no referencesâ€”direct or indirectâ€”to agentic software delivery, AI agents, or supporting practices. Minimal or no fit for the assigned category.",
