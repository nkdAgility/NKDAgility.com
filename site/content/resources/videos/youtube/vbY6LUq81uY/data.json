    "description": "Funding Products Like an Entrepreneur: Hypothesis-Driven Development | Martin Hinshelwood\n\nðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I explore how building products is akin to launching a startup. When your team is writing code, theyâ€™re doing something thatâ€™s never been done beforeâ€”and that requires a mindset shift. By thinking like entrepreneurs and funding products as venture capitalists would, you can maximize your return on investment while minimizing risks.\n\nðŸ“Œ Chapters:\n\n1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Building Products as a Venture Capitalist\n2. 02:30 â€“ The Risk Profile of Building Products\n3. 05:00 â€“ The Importance of Small Experiments and Proof of Concept\n4. 08:15 â€“ Real-World Example: The Birth of IMDb\n5. 12:00 â€“ Hypothesis-Driven Development vs. MVP Misuse\n6. 15:30 â€“ How to Evaluate Return on Investment for Products\n7. 18:00 â€“ Staying Within Budget with Continuous Experimentation\n\nðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:\n\nâ€¢ Product managers and project managers seeking better ways to fund product development\nâ€¢ Entrepreneurs and innovators looking for parallels between startups and internal product funding\nâ€¢ Agile teams embracing hypothesis-driven development and continuous experimentation\nâ€¢ Organizations wanting to maximize ROI on product and project investments\n\nðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:\n\nâ€¢ Why building software is inherently a high-risk, high-variance activity\nâ€¢ How to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset for product funding within your organization\nâ€¢ The importance of running small, hypothesis-driven experiments\nâ€¢ How to evaluate the potential ROI of your product or project investments\nâ€¢ Why products should be funded dynamically rather than upfront\n\nðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:\n\nâ€¢ Product development is like a startup: itâ€™s risky, uncertain, and full of potential.\nâ€¢ Lots of small experiments can help you discover what works while staying within budget.\nâ€¢ Hypothesis-driven development enables you to adapt and invest only in what delivers value.\nâ€¢ Think like a venture capitalist: focus on ROI, market fit, and continuous iteration.\n\nAt NKD Agility, we help organizations embrace hypothesis-driven development and entrepreneurial funding models to maximize their product success.
