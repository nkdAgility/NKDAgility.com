00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,120
Building

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,919
Products

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,559
is always doing something that's never

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,599
been done before any anytime you've got

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,080
a team writing code they're doing

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,080
something that's never done been done

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,480
before if they weren't doing something

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,039
that's never been done before you

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,439
wouldn't be writing code you would be

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,320
buying the product right you would be

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,000
buying the framework you'd be buying the

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:32,079
thing so anytime we're we're building

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,960
products we're doing unknown things

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,559
right that's why we have such a high

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,480
degree of variance in software

16
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:43,640
engineering and in the business space

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,879
there is something that kind of ah does

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,640
it kind of equates to that or an analogy

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,000
within the business context purely

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,399
within the business context and that's

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,079
entrepreneurialship right if you've got

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,039
an idea for a for a for a company that

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,640
delivers some kind of value regardless

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,040
of how that value is

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,720
achieved then you need to go and find

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,200
somebody to invest in that idea and that

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,600
works almost the same within the context

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,479
of a of of an organization than it does

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,240
in the context

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,000
of me if I wanted to go start a new

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,720
business I would need probably need to

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,759
go speak to the bank I might need to go

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,680
find some Venture capitalists I need to

34
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,960
convince them I to find people in my

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,759
company I need to convince them that

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
it's a good idea that needs to be

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,439
promoted up to a level of somebody with

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,200
some some some some spending power and

39
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,479
that person with some spending power

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,600
offers me the ability to to go try this

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,040
out and I but I have to convince them

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,880
right but new ideas things that have

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,000
never been done before are are not

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,040
guaranteed they're not guaranteed to

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,360
work they're not guaranteed to have the

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,399
return on investment that you expect

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,399
them to to and if you're in business you

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,119
already

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
understand this concept right I believe

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,200
I

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,160
believe my numbers might be slightly off

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,800
but I believe that 70% of new businesses

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,440
fail within the first year and 30% of

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,959
the leftovers fail within five years I

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,360
think I might I might be underestimating

56
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,440
the second part the fiveyear part it

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,360
might be more than that so the risk

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,599
there is a risk profile to everything

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,000
you do when you're investing money

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,959
in a possible outcome within your

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,159
business or external to your business so

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,120
you need to figure out what your risk

63
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,040
profile is for investment in things that

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,480
have never been done before and you need

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
to gauge the return that you're

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,519
expecting to get on the investment that

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,000
you're putting in and this is exactly

68
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,200
how products should be funded as well

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,599
and if we're going to fund a product in

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,879
that way and I'm going to be the one

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:08,280
funding that

72
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:13,920
product I want to see value and Market

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:17,879
fits as quickly as possible right so

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,680
what we tend to do is run lots of very

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,640
small

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,959
experiments so I might come to you and

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
say I need some money sorry I'm

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
switching personality here I'm going to

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,120
come to you say I I need I need some

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,680
money I want to try out this idea hi

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,480
I've got this idea for a a database of

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
movie stars right and you're like how

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,680
are you going to make me some money

84
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
because you you want to return on your

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,439
investment so I'm thinking well I I

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,200
really I'm the geek right I want to have

87
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,760
uh a database of all the movies with all

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,040
of the actors and then then you can ask

89
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,280
well can we have the budget for the

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,000
movie in there can we have how much each

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,239
of the actors made can we have and

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,040
suddenly you've good an idea of who you

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,200
could sell this product to right what

94
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,879
its possibilities are going forward into

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,760
the future with a little bit of ideation

96
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:16,199
from that geek idea of of having a movie

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,280
database and IMDb is born right which is

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,239
which is massive now if if you don't

99
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,759
know IMDb has two halves it has the

100
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,880
public free half uh which is where we

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,400
just go look up movies uh but then it

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,680
sells inside of the industry um and can

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,960
give directors for example who are

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,280
looking for a a a leading man or a

105
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,320
leading lady um it can give them data on

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,199
who can make my movie the most money oh

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
it's the rock well well I can't afford

108
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,840
the rock who's within my price range for

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,360
the budget for my movie that I can get

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,600
that's going to maximize the amount of

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,080
money and they pay LinkedIn a sorry they

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,479
pay IMDb a lot of money for for for that

113
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,880
story that that's not something that was

114
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,639
within anybody's anybody's budget it was

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,520
a venture capitalist effort right so you

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,000
want to be thinking within the context

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,479
of your business you want to be thinking

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,120
more like entrepreneurs thinking more

119
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,440
like Venture capitalists what's your

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,520
return on investment if you put money

121
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,280
into this product or

122
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,680
project what do you get how much do you

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,520
get what's the longevity of what you get

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,000
what's what's the story for this I want

125
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,120
to see a business plan I want to see a a

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,120
lean even a lean canvas right on on what

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,479
does this look like have people thought

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,880
about the the different aspects of it

129
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,360
before I'm going to let them spend some

130
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,680
money and even once they're spending

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,520
money I I want to I want to see a little

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,680
thing I want to see a proof proof of

133
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,759
concept right let's get something out

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,280
there see what it looks like get it in

135
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,759
front of some other people let's let's

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,319
does it does it resonate with people

137
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,080
does it seem like it's going to provide

138
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,759
value okay what's the next stage what's

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,199
the next bigger thing we can do what's

140
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,720
the next experiment that we can run I

141
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,560
talk about it as hypothesis driven

142
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,240
engineering practices lots of folks out

143
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,440
there use the phrase

144
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,080
MVP they're mostly I see MVP minimum

145
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,919
viable product being kind of misused

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,319
minimum viable product is a proof of

147
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,120
concept that you throw away at the end

148
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,880
before you build the real

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,680
product I know lots of people use it as

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,319
a small experiment so whatever context

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,919
you use it within but we want to be

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,479
running lots and lots and lot of small

153
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,080
experiments we know lots of experiments

154
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,360
are going to fail but we're going to

155
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,919
find the ones that work and then we're

156
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,199
going to invest more in those invest

157
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,759
Less in the ones that don't work and

158
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,280
that's how you stay within budget lots

159
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,319
of little little experiments that have a

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
hypothesis right what are you what are

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,080
you going to

162
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,879
do what do you expect the world to be

163
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,120
like afterwards how are you going to

164
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,240
measure whether you've been successful

165
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,160
and we want to see the numbers and we're

166
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,120
we're going to Cull anything that is not

167
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,840
living up to its expectation unless we

168
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,919
can be convinced otherwise right there's

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,280
there's heart as well as as data and and

170
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,759
build your products and stay within

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,759
budget
