 Funding Products Like an Entrepreneur: Hypothesis-Driven Development | Martin Hinshelwood

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I explore how building products is akin to launching a startup. When your team is writing code, theyâ€™re doing something thatâ€™s never been done beforeâ€”and that requires a mindset shift. By thinking like entrepreneurs and funding products as venture capitalists would, you can maximize your return on investment while minimizing risks.

ðŸ“Œ Chapters:

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Building Products as a Venture Capitalist
2. 02:30 â€“ The Risk Profile of Building Products
3. 05:00 â€“ The Importance of Small Experiments and Proof of Concept
4. 08:15 â€“ Real-World Example: The Birth of IMDb
5. 12:00 â€“ Hypothesis-Driven Development vs. MVP Misuse
6. 15:30 â€“ How to Evaluate Return on Investment for Products
7. 18:00 â€“ Staying Within Budget with Continuous Experimentation

ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:

â€¢ Product managers and project managers seeking better ways to fund product development
â€¢ Entrepreneurs and innovators looking for parallels between startups and internal product funding
â€¢ Agile teams embracing hypothesis-driven development and continuous experimentation
â€¢ Organizations wanting to maximize ROI on product and project investments

ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:

â€¢ Why building software is inherently a high-risk, high-variance activity
â€¢ How to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset for product funding within your organization
â€¢ The importance of running small, hypothesis-driven experiments
â€¢ How to evaluate the potential ROI of your product or project investments
â€¢ Why products should be funded dynamically rather than upfront

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

â€¢ Product development is like a startup: itâ€™s risky, uncertain, and full of potential.
â€¢ Lots of small experiments can help you discover what works while staying within budget.
â€¢ Hypothesis-driven development enables you to adapt and invest only in what delivers value.
â€¢ Think like a venture capitalist: focus on ROI, market fit, and continuous iteration.
