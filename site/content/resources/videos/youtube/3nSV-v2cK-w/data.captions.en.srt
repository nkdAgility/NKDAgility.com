1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,200
so the first major benefit is that depth

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,179
of learning that you'll get because

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,219
you've got more application

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,780
what do I mean by this

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,240
there's a weird thing that happened

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,980
during the covered lockdowns when kids

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,140
were homeschooling

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,220
suddenly

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,260
instead of being at school learning

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,119
maths with a teacher who knew the maths

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,220
the kids were at home learning maths

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,260
with their parents doing maths that they

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,880
hadn't done for 30 years

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,100
so the first thing the kids have to do

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,260
is teach their parents how to do that

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,719
kind of maths

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,879
guess what the kids learned their maths

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,620
better because they weren't just trying

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,960
to learn it they were learning it in it

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,120
to enable them to teach people about it

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,340
and then this concept of learning

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,020
together which really helps so you end

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,300
up with a much deeper level of learning

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,399
when you're applying the skills as you

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,320
learn the skills when you can see that

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,780
Journey coming together so there's that

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,059
real depth of learning that you really

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,440
get and you can get no other way than in

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,440
application of things

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,920
the second thing is

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,640
practical

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,280
experimental learning that complement

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
what they're doing in their real life so

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,780
while it's great to go through exercises

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,420
in class and it's great to use metaphors

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,880
to create your stories it's great to use

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,320
pre-prepared exercises that allow you to

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,420
come out of your context to learn things

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,340
this allows you to do that and then take

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,720
them back directly into your real

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,180
context

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,939
So you you're actually seeing it work

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,560
where you are rather than just work in a

44
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,439
classroom setting

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,060
so this this makes it real it makes it

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,159
something tangible it makes it something

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,340
that helps them do their job better

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,420
while they're doing their job

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,640
the third one what is the cohort setting

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,399
by doing this as a group of people

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,380
either in the same company or it

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,899
actually ideally in this in different

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,000
organizations in a public class setting

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,800
you're bringing different Knowledge from

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,440
different experience from different

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,940
Industries and and different thoughts of

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,220
different organizations you're getting

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,180
to help each other and understand more

59
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,160
about

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,739
what's going on in the world you get

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,599
this idea of I am not alone it's not

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,580
just me with these struggles it's not

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,160
just me trying to fight against these

64
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,620
parts of the organization

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,280
because I think everyone forgets this

66
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,500
the when you go and do scrum

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,660
it's different to what traditionally

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,819
organizations have done and

69
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,400
organizations have spent years and

70
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,800
decades evolving to be fit for purpose

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
for how they already do things so when

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,239
you start doing scrum you'll find

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,120
yourself rubbing up against things like

74
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,180
um legal teams like um the way Human

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,319
Resources teams interact with people

76
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,780
you'll find all of these support

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,819
structures that are the you know pmo

78
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,319
offices is another classic one where

79
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,360
they're all set up to deal with how we

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,360
currently do things but now we're doing

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
things differently that's hard so when

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,900
it's not just you when you can see other

83
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,940
people and pitfalls that they're having

84
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,560
in their organization and you can talk

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,940
to them about ways of overcoming it and

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
the way they've overcome it in their

87
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,560
organization and bring that back that's

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,540
really really valuable and it's giving

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,440
you a really wide community of practice

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,120
with a really wide set of experiences

91
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,099
but it's really hard to set up a

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,980
community of practice because any good

93
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,959
team has to go through some stuff to get

94
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,540
to be a good team you know you can be

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
all right when things are nice but if

96
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,319
you look at even any sports team they

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
only get to be great if you've gone

98
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,120
through some stuff together to allow you

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,220
to merge so this is giving you the group

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,959
of people and it's giving you the stuff

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,599
you've got to go through together

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,000
and talk and make yourself vulnerable

103
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,819
but at the same time get that safe space

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,220
where you can get good help

105
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,260
why should that stop with a class

106
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,480
I'd be very disappointed if it did I'll

107
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,920
be honest so I think the cohort element

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
would be the third great benefit
