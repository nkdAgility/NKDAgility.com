1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,259
so organizational agility provides a

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,299
competitive Advantage for organizations

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,279
not because agile's the point because

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,260
it's not right lots of organization

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,060
that's why a lot of our agile

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,240
Transformations agile Transformations

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,500
fail is because the the the agile

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,420
becomes the point not a tool to get to

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,579
the outcome that the business really

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,920
needs which is being able to respond to

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,480
the market faster that that's ultimately

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,340
what it is

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,940
um that we're trying to do with with

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,000
agile with devops with lean with kanban

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,700
with all of these practices are designed

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,160
to enable your organization to respond

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,480
more quickly to Market changes if you

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
can respond more quickly than your

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,079
competitors to Market changes you get

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,520
there first and quite often the person

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,739
who gets there first is the one that

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,460
gets the prize right

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,280
um it it it it's really hard for a lot

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,040
of organizations to be able to

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,100
um respond to the same right so I I

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,140
think something in the market changes it

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,340
could be a customer complaining it could

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,740
be

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,840
um like a fundamental shift in the

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,820
actual Market

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,000
um and and your business needs to

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,280
respond how long does it take to respond

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,159
because the signal happens we need to

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,900
make a change and does it have to go up

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,659
your organization through different

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,040
layers to the person at the top and then

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,439
the person at the top makes a decision

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,119
and then those decisions go back down

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
and it sounds like well that could be

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
quite quick we've got a quite a flat

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
organization but the problem is that

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
because the person who's dealing

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,060
directly with the market doesn't

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,460
actually

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,560
care quite often they don't they don't

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,100
care that much right they want to do the

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,600
right thing but not it's a job right

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,399
um they're they're they're looking at

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,259
that change and going well that's not

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,520
painful enough for me to escalate it to

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,100
Bob because it's a pain in the ass

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,659
talking to Bob so I'm just gonna shut up

53
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,819
for a while and then a couple of months

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,160
later well this is now getting painful

55
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,900
enough I'm gonna escalate it to Bob so

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,360
it goes goes and talks to Bob and then

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,520
it has to be painful enough for Bob for

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,080
him to escalate it to the next level and

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,340
then painful enough to escalate it to

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,400
the next level

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,739
so it can be a really long time before

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,599
it escalates up the chain and then how

63
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,000
often have you heard leadership in your

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
organization say you know we're changing

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
strategic Direction and we're going this

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,920
way

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,840
and nothing happens right and it's

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,459
because that that communication has to

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,319
come all the way back down the

70
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,480
organization so a lot of agile and a lot

71
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,040
of agile practices is about

72
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,080
um pushing responsibility down the

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,239
organization enabling the people who

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,239
have the most information about what it

75
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,459
is we need to do to actually respond

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,260
themselves to the market right they

77
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,819
don't have to go ask anybody let's just

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,860
deal with these things that are

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,300
happening so your business responds more

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,620
quickly but that means you have to

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,280
provide those people with a lot more

82
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,760
context a lot more understanding uh if

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,319
you go look up turn this ship Around by

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
David Marquette

85
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,420
um that's a a perfect story talking

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,519
about that how do you know when you can

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,200
do something if it's within your power

88
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,659
to do it well you need more contextual

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,040
information about the right decision to

90
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,920
make

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,620
um and that's really what agile is all

92
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,560
about it's about enabling us to go uh

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,840
faster and in the in the in the market

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,300
right deliver things more quickly

95
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,459
respond to that change more quickly and

96
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,140
surprises there's good changes and bad

97
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,580
changes right but respond to the market

98
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,500
more quickly
