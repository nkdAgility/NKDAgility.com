1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,120
while while we don't use Lego in our

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,240
training classes we have been known to

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
use

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,480
mine and you might say well why is

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Minecraft okay but Lego isn't and it's

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,800
about the complexity and collaboration

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,400
of the experience we don't we don't use

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,759
Lego throughout the whole class um we

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,720
don't use Minecraft throughout the whole

10
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,719
class

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,360
we use it for a very specific

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,879
circumstance which is demonstrating to

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,640
people how they feel in the office when

14
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,640
the level of complexity is too high
