While we don't use Lego in our training classes, we have been known to use Minecraft. You might say, "Well, why is Minecraft okay but Lego isn't?" It's about the complexity and collaboration of the experience. We don't use Lego throughout the whole class. We don't use Minecraft throughout the whole class either. We use it for a very specific circumstance, which is demonstrating to people how they feel in the office when the level of complexity is too high.
