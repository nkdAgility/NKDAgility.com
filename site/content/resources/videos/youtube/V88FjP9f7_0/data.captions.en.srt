1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,399
phrase less is more does apply in the

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,200
agile space it really does and can ban

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:13,360
as well

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,160
so doing less to do more is really

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,560
important one of the the the the Core

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,119
Concepts of the agile Manifesto is

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,240
maximizing the amount of work not done

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:30,679
so let don't do stuff that's not of any

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:34,800
value but if you can focus in on the

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:38,200
work that's of value and do more that

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,200
would be even better
