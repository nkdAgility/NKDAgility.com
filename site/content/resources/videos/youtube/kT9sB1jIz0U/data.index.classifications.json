However, it does not explicitly reference ethos, foundational beliefs, or system-level evidence as defined in the category. Discussion is more principle-driven than system-driven, with some allusions to underlying values through behaviors, but ethos is inferred rather than deeply dissected. There is limited exploration of ethos in the context of Agile, DevOps, Lean, or systems thinking; most examples are personal or general to modern workplaces, not directly to delivery systems. Nevertheless, themes like respect, authentic capability, and sustainable collaboration resonate with ethos grounding. Audience and purpose are moderately relevant, aimed at workplace and team improvement rather than technical or transformational leadership, but the signal-to-noise ratio is strong, and some alignment with ethos exists.",
