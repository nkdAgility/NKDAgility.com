1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,580
I love hierarchies of competence because

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,580
they're based on they're based on

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,500
respect right they're not based on

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,320
control they're not based on telling

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,839
people what to do they're based on

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,180
recognized

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,000
competence and capability of the people

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,800
that are doing the work and

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,539
you you you you we naturally defer

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,359
um sometimes to those people or want

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,680
more information from those those folks

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,660
to help convince us to do things because

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,239
they've demonstrated that knowledge that

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,280
they are an expert in that space that

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,420
they can add value to the conversation

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,700
and that perhaps they have a more

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,180
um

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,100
holistic view of all of the facets of

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,020
the problem and are able better able to

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,020
to make that decision
