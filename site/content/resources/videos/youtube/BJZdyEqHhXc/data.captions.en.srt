1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,000
so there's no way

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:10,759
for an external

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,719
party to come in and give you a solution

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,200
recipe something that that you can no

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,880
recipe is the wrong word but there's no

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,240
way that somebody can come into your

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,720
organization and just tell you how to do

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,720
your stuff it's the reason that the the

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,760
big

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,960
Consulting companies don't affect any

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,399
change is the reason that the the big

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
Frameworks for agile or devops don't

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,840
actually tend to change anything in the

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
organization um apart from cost durin

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,120
your bank account that's big Consulting

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:47,199
companies too um it's the

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,199
reason that most

18
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,199
organizations struggle to incorporate

19
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,920
the story that they're trying to they're

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,920
trying to work towards a new story right

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,920
and the reason that they struggle is

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,439
because they're trying to buy it

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,720
in rather than adapt it it's like if you

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,720
wanted to be a

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,960
gymnast

26
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,200
and are you just going

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,600
to hire

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,600
somebody to do the gymnastics for

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,200
you but you wanted to be the gymnast

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,200
they're the gymnast you're not the

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,799
gymnast

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,360
so there's a fallacy

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,880
in

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,640
Consulting that a lot of Consulting is

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,520
just Contracting right you're hiring

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,200
somebody in to do the job you've got a

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,119
butt on a seat doing that job for you

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,640
and if that job inside of your

39
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,799
organization is a business critical job

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,600
which anything that's around the the the

41
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,159
the purpose of your organization

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,159
anything that's around how your business

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,079
does business is critical to your

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,240
organization then you're Outsourcing

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
part of your organization and now why

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,280
would anybody in your organization learn

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
how to do that thing because there's

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,280
somebody else doing it who doesn't want

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
to share it cuz they're a

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,959
contractor and if they keep that

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,599
knowledge they keep their job if they

52
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,040
share that knowledge they lose their job

53
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,080
and that for me is the big difference

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,560
between Contracting and Consulting right

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,040
although a lot of people sell Consulting

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,280
when actually they're doing contract

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,760
acting and that's that um the purpose of

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,480
a

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,319
consultant is to provoke

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,159
change that's probably the most

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,319
interesting way to say it is the the

62
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,360
purpose of a of a consultant is to

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,959
provoke change the consultant shouldn't

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,959
be doing any of the work within your

65
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,440
organization if you hire a consultant

66
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,040
you're not hiring them as an agile coach

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,640
that's a contractor you're not hiring

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,959
them as a development lead or a project

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,159
manager that's not a consultant that's a

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,080
contractor right there's somebody in

71
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,920
your organization doing the work what a

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,840
consultant is an

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:27,239
advisor who provokes change they are

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,519
somebody from the outside who maybe has

75
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,239
additional deep Knowledge and Skills in

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,360
that particular topic who doesn't come

77
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,840
in to just tell you how to solve the

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,400
problem even if they know how to solve

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,480
the problem right they might give you

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,799
advice but they're not going to solve

81
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,000
the problem for you but they help enable

82
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
you as the person inside the

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,720
organization or group of people if it's

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,480
a team to

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,640
understand the

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,360
theory so that you can make the

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,879
decisions for the organization so that

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,040
you can make the changes in the

89
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,000
organization and because you understand

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,720
the theory and the

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,480
principles you're able to then make the

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,879
future decisions as well that are better

93
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,840
than the previous decisions if that

94
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:24,320
makes sense the whole idea of

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Consulting is to help organizations

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,440
change by provoking the people inside of

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
the organization to do things

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
differently AB
