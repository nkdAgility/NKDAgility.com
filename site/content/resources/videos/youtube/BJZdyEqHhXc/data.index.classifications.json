    "reasoning": "The content focuses on debunking myths about 'quick fixes' in Agile and DevOps, emphasizing internal capability building and empowerment over outsourcing. While it covers empowerment, team learning, and sustainable improvement, it never mentions or substantially discusses AI agents, agentic architecture, or agentic delivery frameworks. There are no explicit or even implicit references to the deliberate integration of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-AI synergy, nor the specific engineering/governance practices central to agentic software delivery. The intended audience overlaps (practitioners/teams), and the high signal-to-noise ratio reflects the focus on practical guidance for sustained improvement, but the topic does not conceptually align with the core definition of Agentic Software Delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article focuses on team empowerment in Agile/DevOps and internal capability, with no reference to agentic software delivery or AI agent integration. It does not fit the category beyond a generic relevance to software delivery teams.",
