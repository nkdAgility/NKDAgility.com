1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,280
we need to change the way we focus and

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,880
what we focus on within the context of

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,920
these organizational strategies business

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,240
strategies technical strategies that we

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,880
need um to be able to adapt to complex

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,199
work right did you see how much I try to

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,320
avoid the word agile there don't think

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,880
about it as agile think about it as

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,960
increasing our capability maximizing our

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
value and maximizing our Effectiveness

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,600
to to to deliver that the name the

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,239
moniker is irrelevant cuz what we've

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,399
ended up with by a focus on the

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:44,239
mechanical elements is We've Ended up

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,920
with back backlog Barons and scrum

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,039
stumblers um that's product owners and

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,480
scrum Masters that have no uh capability

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,600
uh to do what they're being asked to do

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,239
and they're pushed into positions of uh

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,039
uh just not knowing not knowing what

21
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,839
they're doing so what what we you can

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,560
what I've got a couple of previous

23
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,479
videos on this topic on the detail of

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,640
what went

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,960
wrong but a summary is that demand has

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,720
outstripped supply of competent people

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,119
and businesses have reduced the bar in

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,240
order to meet the the the open positions

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,520
so we got a bunch of people who don't

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,240
know what they're doing um there's not

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,320
been a focus on continuous learning and

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,960
hiring people for that mentality

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,680
especially for the specific positions

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,000
like product owner um and and scrum

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,680
master um and engineers and Lead

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,399
Engineers to be able to to have the body

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
of people within our organization the

38
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,960
the the the the culture and Outlook

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,399
within our organization that that moves

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,640
Us in that in that direction so that's

41
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,600
where we are now and we need to look at

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,320
where we're going to go next and how

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,520
we're going to get there the first thing

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,520
we need to do is fix the hiring

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,120
practices we need to stop hiring people

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,959
who have no competence for the thing um

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
that we're trying to do it's absolutely

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,680
okay to bring

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,720
in interns and bring in people at at the

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
lower levels but we want to be bringing

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:30,959
people in at the lower levels in the

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:33,560
work context right so think of it as

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,440
um I'm trying to think how to describe

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,400
this uh the way the way I think if we

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,519
want good leaders in our organization

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,920
who are able to lead products or lead

57
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,000
people right I'm I'm thinking of them as

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,720
two separate things because product

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,680
management is leading the product um and

60
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,239
I don't know what the name of the other

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,600
one is leadership is leading Leading the

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,760
People um then

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,519
[Music]

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,840
we need people who understand the

65
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,879
context that we're working in to be

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,480
those to be those people leaders so

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
where where do they come from well

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,959
usually they've done the job right they

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,080
they they've done something within the

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,959
context I I work with some great scrum

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,599
Masters um I by the way this is why I'm

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,760
saying this I I'm not talking about

73
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,840
being a software engineer I'm not

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,560
talking about writing code I'm not

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,439
expecting a scrum Master to be able to

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,920
write

77
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:40,959
codes right I know scrum Masters

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,280
well I might roll that back a smidge but

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,760
um I know I know scrum Masters who have

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,720
never been coders who have perhaps been

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,159
a business analyst or perhaps been a

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,920
tester right or perhaps been some other

83
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,640
context within within a team and they've

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,280
demonstrated they've worked hard

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,599
they've brought in and learned the

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,799
philosophies around enabling a team to

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,720
be effective they've made suggestions

88
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,720
that panned out within the context of

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,599
their team their team has noticed that

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,199
they quite often make suggestions that

91
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,160
pan out and help them and the team has

92
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,440
promoted them to scrum

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,680
Master that's the way I think about how

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
you become a scrum Master right is you

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,919
don't get hired into that position the

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,440
team hires you into that the the team uh

97
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,840
enables you to pick up that

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,240
accountability however you want to

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,080
describe it the team get together and go

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,720
uh yeah Bob is really good at this stuff

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,560
Bob can you help coach us to do more

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
stuff to do more capability they've

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
already gained the respect of the team

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
by participating in the team

105
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,039
participating in the work that the team

106
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,800
is doing so the team knows they

107
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,280
understand the work and they're making

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,639
suggestions on how we do our boards or

109
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,080
different practices or different

110
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,919
engineering things we can bring in to

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,880
understand that so uh does somebody

112
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,240
who's a scrum Master need to be able to

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,479
code I would say no more than anyone

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,720
needs to be able to code which is yes um

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,720
I don't know if you've looked at the

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
international computer driver's license

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,080
but um at most of the levels the

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,039
coding's pretty basic uh being able to

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,120
understand those logical constructs

120
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,960
because then you can participate in

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,160
conversations you can participate in

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,440
understandings like what architectures

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
what patterns and practices are valuable

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,080
within the context of a particular

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,080
product if a product's big focus is

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,639
engineering a scrum Master needs to

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,280
understand the patterns and practices of

128
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,360
engineering if the focus of the the the

129
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,880
people the doers is

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
on

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
accounting right then the scrum Master

132
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,840
needs to understand the patterns and

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
practices of

134
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,080
accounting so that they can help coach

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,960
that group of people towards better

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
accounting better organization of that

137
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,240
work better planning better all of the

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,479
just making things more effective right

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,120
so

140
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:26,360
um that's where we need to get to so

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,720
we've got we've got a where we are right

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,720
with which is lots of incompetent people

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,240
doing the roles and we've got a where we

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,160
want to get to which is lots of

145
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,240
competent people doing the roles it's

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
for me it's fairly logical how we make

147
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,840
that transition is we stop hiring people

148
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,840
that can't do it and start hiring people

149
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,039
that do um primarily try and promote

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,840
from within our organization into those

151
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:54,039
roles um and and improve the overall

152
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,319
capability and lead by example so this

153
00:06:54,039 --> 00:07:00,960
is this is why we want scrum Masters who

154
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,360
are supposed to be lead ERS right so a

155
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,599
scrum Master might be a delivery manager

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
they might be a defined role in your

157
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,240
organization they might be a delivery

158
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,919
manager they might be a lead developer

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,520
who has uh that picks up the

160
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,720
accountability of scrum Master they

161
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,960
could be something else right um but

162
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,639
they're they're they pick up that

163
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,759
accountability and they are somebody who

164
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
has those lifelong learning genes I

165
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
don't know how better to describe it has

166
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,560
that lifelong learning mindset that

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,000
lifelong learning philosophy um that I

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,840
want to understand the world better and

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,240
they demonstrate that through leadership

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,840
so they lead the team and that they are

171
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,840
demonstrating that this is how we want

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,159
people in our organization to behave

173
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,240
right every time an organization

174
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,080
promotes somebody who's not capable it

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,039
tells every other capable person in the

176
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,919
organization that this organization is

177
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,840
not for

178
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,280
that that's what's been happening

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,280
promoting people through lack of

180
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,680
competence um and just not having the

181
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,080
right people in the right place uh

182
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,080
there's a great book

183
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,319
uh

184
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,080
uh the

185
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:32,240
right ideal team player it's a great

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,760
book and it's the ideal team player and

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,959
