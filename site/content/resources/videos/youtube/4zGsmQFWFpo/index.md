# Where are we now and where do we need to go next

üõ†Ô∏è It‚Äôs Time to Refocus: Building Competence and Value in Our Organizations üíº

In this video, I talk about the need to shift our focus within organizations to maximize capability, value, and effectiveness‚Äîwithout getting caught up in labels like "Agile." We‚Äôve ended up with too many underqualified Scrum Masters and Product Owners in roles they can‚Äôt handle, which has resulted in backlog barons and scrum stumbles. I explore the root of this problem‚Äîhiring people without the competence to deliver‚Äîand the importance of promoting from within, focusing on continuous learning, and building leadership that inspires teams. If we want to grow, we need to fix our hiring practices and cultivate leaders who understand the context of the work. Watch to learn how we can all move forward together by hiring the right people, promoting competency, and fostering a culture of lifelong learning. üå±
