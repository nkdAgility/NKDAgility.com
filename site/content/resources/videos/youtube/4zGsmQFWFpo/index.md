In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving landscape, focusing solely on _Agile_ as a label can be limiting. Instead, the goal should be to increase our organization‚Äôs **capability**, **maximize value**, and **enhance effectiveness**. It's not about the moniker; it‚Äôs about achieving outcomes that matter. üèÜ

## **Why Agile Isn't the Focus**

In many organizations, the term _Agile_ has become synonymous with processes and frameworks, leading to what I call "backlog barons" and "scrum stumblers." Here‚Äôs what I mean:

- **Backlog Barons**: Product owners who focus too heavily on managing backlogs without a deep understanding of the product.

- **Scrum Stumblers**: Scrum Masters who lack the skills to guide and coach teams effectively.

This problem stems from a **misalignment** between the skills needed and the people hired for these roles. We need to shift our focus from simply filling positions to **building capabilities**.

* * *

## **The Problem with Incompetent Scrum Masters and Product Owners**

### **How Demand Has Outstripped Supply**

The demand for Scrum Masters and Product Owners has grown exponentially, but the supply of **competent professionals** has lagged behind. As a result, organizations have lowered the bar to fill open positions. This has led to:

- **A shortage of expertise** in critical roles.

- **A lack of focus on continuous learning** within these positions.

- **Hiring practices** that prioritize quantity over quality.

### **Where We Are Now**

Right now, many organizations are struggling with teams led by people who are not equipped to fulfill their roles effectively. This is not necessarily the fault of the individuals‚Äîit‚Äôs a systemic issue that needs addressing at the **organizational level**.

* * *

## **Fixing Hiring Practices to Build Competence**

To move forward, we need to rethink how we **hire and develop talent**. Here‚Äôs what we should focus on:

### **1\. Hire for Potential, Train for Competence**

- It‚Äôs okay to bring in **interns or junior hires** as long as they are integrated into a work context where they can learn and grow.

- Focus on **promoting from within** to build leaders who already understand the organization‚Äôs unique context and challenges.

### **2\. Look for Lifelong Learners**

- **Scrum Masters** and **Product Owners** should possess a **lifelong learning mindset**.

- Prioritize candidates who demonstrate a willingness to **continuously improve** and **adapt** to new situations.

### **3\. Promote Contextual Leadership**

Think of leadership as two distinct roles:

1. **Leading the Product**: This is about guiding product development to deliver maximum value.

3. **Leading the People**: This involves coaching and mentoring teams to be more effective.

**Personal Insight: Why Context Matters in Leadership**

I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working with some great Scrum Masters‚Äîindividuals who may not have come from a software engineering background but excel in **enabling their teams to succeed**. For example, I‚Äôve seen former **business analysts** or **testers** rise to the role of Scrum Master because they understand the team‚Äôs challenges and can offer actionable solutions.

* * *

## **How Scrum Masters Should Emerge from Within the Team**

### **The Organic Path to Becoming a Scrum Master**

A Scrum Master shouldn't just be hired into the role‚Äîthey should _emerge_ from the team. Here‚Äôs why:

- They already have **team respect** through their contributions.

- They have a deep understanding of the **work context** and what makes their team tick.

- They are naturally inclined to coach and **support the team‚Äôs growth**.

Imagine this scenario: a team member named Bob has consistently made suggestions that improve the team‚Äôs workflow. Over time, the team starts looking to Bob for guidance, eventually encouraging him to take on the Scrum Master role. This kind of organic transition leads to **greater respect** and **better results**.

* * *

## **Should Scrum Masters Know How to Code?**

This is a question I get often, and my answer is nuanced:

- **No, Scrum Masters don‚Äôt need to be coders**, but they should understand the **basic principles** that guide their teams.

- It‚Äôs important for Scrum Masters to understand the **patterns and practices** of the domain they‚Äôre working in, whether that‚Äôs software engineering, accounting, or another field.

### **Tailoring Competence to the Work Context**

- If a product team is focused on **engineering**, a Scrum Master should have a grasp of **technical practices** to help guide discussions.

- If the team is focused on **finance**, the Scrum Master should understand the **nuances of accounting** to coach the team effectively.

This understanding helps Scrum Masters **participate in conversations** and contribute meaningfully to the team‚Äôs progress.

* * *

## **Moving Forward: Hiring Competent People & Promoting from Within**

### **1\. The Path to Competence**

The journey from where we are‚Äîfilled with roles occupied by those who aren‚Äôt fully equipped‚Äîto where we want to be is clear:

- **Stop hiring people** who lack the necessary skills.

- **Start promoting** individuals from within who have demonstrated the ability to grow.

- **Lead by example**, showing what competence looks like in practice.

### **2\. The Role of Scrum Masters as Leaders & Lifelong Learners**

Scrum Masters should not only facilitate team activities but also embody a **commitment to lifelong learning**. Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

- **Embracing new challenges** with curiosity and determination.

- **Demonstrating leadership** by guiding the team through continuous improvement.

- **Setting the tone** for the organization, showing that learning and growth are valued.

When an organization promotes a capable person, it sends a **positive message** to others. Conversely, promoting someone who lacks competence can discourage those who are truly capable from stepping up. üìâ

* * *

## **The Impact of Promoting Incompetence: Why It Hurts Organizations**

One of my favorite books, _The Ideal Team Player_, delves into the **qualities and behaviors** that organizations should look for when hiring and promoting. When we **lower the bar** for filling roles, we risk:

- **Diminishing morale** among talented team members.

- **Undermining the organization's values** and commitment to excellence.

- **Missing out on innovation** that comes from hiring and promoting the right people.

* * *

## **Building a Culture of Capability and Value Delivery**

**Key Takeaways for Organizations**

To create a **thriving, capable organization**, focus on the following:

- **Hire for competence**, not just to fill roles.

- **Invest in continuous learning** for Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and team members.

- **Promote from within** to build leaders who understand the context of your work.

- **Encourage a culture** where learning is valued and mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth. üå±

**Final Thoughts**

By shifting the focus beyond just "Agile" and prioritizing **capability, learning, and leadership**, organizations can **unlock new levels of effectiveness**. It‚Äôs time to move away from the mechanical and embrace a mindset that truly drives **value delivery** for our customers.

Ready to build a team that thrives? Start with **competence**, **context**, and a **commitment to continuous improvement**. üöÄ

* * *

By focusing on the _how_ rather than just the _what_, we can create an environment where **Scrum Masters lead with insight**, **teams collaborate effectively**, and **businesses deliver true value**. That‚Äôs what agility is really about‚Äîbeing ready for anything, with the right people at the helm. üåü
