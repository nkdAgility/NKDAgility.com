00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,580
according to the chaos report from the

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,639
Standish group small projects of under

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,800
50 participants are 30 percent more

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,620
likely to be successful with agile

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,220
practices and large projects of more

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,840
than 50 people are over 200 percent more

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,060
likely to be successful

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,699
hopefully this short video will help you

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,800
identify the key differences that make

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,439
this possible

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
my name's Martin henshawott I'm a

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,759
professional scrum trainer with

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,739
scrum.org professional kanban trainer

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,520
with Pro kanban and I've been a

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,260
Microsoft MVP in devops for 14 years

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,000
so we have the traditional model the

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,460
empirical model and we're going to look

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,379
at that within the context of visibility

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,879
right how much visibility do our

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,860
stakeholders have we're going to talk

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,300
about change operational risk and

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,460
realized value

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,440
so let's focus on visibility

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,480
at the beginning of a product life cycle

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,500
in a traditional model we're going to

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,519
have high visibility we're creating that

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,360
documentation we're showing the customer

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,580
liaising with the customer and what it

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,799
is we're going to going to create

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,979
and then at the end of the product cycle

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,140
we also have high visibility right the

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,880
customer's got a delivered usable

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,500
working product that solves their

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,180
business problem right that would be the

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,439
expectation at the end of that that time

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,920
period but in between those two points

37
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,720
we largely go dark right there might be

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,060
touch points with the customer we're

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,880
going to show you the documentation uh

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,259
we have little demos that we might do of

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,540
different parts of the product in

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,280
isolation but they don't really get a

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,280
holistic visibility about what's going

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,159
on where we are

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,159
we're just telling them so we tend to go

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,740
fairly low visibility not to zero right

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,079
but fairly low visibility and then at

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,240
the end of the product cycle it jumps up

49
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,640
as we deliver a usable working product

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,040
however for visibility in an empirical

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,479
model we're actually going to start in

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,479
exactly the same place and we're going

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,459
to end in exactly the same place right

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,479
we have high visibility at the end

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,400
because they've got a usable working

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,200
product we've got high visibility at the

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
start because we've got documentation

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,200
potentially right but

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,440
at the end of every single iteration

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
we're going to be providing

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,680
the customer

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,540
with a usable working product right

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
that's how we mitigate risk it's the

64
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,920
minimum bar for an empirical process a

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,000
minimum bar for scrum is a usable

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,959
working product at the end of every

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,120
Sprint

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,099
so in fact during

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,420
each iteration we've got that low

70
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,560
visibility

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,980
but we jump back up on a regular Cadence

72
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,500
as we're delivering

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,680
usable working product to the customer

74
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,780
so they get these many touch points

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
where they're able to make assertions

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,000
change direction and have a different

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,720
understanding of what's going on

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,239
now let's look at our ability to change

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,420
our ability to change I would quantify

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,480
that as our

81
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,360
the implications and our ability to

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,599
accept change into the system right

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
we're creating product so as we build

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,640
more product we have less ability to

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,019
change because each change has a bigger

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,860
and bigger impact

87
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,099
and in a traditional model our ability

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:35,780
to change is very high at the start and

89
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,640
at the end it's very low right we have

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,319
if we finish the product we've spent our

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,700
12 months working on it we've delivered

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,680
the usable working product we've

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,959
deployed it to production we know no

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,400
longer and have an ability to to change

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,420
it unless there's more funding more

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,440
budget

97
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,299
but very quickly as we get started

98
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,879
building the documentation the more

99
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,180
documentation we build

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,739
the more impact change has right a small

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,659
change could have a massive impact on

102
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,659
all the documentation we've created

103
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,940
so our ability to to change drops very

104
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,920
quickly and then we start actually

105
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,900
Building Product and perhaps we build

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,420
the entire database first or we build

107
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,139
the database and then the mid tier right

108
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,060
and then the uh uh interface that

109
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,400
customers are going to interact with and

110
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,620
we're building it constantly and we've

111
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,840
kind of started everything so our

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,240
ability to change drops again it never

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,639
drops to zero right

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,220
um but throughout the life of the

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,259
product it stays very low so it drops

116
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,600
very quickly and then stays very low

117
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,460
across the life of the product

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
our ability to change in the empirical

119
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,560
model again starts in the same place and

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,979
finishes in the same place right we've

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,259
got a Time limited uh product cycle but

122
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,280
what happens during that product cycle

123
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,280
is our ability to change remains higher

124
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,699
right higher it's still going to drop

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,100
right because every time we deliver a

126
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,259
usable working product the things that

127
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,720
we've already built are harder to change

128
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,460
than things we haven't built yet but

129
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,979
because we're building in those vertical

130
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,479
slices creating working usable product

131
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,440
that the customer can deploy to

132
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:23,880
production each of those vertical slices

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,979
allows the other uh uh 90 right at the

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,139
end of Sprint one the rest of the

135
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,300
backlog the stuff we've not created yet

136
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,699
can really can change anything they want

137
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,960
with very little impact right because we

138
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,820
haven't built copious amounts of

139
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,380
documentation we haven't built copious

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
amounts of product yet so they can

141
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,180
change anything they want

142
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,000
so the idea is that the ability to

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,780
change is still going to drop Sprint on

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,340
Sprint but it does remain much higher

145
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,620
all the way through the life of the

146
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,820
product and obviously ends in the same

147
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,380
place now let's look at operational risk

148
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,900
an operational risk in a traditional

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,520
model we're going to start high

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,380
operational risk right because we've not

151
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,539
delivered anything and then when we

152
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,060
deliver our usable working product at

153
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,820
the end of our product cycle 12 months

154
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,440
we're going to have a zero operational

155
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,060
risk because we've deployed a working

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,979
product for them

157
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,800
I know there's an assumption there but

158
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,000
uh let's let's assume the best

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,740
um and then over the life of the product

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,139
we've actually got very high operational

161
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,419
risk if we're six months into our

162
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,819
product cycle what operational risk for

163
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,460
the customer have we alleviated zero

164
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,560
right no operational risk so it needs to

165
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,900
remain high during the life of the

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,020
product and then right at the end we

167
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,600
deliver that working usable version of

168
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,360
the product right so we alleviate all of

169
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,759
their operational risk in one big chunk

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,300
in an empirical process for operational

171
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,660
risk again we start high and again we

172
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,180
finish low but every Sprint we're

173
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,000
providing a usable working product

174
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,620
so the operational risk gets a little

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,720
bit less

176
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,460
at the end of Sprint 2 it gets a little

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,740
bit less again because we've delivered

178
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,100
usable working product that solves their

179
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,160
business problem and we end up with that

180
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,880
straight line from top left to bottom

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,580
right

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,400
right every Sprint we're alleviating

183
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,699
some of that operational risk now in

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,940
reality we should alleviate it quicker

185
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,580
if we as a team are focusing on

186
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,919
delivering the most valuable

187
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,419
things that that customer needs to know

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,940
first

189
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:39,840
so that operational risk

190
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,639
might might be more

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,560
of a curve

192
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,720
but let's assume it's a it's a straight

193
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,520
line let's take a pessimistic view that

194
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,680
each Sprint we just alleviated that

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,740
Sprint's operational risk

196
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,259
finally let's talk about realized value

197
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,259
the delivery of value to the customer

198
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,060
so in a traditional model and we have

199
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,340
zero value at the start of the product

200
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,880
cycle we deliver a working product to

201
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,699
production at the end so we have our our

202
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,580
usable uh working product that perhaps

203
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,060
we delivered our 300 features that the

204
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,580
customer asked for and and

205
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,560
how do we how do we get there well we're

206
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,020
only delivering to production at the end

207
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,580
right the customer can only use the

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,120
product once it's in production it only

209
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,440
adds value once it's in production so in

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,419
fact we're not delivering anything

211
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,520
during the life of the project and then

212
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,320
right at the end they get their usable

213
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,719
working product obviously it always

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,959
works with their 300 features in it that

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,820
are exactly what they asked for and uh

216
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,760
they're they're happy because they got

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,800
that realized value at the end

218
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,339
but maybe there's a better way

219
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,100
because what did we learn a little bit

220
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,620
earlier in this discussion we learned

221
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,600
that 35

222
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,519
of those features are used by the

223
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,959
customer at the end of that product

224
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:09,720
cycle only 35 percent right that's like

225
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:12,120
90 100 110 of those 300 items are

226
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,060
actually used at the end of the product

227
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,220
cycle that's not particularly great so

228
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,800
what could we do instead

229
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,040
using an empirical process there's

230
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:27,060
actually two ways to draw this graph one

231
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,160
is that we're going to start at zero

232
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,740
value just the same and we're going to

233
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,200
end at those 300 features

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,600
so this assumes that we're doing an

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,399
empirical process inside of a

236
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,560
traditional organization or working for

237
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,660
a traditional customer the customer says

238
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,420
here's these 300 features we've added

239
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,680
them to the contract right and then

240
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,420
that's what we're going to build and

241
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
we're not going to very low variance of

242
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,660
change right because we're going to put

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,200
barriers in their way like change

244
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,700
request boards and uh cost you know

245
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,779
having to do a business case to make a

246
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,120
change all of those things we're gonna

247
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,320
we're gonna just deliver those 300

248
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,360
features

249
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
but at the end of every Sprint we're

250
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
actually able

251
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,839
to deliver them some value right so at

252
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,779
the end of each Sprint

253
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,459
here is some value here's a product that

254
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,260
you can deploy to production that solves

255
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,640
some of your business problem right not

256
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,779
all of it but some of your business

257
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,120
problem

258
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,640
and every single

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,880
old Sprint we're delivering a working

260
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,360
usable product along that line

261
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,480
right so the customer is able

262
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,700
to get value from it sooner so if you

263
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,339
think about the the realization of value

264
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,220
at the end of Sprint three they've got

265
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,500
three Sprints worth of value

266
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,899
how much of their business problem is

267
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,959
alleviated already and we're not at the

268
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,459
12 month Mark 12 month Mark where one

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,140
quarter of the way through the product

270
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:57,000
cycle and we've we've alleviated one

271
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,040
quarter of the business problem right

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,959
they're adding value as we go along so

273
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,480
they've had the value for longer is what

274
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,620
I mean it's not sitting on a Shelf

275
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,760
because we're able to deploy to

276
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,240
production

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,420
but there's indeed a superpower there

278
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,399
because only 35 percent of those 300

279
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,440
features are used so we actually don't

280
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,940
want to build those those 300 features

281
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,680
we want to build a different 300

282
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,180
features right even if we just get to

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,940
that 300 mark

284
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,200
so what happens is at the end of Sprint

285
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,079
one

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
we remove things from the backlog that

287
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,980
we no longer need perhaps the customer

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,079
has realized that they asked for stuff

289
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,519
they don't need perhaps the Market's

290
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,740
changed and they no longer need that

291
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,200
perhaps a business decision has been

292
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,440
made right there's a branching decision

293
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,240
this way was one set of 100 features

294
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,680
this way was another set of 100 features

295
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,360
so they added them all to the backlog

296
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,740
but now they've made that decision and

297
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,380
it's this one so we can delete these

298
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,060
hundreds right so we delete those things

299
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,640
and we don't build

300
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,060
some of those things and we take it in a

301
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,500
different direction right we add more

302
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,940
value

303
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,140
sooner in the product cycle as we go and

304
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:15,000
perhaps we hit that Mark of the same 35

305
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,100
percent of value much sooner perhaps we

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,820
hit it in month five

307
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,399
right we could stop there and have

308
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,040
delivered the same value that we would

309
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,360
have delivered in a traditional model

310
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,200
but at

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,480
5 12 of The Price my Math's not good

312
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,300
right 5 12 of the price

313
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,560
but what often happens is in the product

314
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,560
cycle we continue

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,579
to build features

316
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,620
different features based on the needs of

317
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,660
the business based on collaborating with

318
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,660
customers and stakeholders and we add

319
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,519
way more value to the product

320
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,820
that's if we're using an empirical

321
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,100
process within an organization within a

322
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,839
structure that is accepting of that

323
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,380
level of change

324
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,500
and that is what we want to get from an

325
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,600
agile process so even using an agile

326
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,019
process inside of a traditional

327
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,019
organization we get value we maximize

328
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,760
visibility we maximize our ability to

329
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,040
respond to the changing needs of the

330
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,660
customer we minimize their operational

331
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,459
risk and we continually deliver

332
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,680
value that that customer can amortize

333
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,079
over time right

334
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,360
those are the superpowers of agile even

335
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,339
within a traditional organization if we

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,600
can change the organization as well we

337
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,600
can get even more

338
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,180
well thanks very much for listening if

339
