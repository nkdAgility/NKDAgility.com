In the world of Agile, the statistics speak volumes. According to the Standish Group's Chaos Report, small projects with fewer than 50 participants are 30% more likely to succeed when employing Agile practices. Even more striking, larger projects with over 50 people see a staggering 200% increase in their chances of success. This data underscores the transformative power of Agile methodologies, and today, I want to delve into the key differences that make this possible.

As a Professional Scrum Trainer with Scrum.org and a Professional Kanban Trainer with Pro Kanban, I’ve spent over 14 years as a Microsoft MVP in DevOps. My journey has taught me that understanding the nuances between traditional and empirical models is crucial for maximising project success. Let’s explore this through the lenses of visibility, change, operational risk, and realised value.

### Visibility: The Light and Dark of Project Cycles

In a traditional model, visibility is high at the beginning and end of a product lifecycle. We start with extensive documentation and customer engagement, ensuring everyone is aligned on what’s to come. However, as we progress, we often go dark. Touchpoints may dwindle, and stakeholders are left in the dark about the project's status until the final delivery. This can lead to misalignment and unmet expectations.

Conversely, in an empirical model, we maintain high visibility throughout. While we may experience low visibility during the development phases, we provide stakeholders with a usable working product at the end of every iteration. This regular cadence of delivery allows for ongoing feedback and adjustments, ensuring that the project remains aligned with customer needs.

### Change: Embracing Flexibility

The ability to change is another critical factor. In traditional models, we start with a high capacity for change, but as we build, that capacity diminishes. Each new feature or piece of documentation adds complexity, making changes increasingly difficult. By the end of the project, our ability to adapt is severely limited.

In contrast, the empirical model allows for greater flexibility throughout the lifecycle. While our capacity to change does decrease as we build, it remains significantly higher than in traditional approaches. By delivering in vertical slices, we can pivot based on customer feedback without incurring massive costs or delays.

### Operational Risk: A Gradual Alleviation

Operational risk is another area where the two models diverge. In a traditional approach, we start with high operational risk, which only drops to zero at the end of the project when we deliver the final product. This means that for much of the project, the customer is left with no alleviation of risk.

In an empirical model, we begin with high operational risk, but with each sprint, we deliver usable products that gradually reduce that risk. This continuous delivery not only alleviates risk but also builds trust with stakeholders, as they see tangible progress throughout the project.

### Realised Value: Delivering Incrementally

Finally, let’s discuss realised value. In a traditional model, value is delivered only at the end of the project, often resulting in a situation where the customer finds that only a fraction of the features they requested are actually used. This can lead to disappointment and wasted resources.

With an empirical approach, we can deliver value incrementally. By providing usable products at the end of each sprint, we allow customers to start realising value much sooner. This not only enhances satisfaction but also enables us to pivot based on what the customer truly needs, rather than what they initially requested.

### Conclusion: The Superpowers of Agile

The superpowers of Agile methodologies are evident, even within traditional organisations. By maximising visibility, embracing change, minimising operational risk, and delivering value incrementally, we can transform the way we approach projects. 

If you’re interested in diving deeper into the principles of Agile, I highly recommend reading "The New New Product Development Game," a classic article from the Harvard Business Review, and Stephen Denning's "The Age of Agile."
