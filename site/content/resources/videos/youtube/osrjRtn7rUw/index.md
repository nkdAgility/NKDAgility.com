 🧠 CTO Peer Pressure: When Everyone Else Is Doing It… Should You?
🎥 Episode 8 of 10 — Now Playing

📍“Just because your competitor adopted Kubernetes… doesn’t mean you should.”

In the boardroom, the pressure is real:
💼 “Why aren’t we using what they’re using?”
📢 Vendors shouting.
📈 Case studies everywhere.

Suddenly, your roadmap feels shaky—and everyone is asking if you’re falling behind.

🚫 That’s not strategy.
That’s pressure.

At NKD Agility, we help CTOs push back with evidence—not emotion:
🧩 Make your current systems visible
🎯 Identify what’s actually slowing you down
🧠 Evaluate tech based on fit, not FOMO

We ask:
→ Does it align with your business goals?
→ Will your teams thrive with it?
→ Does it solve a real problem—or just look good in a pitch deck?

With that clarity, you can walk into any room and defend your roadmap—confidently, deliberately, and on your terms. Visit https://nkdagility.com

👇 Watch now. Follow for the full 10-part series.
