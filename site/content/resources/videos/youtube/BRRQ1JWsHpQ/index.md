{{< youtube BRRQ1JWsHpQ >}} 
 In 2020 when #covid19 hit with full force, many teams were thrown into disarray as working remotely became the norm rather than the exception.

It also impacted #scrumtraining something fierce with #professionalscrumtrainers now delivering courses remotely rather than in-person in classrooms.

It did produce some massive upside in the form of new digital tools and resources that really allow the training to land, promote collaboration, and serve as a digital repository for learning and self-improvement.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about how some of the digital tools and resources used in #scrumtraining translate into new tools and online resources delegates use long after the training has ended.
