1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,559
well the question is the tools you use

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,500
to train are awesome how do people

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,900
transfer their training experience

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,900
with these tools into their job

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,500
they need to try stuff that that's the

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,600
thing that I kind of try and encourage

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,240
people to do and it's one of the

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,820
particular reasons that I talk about

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,640
how I run different segments of the

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,020
class that met a conversation about how

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
I run different segments of the class

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,440
with them as well as actually running

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,239
the class I guess it depends on the

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,820
group as well right if you've got a

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,040
bunch of practitioners and scrum Masters

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,660
and facilitators who are interested in

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,600
that stuff I maybe spent more time on it

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,700
than than other classes

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,160
but those

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,840
um those tools like the different

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,160
flavors of liberating structures for the

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,140
virtual world are things that they can

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
take away and use in their own

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,740
organization to help them make their

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,619
environments a little bit better to help

26
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,820
people engage and and tell stories a

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,280
little bit better inside of their

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,280
organization because that's really how

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,260
humans connect information to the real

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,880
world is through stories

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,799
and how do you tell your stories in a

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,500
way that helps other people inside of

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,759
your organization understand them

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,680
um

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,840
so some examples of of tools uh one of

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,659
one of the key and it's one of the the

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,479
foundational Tools in

38
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,780
um in liberating structures is the the

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,460
it's called a one two four all it's a

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,560
great tool

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,780
um where you do one minute on your own

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,280
two minutes in pairs four minutes and

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,299
two pairs and then bringing everybody

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,479
back and the the core goal is always

45
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,799
I've got a group of people they're not a

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,079
tiny group of people there may be a

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,299
bigger group of people and I want them

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,799
to engage on a particular topic and come

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,200
up with ideas

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,640
but I don't want to just ask the room

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,800
let's say you've got 20 people in the

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,540
room I don't want to just ask the room

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,180
um what do you think about this topic

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,459
because you know already before you ask

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,660
the question the one either nobody's

56
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,300
gonna say anything and it's going to be

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,780
tumbleweeds going past right or you've

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,400
got that one person who you know is the

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,140
loudest person in the room they're going

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,300
to be the only one that speaks or the

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,060
hippo in the room right the highest paid

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,520
person uh is going to be the one that

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,599
that that that talks and everybody else

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,300
can be like I don't want to see anything

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,040
in case the you know get in trouble

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,500
so how do you create an environment

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,560
where everybody's voice is is equally

68
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,800
contributing to the story and enable all

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,319
of them even if it's just they feel like

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,120
they're involved in the conversation

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,420
that they're getting getting their

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,379
stories across so one minute on your own

73
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,440
right is everybody heads down write some

74
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,140
ideas on your own and then you go into

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,300
Pairs and this is this is this is my

76
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,780
interpretation of this based on based on

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,940
my personality right but I feel like I'm

78
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,560
an introvert maybe it doesn't seem that

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,560
way but I am

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,540
um I'm an introvert and having one

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,300
person to go speak to

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,400
and express my ideas to is great right

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,239
because I'm not talking to a big room of

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,700
people I don't feel like I'm going to be

85
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,680
ashamed by people and people in the room

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,540
who don't like my idea but I can share

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,640
it in this small group and then we

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,560
shared our ideas we've collaborated in

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,659
our ideas it's only two minutes right

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,599
but you get that feeling and then you go

91
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,760
into two pairs so that's two friends

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,260
right people who have made friends and

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,560
collaborated on their ideas coming

94
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,760
together to to expand those ideas and

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
make them bigger

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,980
and then when you bring it back to the

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,180
rest of the room you've maybe only got

98
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,000
three four or five groups of people

99
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,120
to hear from and you're healing hearing

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
collaboratively created ideas so it's

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,260
it's okay to have a spokesperson in that

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,060
group and everybody else doesn't feel

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,260
like they're not being heard right

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,000
because they've already had those

105
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,900
conversations and built up to that story

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,880
and that that's just one of the tools in

107
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,979
liberating structures and you can also

108
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,720
take what what do we do with the output

109
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,360
of that well maybe we feed it into

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,580
something else that we use to you know

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,320
we've created a whole list of ideas and

112
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,180
perhaps we want to figure out

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,460
how do we get through that growing zone

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,759
in the middle of of of collaboration and

115
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,800
coming to consensus towards having that

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,960
back consensus and single idea like what

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,139
is it we're going to do do next

118
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,440
so so helping people understand how

119
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,199
those tools work in their world they can

120
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,419
experience using some of those tools in

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,940
the class and then hopefully they can

122
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,800
see how they function so that they can

123
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,440
then take them and use them in their own

124
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,380
facilitation techniques as well and

125
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,400
because I I I feel like I specialize in

126
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:21,000
the virtual space I feel like most

127
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,520
people are in either hybrid or all

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,180
virtual environments today

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,639
and there's no point I feel there's less

130
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,639
value in you coming to an in-person

131
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,979
class and me teaching you how to run all

132
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,539
these liberating structures or or using

133
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,460
them you seeing those liberating

134
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,320
structures being used in the physical

135
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,820
space and then you go back to work and

136
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,139
there's three people online and two

137
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,699
people in the office and you're like

138
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,940
well I can't use that thing that Martin

139
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,560
used because it doesn't fit the space

140
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,860
that I'm in just now

141
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,780
whereas if you come to a virtual class

142
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,840
you're going to learn how to do that in

143
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,300
the virtual space and we've all seen if

144
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,100
you're in the hybrid world is really the

145
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,080
same as the virtual world except a few

146
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,580
people are in the office and they go sit

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,919
at their desk and everybody has their

148
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,020
own camera and their own so you can do

149
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,380
the breakout rooms you can do use those

150
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,740
tools and that's also partly you know

151
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,860
using using the the Technologies as well

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,419
that we use in the class we use mural in

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,560
my classes we use mural and Microsoft

154
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,180
teams

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
um enable people to then go back to the

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,639
office and use similar techniques again

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
additional meta learning from the class

158
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,780
where they're able to learn more than

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,819
the content that we're actually teaching

160
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,960
them because they're learning how to

161
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,639
actually

162
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,639
do those things through experience

163
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,000
