**One thing a client can do to ensure a successful Agile consulting engagement**

So, the first thing that comes to mind when asked this question is a one-word answer: ' provoke'.  🤔

I think the most powerful successful Agile Consultant can do is to provoke, push and nudge their customer towards a different way of thinking and a different understanding. 

## Rethinking Agile

Never underestimate the power of provocation.  I know for sure that as an Agile consultant, the most impactful thing I can do for my clients is _provoke_ them.

Yes, you heard that right!

I am here to push, nudge, and even elbow them towards a different way of thinking about their product development operations. 🔄👀

It's key to get clients to just think about _what_ it is they're doing, _how_ they're doing it and _why_ they're doing it that way. 💡

### Why the word 'provoke?'

You may be wondering why I use the word provoke, as this word often has aggressive connotations.  But I used this strong word in this case because it can be very difficult to get clients to rethink their mindset.

It's also often challenging for clients to confront the issues that may be hindering their operations.  They might think everything is great, but the reality could be far from it.  My job is to provide a fresh perspective, challenge their established views, and move them out of their comfort zone. 💼🔍

Don't get me wrong.

When I talk about the word provoke, it's not to criticise but to stimulate change, to prompt introspection, and to catalyse improvement.

It's all about asking the tough questions, such as:

What are we doing?  How are we doing it?  Why are we doing it this way?  It's about paving the path towards more efficient, Agile ways of operating. 🎯
