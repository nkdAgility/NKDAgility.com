1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,500
so one thing uh that a client can do to

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,639
ensure a successful agile Consulting

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,259
engagement is to be prepared to be

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,000
provoked

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,820
I think that's probably the most

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,859
powerful thing that a consultant can do

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,800
is provoke push nudge their customer in

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,320
a different way of thinking a different

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,560
understanding or even to just think

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,239
about what it is that they're doing how

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,120
they're doing it and why they're doing

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,579
it that way and the reason I use the

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,120
word provoke is because it it can be

14
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:48,200
very difficult and hard for them to hear

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,960
the things that might be incorrect wrong

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,120
or just that need fixing that they think

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,420
they're doing it great and it's really

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,420
not
