So one thing that a client can do to ensure a successful agile consulting engagement is to be prepared to be provoked. 

I think that's probably the most powerful thing that a consultant can do is provoke, push, nudge their customer in a different way of thinking, a different understanding, or even to just think about what it is that they're doing, how they're doing it, and why they're doing it that way. 

And the reason I use the word provoke is because it can be very difficult and hard for them to hear the things that might be incorrect, wrong, or just that need fixing, that they think they're doing it great and it's really not.
