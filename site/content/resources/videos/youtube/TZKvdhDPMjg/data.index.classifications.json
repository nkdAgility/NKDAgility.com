However, it does not explicitly lay out clear principles or foundational beliefs, and is more focused on the actions of the consultant rather than outlining systemic principles. The discussion is not detailed enough to fully qualify as a primary focus on principles, which affects the confidence score.",

There is no direct mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor are SLE concepts (such as cycle time ranges, probability thresholds, or Kanban/Scrum SLE forecasting) discussed. The intent is broadly related to Agile improvement and coaching, not specific SLE guidance. Audience alignment and signal-to-noise are relatively higher because it targets Agile practitioners and is focused without much tangential content, but the lack of SLE reference or analytical depth makes the overall fit to this category extremely weak. No penalties were applied, as the content is current and maintains an appropriate tone.",
