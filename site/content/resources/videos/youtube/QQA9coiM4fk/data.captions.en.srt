1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,480
so what what what is it this can this

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,700
devops Consulting thing that we offered

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,279
um I've been doing devops consulting for

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,300
quite some time

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,060
um I started back in 2010 when I moved

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,859
to the US providing as a devops

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,779
consultant I was employed as a devops

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,480
consultant by a boutique consulting

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,099
company in the US in Seattle

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,140
and I did Consulting for three years

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,880
operating out of there and when I moved

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
back to the UK I started offering that

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,340
that service to to myself to other

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,160
customers and it really takes a bunch of

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,940
different forms right some of it is just

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,320
helping people understand devops so I do

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,379
I do presentations I do workshops I do

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,059
just conversations right around devops

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,980
what it is what it means to

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,180
organizations

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,640
um quite often that's with leadership

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,600
teams it depends depends who who turns

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,000
up right but I also also offer a lot of

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,360
or to have done a lot of Consulting in

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,700
the Azure devops space a lot because of

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,920
my background as a Microsoft MVP in

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,260
devops right within your devops space

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,020
and my history with the Azure devops

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,240
team and Azure devops Consulting

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,920
um so quite a lot of people that come to

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,960
me definitely have a a a Microsoft tint

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,880
in their way of working it's not

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,439
exclusive right it's not required but

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
that's that quite often happens if

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,380
you're known as an expert in a

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,600
particular tool then people tend to

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,400
gravitate towards you that way which is

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,979
a lot of fun and I love talking about

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Azure devops and how it works so some of

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,900
that Consulting is tool based right what

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,520
is azure devops how does it work how can

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,920
it help an organization how can they use

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,439
it better how can they uh help people

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,840
and their teams adopt it better

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,700
um but the tools and techniques the

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,259
techniques that I talk about are can be

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,740
applied to any tool whether you're using

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,780
jira right or team City these are all

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,940
tools that I've worked with and helped

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,599
companies with as well

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,459
um

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,560
and

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,860
as your devops Consulting kind of takes

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,260
a number of forms because there's a bit

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,640
in potentially understanding what it is

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,800
that you're you're doing some

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,620
organizations want

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,420
um like a report right where are we are

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,300
we actually doing devops do we actually

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,000
generally understand what it is

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,400
um and I've come in and done uh uh they

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,480
used to be called dpses Microsoft had a

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,120
name for it because there was some

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
funding for it for for Enterprises uh

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,420
deployment planning services and

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,519
effectively it's it's a state of devops

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,440
report what is the current state of

68
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,260
devops in your organization and I would

69
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,060
come in uh spend a week with folks in

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,319
your organization interviewing them

71
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,860
talking about how they're building

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,920
products uh uh their ways of working

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,480
um and then I would build up report on

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,940
what's the current state of devops in

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,260
your organization and uh what are the

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,819
things that you're going to need to

77
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,260
tackle what are the opportunities for

78
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,700
improvement places where things aren't

79
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,680
going so well

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,780
um and what if you only did three things

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,400
what are the top three things that's

82
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,440
quite a common one I've done that a lot

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,360
both devops and agile right that's

84
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,620
that's the same same story Works in both

85
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,300
places

86
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,879
um but ultimately

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,580
Consulting is about coming in and

88
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,400
actually provoking change inside of an

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,879
organization so the most common thing

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,879
that I do is just coming in and talking

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,680
to folks got one recently

92
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,200
um kind of on a little bit of a retainer

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,840
with a with a large manufacturing

94
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,280
organization in Switzerland they're all

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,319
over the place but the people I work

96
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,379
with are in Switzerland

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,659
um and we we we we talk that's that's

98
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:54,239
really all it is for for from my

99
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,159
perspective we talk I answer questions

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,500
we engage on different topics we

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,180
understand how talking about how they're

102
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,680
doing work how they could maybe change

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,360
the way they do work how could they

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,420
change the way they do the work better

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,340
then they go off and try things in their

106
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,840
organization they change the way they do

107
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,299
things see if it works for them and then

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,360
come back for another session with more

109
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,840
more feedback more ideas more problems

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,579
and we discuss and and figure them out

111
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,560
um I have quite a few customers that are

112
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,580
in that that that that category so

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,220
that's that's

114
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,139
the devops Consulting

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,900
um I also provide some technical help

116
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,440
and support that's maybe something of of

117
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,220
note I actually still write code today

118
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,280
that's Martin still writes code yep uh I

119
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,220
I I uh builds built

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,800
support and maintain a product that

121
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,160
allows you to migrate data around in

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,020
Azure devops so taking a project and

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,699
splitting it or merging projects

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,840
whatever it is that you want to be able

125
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,120
to do

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,880
um been working around since 2016 before

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,060
then 2015 2016s when I started that that

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,280
product and lots of people use it so

129
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,500
sometimes they have questions about how

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,419
they should use it what capabilities

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,800
does it have

132
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,660
um can they get any help and support

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
with it do they can they get training

134
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,479
for it so I do provide that as well and

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,280
I kind of include that in devops right

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,680
because it's part of that that they're

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,199
they're doing devops stuff and they want

138
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,180
help with their devops stuff

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,720
um so really it's quite broad devops is

140
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,580
this very broad Consulting area where

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,960
um I might just talk to people or I

142
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,400
might go all the way to helping them

143
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,220
with their tooling and helping them

144
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,620
figure out how to use it better
