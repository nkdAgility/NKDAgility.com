00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:35,830
[Music]

2
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:37,990
oh my name's Martin Intuit I'm a

3
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,140
professional scum trainer with scrum the

4
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:46,180
dark as well as a Microsoft MVP I'm here

5
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:50,290
in Scotland and my good friend Jim is

6
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,670
over in where are you Jim I'm in the

7
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,680
United States in the Midwest

8
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,330
Midwest Ohio Ohio okay so that's if

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,360
there's a delay or there's a problem

10
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,369
that might be because of the internet

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,470
isn't this about that well this is kind

12
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:10,539
of just after lunch in the US yeah it's

13
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,010
three o'clock my time here everybody's

14
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:21,970
know Netflix yet probably within the

15
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:26,950
hour or so so I am interested in the

16
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:30,790
question that you had for me the other

17
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,959
day could you give me that you remember

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:39,670
what it was yeah so I got a call from a

19
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,370
colleague of mine who is on the agile

20
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,590
journey let's say and his current

21
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,840
struggle is from a technical perspective

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,989
so he has a number of development teams

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,410
and his his developers just don't

24
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,799
they're not thinking in an agile manner

25
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,140
they are not validating and getting good

26
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,510
feedback from customers and frankly to

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,470
be honest the biggest thing is they just

28
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,200
don't seem to really care about bad

29
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,880
quality going out the door or not

30
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,110
meeting the customers needs and these

31
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,090
are internal customers and a corporation

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:22,030
but you know he was asking me how would

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,940
you train development team members on

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,970
agile and scrum and that was really

35
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,489
where I reached out to you because my

36
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,290
expertise is more around product

37
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,690
ownership and scrum mastery than it is

38
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,060
working you know in teaching development

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,390
skills yeah I don't think this is an

40
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,070
evolved

41
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,850
no problem but I'm curious to hear what

42
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:45,250
you think yeah I was I was literally

43
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,470
just thinking that I was thinking that

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,200
it doesn't sound like a development

45
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:55,960
skill problem

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:04:00,820
I find that in engineers tend to be

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:03,070
reasonably smart people um and the

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,760
reason you might have a problem is

49
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:10,300
because they're they're disengaged from

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:15,220
work so just like you would expect a

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:18,940
product owner or scrum master to step up

52
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,990
and um maybe being a little bit I don't

53
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,890
know what the word is blunt maybe step

54
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,350
up and do their job I also suspect an

55
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,220
engineering team to step up and do

56
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,870
theirs but if they're disengaged with

57
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:41,520
the work that tends to be a cultural

58
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:44,290
problem yeah and that's really where my

59
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,580
comments to him when is you know we can

60
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,890
do technical practices we can teach TDD

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,410
we can do pair programming and mob

62
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,770
programming sessions and we can talk

63
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,870
about you know iterative design and

64
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,000
emergent design and all that but really

65
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,040
it seems like how do you get people to

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,450
care and how do you get them to care

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,580
about quality and have some pride in

68
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,500
workmanship pride and craftsmanship and

69
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,750
the interesting thing about that is

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,090
their business is very manufacturing

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,430
focused so they are used to delivering

72
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,530
end products like tangible goods to

73
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:22,290
customers so I think there's some

74
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,550
interesting analogies there around

75
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,860
caring about quality and customer

76
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:35,200
feedback and you know kind of that that

77
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,669
aspect of software craftsmanship is

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,820
definitely a difficult one because if

79
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:43,390
you do have people the are technically

80
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,190
competent it's it's always possible that

81
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,790
you don't but if you do have people that

82
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,310
are technically come

83
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:54,350
and then it comes down to the the X the

84
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,990
intrinsic motivations rather than

85
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:02,480
extrinsic motivations and you'll be

86
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:04,520
familiar with Dan Pink's book drive and

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,180
talking about autonomy mastery and

88
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,290
purpose and that's usually where I would

89
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:17,210
start for an engineering team is um look

90
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:24,170
at what are they lacking in those three

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:28,160
things right yeah that's good

92
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:30,020
I could I've spent quite a bit at a time

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
with some of these teams so I think I

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,710
could take a few guesses but I mean it

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,570
would be presumptuous of me to know at

96
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:41,390
the individual level but I think at the

97
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:45,710
high level their autonomy is probably

98
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:49,040
not great in their per their sense of

99
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,840
purpose is probably a pretty low the

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,580
thing I don't know the dimension I don't

101
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,030
know is their mastery because I know

102
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,070
that you know here the the feeling of I

103
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,490
need a two pair program with experience

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,070
out and developers to teach them skills

105
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,860
so I think there's two aspects to it I

106
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:10,370
think there's a technical concern that

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:16,790
they're not great developers and then I

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:19,600
think mindset can people to care how do

109
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,600
you teach people do

110
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,870
think

111
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,310
soles and Keith doesn't mind their work

112
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,810
yeah exactly you were breaking up a

113
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,560
little bit there it wasn't too bad I

114
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,710
think it was an internet issue that's

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,570
just the world we live in

116
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:47,160
yeah and I'm sure I'm sure it'll be in

117
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:52,120
fine as we go ya know I've noticed a few

118
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:55,200
things have happened recently and that's

119
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,280
that I decided I wanted another webcam

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,810
because I have I have another monitor

121
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,210
over here and when I'm looking at this

122
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:07,330
monitor it looks like I'm not looking at

123
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:08,110
you yeah and I went to by having to buy

124
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:16,030
a webcam

125
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:21,130
yeah and there aren't any left no no

126
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,200
hair clippers either oh yeah this is

127
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,940
this is terrible this is the worst mine

128
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,280
has been in years

129
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,740
yeah my wife's been complaining quite a

130
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,180
lot but we just don't have Clippers

131
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,340
she's got a pair of scissors but I don't

132
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,669
know if I want to let her have a goal

133
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:40,150
with a pair of scissors yeah interesting

134
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:44,800
stop yeah you know who's still got

135
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:48,370
Clippers in stock I bet two pet stores

136
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,760
nice stores stores yeah that's a good

137
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,800
point

138
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,750
I was at a pet store over the weekend

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,430
and then they had a whole shelf load of

140
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,440
Clippers so yeah it is interesting I

141
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,090
read an interesting article which I

142
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,870
guess is part meant for the type of work

143
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:07,690
that we do in floor as to why there's so

144
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:13,650
many shortages and the article was

145
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:18,220
talking about the the the flow of goods

146
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:20,880
has more than one channel so for example

147
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,240
for toilet paper which is currently

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,130
substantially missing from shelves and

149
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,180
lots of there are companies that make

150
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,980
commercial grade toilet paper and those

151
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,280
don't make it onto the supermarket

152
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,920
shelves and we're no longer using

153
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,089
commercial grade

154
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,790
toilet paper those distribution channels

155
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:45,500
are empty you know they've got all the

156
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,010
toilet paper but nobody to use them and

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:55,070
the the EM was it the opposite of

158
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:57,199
commercial the public consumer consumer

159
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,010
is looking for thank you the consumer

160
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:03,529
chains are getting overloaded because of

161
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,730
just that switch so there everybody's

162
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,350
making the same amount of toilet paper

163
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:12,800
we're just using it differently yeah I

164
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,130
think this is akin to like the nineteen

165
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,980
forties where new markets are gonna pop

166
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,720
up so things that were used to dispose

167
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,769
of we're now gonna be like what can we

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,810
use this for and then so there's gonna

169
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,670
be this use of byproducts and it'll be

170
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:33,610
really interesting to see if we kind of

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,899
kick off this second self-sustaining

172
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,389
generation this of you know being

173
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,970
self-sufficient and eating what you grow

174
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,220
and and using the most of everything and

175
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,600
this could be an amazing shift away from

176
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,970
rampant consumerism but it's funny I did

177
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,010
a consumer products company last year

178
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,620
and I feel that right now there is the

179
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,019
data science experiment going on in

180
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,579
every retail store in the world which is

181
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,040
two things

182
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:04,130
it's buying patterns it's so what are

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,949
people buying first in times of hysteria

184
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,949
I am more intrigued by the products that

185
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:13,160
are left on the shelves so what is the

186
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,779
last bag of pretzels bought what is the

187
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,910
last jar of peanut butter

188
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,920
what is the last type of toilet paper to

189
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,290
be grabbed and what would influence

190
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,680
those decisions and do companies and

191
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,540
retailers care or what a date of

192
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,459
scientists and I'm not a data scientist

193
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,260
say you know you can't make any

194
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,819
decisions during a time like this

195
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,329
because it's unprecedented and it's not

196
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:39,769
significant from a data perspective

197
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:41,480
because of the hysteria an impulse

198
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,550
nature of things I don't know but to me

199
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,449
it's always shocking to be like look at

200
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,060
all the ketchups

201
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,649
why is that one ketchup left and all the

202
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,050
other ones are gone like what does that

203
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,300
tell that producers in a few

204
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,080
images from people taking pictures in

205
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,500
supermarkets of the vegan aisle in the

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,920
supermarket and everything's still there

207
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,620
I did think that was I noticed it in my

208
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,579
local supermarket as well and that all

209
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,470
of the the meat replacement goods were

210
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:16,040
where all the shelves were fully stocked

211
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,290
and it's funny I did have some recently

212
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,680
and it's pretty tasty it's just not the

213
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:26,959
go-to that people think of when we when

214
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,910
we go shopping yeah yeah yeah I think

215
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,769
again and I don't want to get to like

216
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,040
Phyllis it if you think about which of

217
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:37,040
your principles will be the last to go

218
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,470
and which ones are the first to go so I

219
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,930
I have a friend who's a vegan or was a

220
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,310
vegan and it's like I don't care I'm

221
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,990
eating meat right now because I need

222
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,810
protein and there there are amassing

223
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:53,019
meat so they quickly let that principle

224
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:56,510
go out of for many reasons fear Asteria

225
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:59,779
impulse etcetera but it just is it's

226
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,959
very telling in my opinion I agree and

227
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,790
it depends how how long this goes on for

228
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,860
both of those things you know what's the

229
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:12,410
last what's your last principle to go as

230
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:16,420
well as and whether the data science is

231
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,500
going to have an impact whether changes

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,410
significant changes need to be made to

233
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,920
the the distribution pipeline and I

234
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:28,100
think there are some people I've been

235
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,190
reading some articles people talking

236
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,180
about everything changing and that it

237
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:37,699
will just be different from from now on

238
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,520
but then it hasn't been that different

239
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:43,670
in Asia where they've been through

240
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,110
something like this before they still

241
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:51,370
have rampant consumerism they still have

242
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:55,089
and they probably just wears masks you

243
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,670
see that uh a lot and even just people

244
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,380
wear them anyway when they're out and I

245
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,630
think it is it's going to be interesting

246
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,910
how how long this goes on for what's

247
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:09,190
going to change because um we've got an

248
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:11,200
expectation in the UK from our our what

249
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,950
was he called the the health person in

250
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,579
chief the chief scientist behind some of

251
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,970
the decisions they're making and he says

252
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:28,920
is six to twelve months yeah we're going

253
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:31,120
to be in some kind of restricted set up

254
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,800
they've already said that the schools

255
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
here I don't know what it's been like

256
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,940
for you guys but the schools here aren't

257
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,700
going back till after the summer

258
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,870
holidays so that's August before the

259
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,060
schools go back at the at the earliest

260
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:49,380
and I guess they'll reassess then and

261
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,329
see what's going on but homeschooling is

262
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,220
something that seems to be happening a

263
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:57,820
lot in some places have have their act

264
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,949
together for schools doing some kind of

265
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,930
distance learning and other places

266
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:06,940
they're just emailing some homework and

267
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:09,100
hoping people do it yeah you know I I

268
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,949
had a conversation the other day with a

269
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,510
family member and she was like you know

270
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:17,070
man wouldn't this be I've been great

271
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:21,250
when we were kids and I said no because

272
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:23,010
we'd be bored like when I hear kids

273
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,160
today

274
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:32,520
just want to smack a website there you

275
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,839
have no board in 2020 but

276
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,570
would be different back than like how

277
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,759
would

278
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:42,369
even

279
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,369
if I was in

280
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,760
maybe

281
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,660
working through the drive-through

282
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,149
homework assignments and bring them home

283
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,610
redeliver them but

284
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:59,010
available now that

285
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,910
and exist five

286
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,910
one year

287
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:08,040
so yeah it's it's unprecedented so to

288
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,450
bring it back to what you and I do for a

289
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,360
safety yeah say if we talk about

290
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,630
principles what principles do you think

291
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,250
are even more important now and that

292
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,440
team should focus on and and really

293
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,800
spend a lot of time working to

294
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,610
strengthen given this new I'm calling it

295
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,650
our new Wow

296
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,440
our way of working so give it our new

297
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:38,190
Wow what's more important than ever

298
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:41,550
before I would I would think I'm coming

299
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:45,090
back to to some of the the scrum values

300
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,680
probably makes sense for for me and I

301
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:51,480
think it's gonna be really hard to get

302
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:55,830
and teams to have the same level of

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:59,460
commitment to each other that they can

304
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:02,100
have in person when you can poke the

305
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,840
other person you know that other person

306
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,209
is there when you can't see somebody

307
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,900
you've you've said you'll do something

308
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,300
for is the same level of commitment

309
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,930
going to going to be going to be a

310
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,670
parent and how do we create that same

311
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,520
level of commitment

312
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,370
I'm just hoping teams are not thinking

313
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:28,560
that they only need to talk during the

314
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:31,440
daily scrum yeah somebody a scrum master

315
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,090
or asked me the other day hey does it

316
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,790
feel that you like we have more meetings

317
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:40,770
now and I got thinking it does and it is

318
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,500
as I look at my calendar and I have a

319
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,930
number of quick 1520's

320
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,930
let's say discuss this technical problem

321
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,030
or discuss this plan or do this where

322
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,620
those conversations would have happened

323
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,800
organically in the off and a drive-by

324
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,510
you know like walking up to goal having

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,990
a what

326
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,860
if we had to go third-person we just now

327
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,910
you see I'm gonna schedule time to make

328
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:14,030
sure you're in the WebEx camera and able

329
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:17,030
to you know miss so it does feel like

330
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,580
there's more of a schedule nature to

331
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,530
work it's interesting though you talk

332
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,380
about like I think what I heard you

333
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,720
talking about was follow-up like

334
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,120
committing like delivery commitments to

335
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,190
each other a lot of times lately where I

336
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,660
have forgotten owed somebody something

337
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,310
pretty small because I just get

338
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:41,060
destroyed I don't I'm not as focused as

339
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,440
I was before in the office and I didn't

340
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,950
have all my tools and trappings

341
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,870
available to keep me focused on the work

342
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,260
at hand so I find it easier for little

343
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:56,150
things to slip through but and the flip

344
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,740
side of that is more attitude now and

345
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,060
I'm like yeah I think I can you know

346
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,660
give me two minutes I'm gonna run to the

347
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:05,840
to the kitchen fine I'll be right back

348
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:13,820
and I can do that you know at work me

349
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:18,710
being distracted Thanks yeah I I agree

350
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:23,930
and I think especially with everybody

351
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:26,810
off everybody are the schools being off

352
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,720
and people's kids being at home there

353
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:34,940
can't be the same expectation of

354
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,550
commitment from folks anyway yeah I

355
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:44,200
think it's going to be very difficult to

356
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:44,200
find to find that level of commitment

357
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,740
yeah do the metrics change at all or do

358
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,720
you think that the metrics that

359
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,000
leadership and the organization cares

360
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,760
about is gonna change if this persists

361
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,570
for months and months it depends if if

362
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,910
leadership are focused on yeah I'm gonna

363
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,010
use a bad phrase I don't like using it

364
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,830
the metrics they should be rather the

365
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,090
metrics they shouldn't then I don't

366
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,490
think the the shoot

367
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,679
change we should be looking at fart for

368
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,340
engineering teams or any teams building

369
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,559
some kind of product or some kind of

370
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,360
output then we should be looking at

371
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,880
value delivery are we getting the most

372
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,919
valuable thing it doesn't really matter

373
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,559
whether people spend 12 hours a day or

374
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,320
two hours a day if we're getting enough

375
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,020
value that we as an organization and our

376
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,159
customers are happy with the output that

377
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,200
we're getting then then or sorry the

378
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,679
output I used the wrong word again the

379
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,330
outcomes that we're getting then it's

380
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:55,799
irrelevant how much people actually work

381
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:58,559
right but I think and again I'm making

382
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,770
some leaps here is an organization that

383
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,590
has a really good track record of

384
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,840
measuring outcomes and value could

385
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,730
easily say hey we're getting the same or

386
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,470
greater value delivered than we used to

387
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,020
but think about a company or

388
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,330
organization who had what their value

389
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,880
was and they were only measuring output

390
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,909
in activities like hours billed or lines

391
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,299
of code written my fear is they are

392
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:27,210
going to over index even more so and

393
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,640
over focus on getting every drop of

394
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,679
orange juice out of that out of that

395
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,110
fruit and say I have to squeeze harder

396
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,970
and how to and say well hey you're

397
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,159
getting what you've always gotten you

398
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,120
know so you should be happy with you

399
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,520
know we have lower costs probably and

400
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,320
we're getting the same but just to say

401
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,110
that we have to know what the same was

402
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,240
yeah so a company that didn't do the

403
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,120
hard work early to figure out how to

404
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,340
measure and track value delivery doesn't

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,140
have a baseline

406
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,630
yeah I totally get that

407
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,850
and I think that it's gonna be very

408
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,980
difficult for those those companies to

409
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:10,169
figure out what what they're going to do

410
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:14,100
and I have I have a slight inkling that

411
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:19,649
those companies will just die I I've got

412
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,559
a feeling that and as they realize that

413
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:25,230
from their perspective they're not

414
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,770
getting their return on investment

415
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,929
because they

416
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,300
investment is based on quantity of work

417
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,890
not quality of work so they feel that

418
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,559
they are not getting the return on

419
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,559
investment they divest themselves of

420
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:42,870
employees in order to how many how many

421
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,880
employees in the last how many people

422
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,429
signed on in the that's British

423
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
expression what's it called when you

424
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,970
register for as unemployed in the US

425
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,940
there's a name for it I can remember the

426
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,580
USA's we called signing on here fire

427
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,640
file if I oh yeah I'll file for yeah

428
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,730
yeah um Ted over 10 million people have

429
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,210
filed in the last two weeks in the US

430
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,520
and it's it's not in as high a

431
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,390
percentage of that as that here in the

432
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,270
UK mainly because the government is

433
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:18,870
paying eighty percent of people's

434
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,460
salaries you know for companies to stay

435
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,210
in business and not not go out of

436
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,460
business but I think companies that are

437
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,670
focused solely on the bottom line solely

438
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,000
on profit so Leon's that squeezed

439
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,550
squeezing more juice out I think I think

440
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,090
they're gonna go they're gonna go bust

441
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:41,760
they're gonna they're gonna break yeah

442
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:45,570
and III I think there are exceptions but

443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:49,080
I think that's what will happen there's

444
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:53,820
two really interesting things I that I

445
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:58,290
see one is people are being extra

446
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:01,110
sensitive to expecting less like I see

447
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,330
people expecting less so it'll be

448
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:10,800
interesting to see if this how far this

449
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:13,200
goes if that correlates to people's take

450
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,000
on the workplace and measuring and

451
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,309
caring about the right things but the

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,820
other thing and completely different is

453
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,020
if I think about some of the really good

454
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,000
people that I work with over the years

455
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,559
and I'm like why are you still here you

456
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,790
know you seem to hate your job you don't

457
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,460
seem to like this company

458
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,900
no yeah but I'm comfortable you know

459
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,130
I've been coming to this building every

460
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,620
day for twelve years and I've been

461
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,720
working with the same people but imagine

462
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,970
if you take all of that comfort away and

463
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,549
everybody starts working remotely even

464
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,249
most

465
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:44,230
to the time well then changing your

466
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:47,350
employer is just as simple as changing

467
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,720
which VPN you log into and what your

468
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,220
email address is in your workplace the

469
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,200
people you interact with the building

470
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,159
your commute none of that matters so

471
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,590
what you might see is a higher

472
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,960
propensity for people to switch

473
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,369
employers to ones that value the right

474
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,629
things or seem to value them more

475
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:12,389
because it's the barrier to switches is

476
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:17,200
greatly diminish that time limit it's as

477
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:20,080
as people either switched to employers

478
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:27,369
who actually care rather than pretend to

479
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:30,580
care um or start their own businesses to

480
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:34,629
fill a gap in the market and care and

481
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:38,609
hire people who care maybe maybe this

482
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:43,269
could be a big push for the purely

483
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:48,429
capitalistic focused organizations who

484
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:54,460
are going to struggle if they're though

485
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:58,019
there was a big push and towards a lean

486
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:02,169
but in the wrong way

487
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:04,359
you know III ever I have a horrible

488
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,759
story about how lean was implemented

489
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,879
Lean Six Sigma if you're familiar with

490
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,289
the term Lean Six Sigma was implemented

491
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:15,999
in an organization that I worked with

492
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:18,220
and where the IT support department did

493
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:20,529
you know Six Sigma training they got a

494
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:24,519
six sigma consultant turn they spent

495
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:26,169
three months doing this figuring out

496
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,509
what they were going to do and then they

497
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:31,840
implemented it and what the implemented

498
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:33,639
was shadow masks on their workstations

499
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,559
where their coffee cup goes at the end

500
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,700
of the day where their keyboard goes at

501
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,549
the end of the day where their mouse

502
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,070
goes at the end of the day and my

503
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,859
question was yeah that see that face

504
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,109
you've got that's the exact face I had

505
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:49,359
when they were presenting presenting

506
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:52,210
their awesomeness that they'd managed to

507
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:58,080
do in this Six Sigma world

508
00:26:52,210 --> 00:27:03,100
and and for me they just completely

509
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,650
missed the point they missed the point

510
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,530
so they were they were focusing on you

511
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:12,240
know that that part of lean where you

512
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:16,600
would maybe optimize your workspace and

513
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,750
because maybe the consultant came out of

514
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,310
a manufacturing world and they're

515
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,230
talking around it in a manufacturing

516
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,530
world it was in fact a manufacturing

517
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,290
company so it there's a little bit of

518
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:32,980
synergy there that would be that that

519
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:37,120
level of expertise and but somebody on

520
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:43,120
in IT the physical world is not their

521
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:46,090
world and my first question was can I

522
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,850
find files on the file server quicker no

523
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,880
that can I create a support ticket

524
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:56,290
quicker can I find out what's going on

525
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,800
quicker and I think that missing missing

526
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:02,020
the point is happening quite a lot in

527
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,130
our industry it's why people talk about

528
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,590
all agile is dead or scrum is dead it's

529
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,030
not that it's dead people have just used

530
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,110
the terms and features incorrectly I

531
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,360
know that's I'm trying not to be

532
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,580
religious about it it's it's it might

533
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,830
work just fine but they're they've

534
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:25,870
they've messed with the name or

535
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,000
implemented it in a way that doesn't

536
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,430
necessarily provide them with the value

537
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,950
that they were looking for and then they

538
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:35,290
complain that the thing doesn't work

539
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,900
when in fact it's the implementation

540
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:41,860
that doesn't work and then backing off

541
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:44,880
and not inspecting and adapting is the

542
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:53,980
complete untag Anette antagonistic

543
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:56,350
opposite of agility yeah yeah that's a

544
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,520
lot to impact but something tells me

545
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:03,150
that that company read or attended some

546
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,120
work by Poul acres with two second lean

547
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,270
which is a great room

548
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,809
box is a great YouTube channel and a

549
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:16,220
great company and a lot of those little

550
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:19,820
kind of workspace hacks come from his

551
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,190
world what end to second lien is what

552
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,200
can you do in your day to save two

553
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,820
seconds like how can you optimize you

554
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,800
them so if you create two little Mark's

555
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,330
in your lunchroom and this is where the

556
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,370
salt shaker goes and this is where the

557
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,860
pepper shaker goes that might save two

558
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,150
seconds but then when we encourage

559
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
people to say how can you say two

560
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,140
seconds they end up saying well I found

561
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,730
this thing that can save 30 minutes or I

562
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,090
found this thing that can save five

563
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:48,200
hours so it's really about getting

564
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:52,309
people thinking about waste and seeing

565
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:56,600
the value in the 5s is one of which is

566
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:59,150
you know sorting and standardize this

567
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,240
works there's value in that as far as

568
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,610
building habits I think some of the

569
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,309
philosophy is if we help people get good

570
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:10,700
at organizing and see organizing as a

571
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:14,120
way to reduce waste they will figure out

572
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,670
how to store files on a file server more

573
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,220
efficiently yep but I think so many

574
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:23,179
times people stop at the easy stuff and

575
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:25,040
they don't do the hard work to say okay

576
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:28,400
great you figured out where my keyboard

577
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,760
could set on my desk but what are we

578
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,620
doing about that big giant problem in

579
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,200
you know the IT world or that big

580
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:39,410
database problem that we have over there

581
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,980
and it's making that leap from the

582
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:47,690
mindset of agility to the hard work and

583
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,670
practice of agility I agree and that's

584
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,400
the the thing that I see time and again

585
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,370
in organizations and it doesn't matter

586
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,830
whether you call it lean whether you

587
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,920
call it a jewel or scrum or Kanban or

588
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:08,330
DevOps it doesn't matter what you call

589
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:12,890
it the same fundamental goal is there

590
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:14,840
and is often often missed no I know you

591
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,440
don't come from our DevOps background

592
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,040
you're correct

593
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:25,310
yeah well yes and now my background

594
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:28,400
before I got into the world of advil was

595
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:32,060
all infrastructure so client-server

596
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,340
cloud network all that so I touch with

597
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,250
DevOps a little bit so I have a systems

598
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,700
background not a development background

599
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,710
but I'd say more kind of my background

600
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,950
was always in building high-performing

601
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,890
teams and knowing that my special power

602
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:51,920
- skill wasn't in always doing the work

603
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,750
but it was motivating inspiring and

604
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,260
helping others do their best work and

605
00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:01,310
that's kind of the world I live in the

606
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:05,060
most cool so what what what does it be

607
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:08,780
you're working on just I'm so right now

608
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:11,810
I'm an agile coach and scrum master and

609
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:15,680
trainer for insight so I do a lot of

610
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:17,720
different things but I am primarily a

611
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,420
working scrum master an agile coach on a

612
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,310
product line at a large company here in

613
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,840
the United States so I'm working with

614
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,840
development teams and other scrum

615
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,170
masters who get really really important

616
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,430
work done tech very technical work and

617
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:36,710
it's really stretched my skills it's

618
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,110
taught me a lot that this engagement has

619
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,000
taught me a lot about myself about what

620
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:45,230
I'm good at what I'm not good at it and

621
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,950
how it's really helped me figure out how

622
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:54,190
to help build high-performing teams have

623
00:32:48,950 --> 00:33:00,170
you run any of the scrum to dark classes

624
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:03,860
remotely yet so I am leading our very

625
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:07,360
first one in the company in April we're

626
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:13,340
gonna do a PSM live virtual it is April

627
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:15,710
vapor later this month the the tic-tock

628
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,660
tic-tock trust me I feel a little bit of

629
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,390
stress and anxiety there but I'm very

630
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:25,190
excited to though and then I'm going to

631
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:29,390
be copilot on more than likely on the

632
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,260
PSF live virtual and a poly I might be

633
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,220
leading a poly

634
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,050
live virtual

635
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:39,940
so I I have a pally in two weeks so I'm

636
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:46,040
doing a poly in the Edinburgh timezone

637
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:51,020
yeah public poly I have to to normal

638
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,160
people and one PST coming so normally I

639
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,910
don't know how difficult that will be

640
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:00,010
for my first live virtual classroom

641
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:06,590
escapade so it's going to be interesting

642
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:13,280
I attended a workshop last week and was

643
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:17,540
Todd's workshop and and he did it was me

644
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,510
as a PST and a bunch of normal people we

645
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:23,300
were from his some of his classes who

646
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,670
were just exploring things and they went

647
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,380
through a workshop so some good

648
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,540
learnings there in figuring out not only

649
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,110
how to run the workshop but how to

650
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,520
maintain the engagement levels that was

651
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,600
that was really good I really enjoyed

652
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,720
that but I've got the I'm jumping in

653
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:47,810
I've literally got I've got next week

654
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:50,900
free and then I jump into Polly Monday

655
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,660
Tuesday then the next Monday Tuesday PSF

656
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:57,530
next Monday Tuesday PSF next Monday

657
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:59,690
choose the PSM so it's gonna be a little

658
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:03,050
bit full-on at least I don't have them

659
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:06,860
all in the same week luckily the to

660
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:14,540
private PSFS that I'm doing and luckily

661
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:16,550
the customer said um you know we we want

662
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,830
to do we want to do it private which is

663
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:22,250
good and we want to do it Monday

664
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:26,060
Tuesday's because they have deployments

665
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:28,370
on a Saturday there there that's quite

666
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,580
every Saturday so they want they wanted

667
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,170
to front-load the week rather than back

668
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,550
load the week so that that helped me out

669
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,380
a little bit as well it meant they

670
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,200
didn't want to in the same week which

671
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:42,590
was a good idea yeah give me some time

672
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,720
to prep in between and optimize things a

673
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,000
little bit

674
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,589
but yeah I'm looking forward to that as

675
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,079
well you'll have to fill me in after

676
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:57,319
after the first one because we're

677
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,800
experimenting with for half-day sessions

678
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,140
go guys I just feel like it's gonna be

679
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,329
exhausting for both the instructors and

680
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,250
the students to do phase and and I have

681
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:10,910
never been successful in keeping

682
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:15,200
someone's attention electronically for

683
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:17,599
more than three to four hours yep but I

684
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,069
also know that there's pros and cons to

685
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,680
that approach the other thing I'm

686
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:23,930
curious are you gonna have a facilitator

687
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,410
or somebody who's supporting you from a

688
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:31,250
logistic standpoint so you can focus on

689
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:33,140
teaching so right now no I don't have

690
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,680
anybody who's gonna be helping me out so

691
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm gonna be doing it all which is where

692
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,609
I'm thinking about the tools that I'm

693
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:46,700
going to use obviously well obviously

694
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:51,020
obviously for us maybe but that mural

695
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,839
has been seems to be a useful useful -

696
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,329
yeah I had in the workshop last week it

697
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,190
worked really well I've seen bits and

698
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:59,720
pieces over before and I think everybody

699
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,569
all the other trainers have been using

700
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,310
it to facilitate their workshops so much

701
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:06,290
so that I thinks Kramden are going to be

702
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,089
bringing out some templates

703
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:14,540
I think there's already templates

704
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:17,150
available for the PSM PSM and PSN - I

705
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,220
believe have templates so I think that

706
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,560
that will that will help a lot even if

707
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,390
it's just giving everybody a jump start

708
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,050
and then some stuffs pre-prepared and we

709
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:30,890
can just implement those templates but

710
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:33,890
also the the the the the video

711
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:36,560
conferencing tool and they were going to

712
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:41,569
be using I think is important as well I

713
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,160
had planned to use zoom and the reason I

714
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:45,950
plan to use zoom is it's good breakout

715
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,040
rooms but the museum has some

716
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:53,869
significant issues right now not

717
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,609
everybody's happy using zoom based on

718
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:58,430
the security concerns that have come out

719
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,580
in the last little while well it's all

720
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,500
we

721
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,500
the case once when you're when you're a

722
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,030
little player nobody cares and you

723
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,550
become a big player and everybody

724
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:12,970
everybody cares and I think the the yeah

725
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:17,450
I'm not particularly bothered about

726
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:20,810
leakage personally if that makes sense

727
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:23,960
like if if some part of my video goes

728
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:27,230
out and people get a hold of it CAA okay

729
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,440
whatever that's that's okay but I think

730
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:34,820
it's more the concern of students in the

731
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:39,140
class so I'm definitely running the PSFS

732
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:40,880
in Microsoft teams which is secure or at

733
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,540
least doesn't have any known biggest

734
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,410
holes in it but it does then require

735
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:51,440
everybody to authenticate um but also

736
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:54,250
that's the thing that makes it more

737
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,690
difficult to set up and manage initially

738
00:38:54,250 --> 00:39:00,620
but it is the thing that negates the

739
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:05,210
problem that people have with the that

740
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:08,300
you can just jump in yeah you know we're

741
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,160
doing a lot of tool reviews as well and

742
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,610
it's funny because right is this thing

743
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,140
hit I had done a presentation around the

744
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:22,010
relationship of tools with agility and

745
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,450
it was very you know there is a certain

746
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,730
amount of premonition there because I

747
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,040
said tools do not make you agile but

748
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:32,200
they can absolutely enhance your daily

749
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:35,420
and getting good at tools and the

750
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,150
application of tools will should be

751
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,880
something you focus on in value but then

752
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,770
even even more interesting I think and

753
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,890
I'm curious if you agree with this as as

754
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:48,290
we go as we develop more and more mature

755
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,870
skills our tooling has to change so I

756
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,700
thought back to there's two analogies I

757
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:56,060
use one is when I just started a golf

758
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,890
when I was a kid my I just used a pair

759
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,800
of hand-me-down golf clubs and they were

760
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,780
okay and but then when my skills got to

761
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,570
a certain point the tools became a

762
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,400
limiting factor so then I went and I

763
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,360
bought a nice set of off-the-shelf golf

764
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,890
yelps and my game progressed and then

765
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,900
some point I needed custom lights

766
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,930
because I was growing I was a teenager

767
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,820
and so our tools had to evolve with our

768
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,940
skill set and then also I'm kind of an

769
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,460
amateur woodworker and if you walk into

770
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,400
a master woodworkers shop who's been

771
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,440
doing it for 10,000 hours or more they

772
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,230
might have a single hand plane that's a

773
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,980
$300 hand plane that serves one very

774
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:40,100
special purpose that they pull out twice

775
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,250
a year but it is the perfect tool to

776
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,620
deliver a very high quality product and

777
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,760
there's no there's no better replacement

778
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,040
tool but then there's a certain amount

779
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,500
of vanity in that tool and you could say

780
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,720
well could you get the same outcome with

781
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,360
a cheap tool from one of the big-box

782
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,510
retailers and you might be able to but I

783
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,260
just find it so funny with lately the

784
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,720
focus on tools in the last few weeks not

785
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,410
funny is in you know negative but just

786
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:13,070
interesting in how tooling is becoming

787
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:15,340
an amplifier for agility I agree and I'm

788
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,230
gonna have to turn this light on because

789
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,850
this light just automatically went off

790
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:36,710
because nobody walked around for 20

791
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:38,720
minutes so give me one sec sure there we

792
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,360
go that feels a little better I can

793
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,300
actually everybody can see me now as

794
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,750
well and I can see yeah yeah and see

795
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,660
what I have

796
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:54,710
i I've set up a studio in here so I have

797
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,880
a camcorder linked in to do the

798
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,580
whiteboard so if I need to draw

799
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,030
something on the whiteboard when I'm

800
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:07,130
doing calls and stuff I have to light

801
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:09,140
boxes up here cuz lights important

802
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:14,960
especially on video I think it's

803
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:19,310
difficult to see what's going on yeah no

804
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,320
I agree I my my wife thought I was crazy

805
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,569
about a year ago when I made sure that

806
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,949
all the light bulbs that I bought in my

807
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:27,640
home office for the same temperature

808
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:29,539
which is not where I am right now but

809
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,029
because I didn't want to have color

810
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:34,130
correction issues you can have all that

811
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:35,479
stuff so I had a pretty obsessive around

812
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,449
the lighting and make sure I got all the

813
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:41,209
same brand all the same temperature so

814
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:43,190
that I I had a better quality lighting

815
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:46,400
setup yeah and I've been I've been

816
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:49,849
playing around with it like last week I

817
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,729
had Daniel Vacanti on to have a

818
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:58,549
discussion and we had air core problems

819
00:42:52,729 --> 00:43:00,289
from Daniel because I wasn't now I've

820
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:02,569
got headphones inspect and adapt you

821
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,940
just got to figure it out this is new to

822
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:08,839
me as well I've been learning how to use

823
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:11,390
new tools like will be s studio for

824
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:13,190
streaming and setting up the different

825
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,519
thing that I can even do like if we have

826
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,519
a problem

827
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:25,190
we can go on please stand by while I go

828
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:28,010
fix something or whatever yeah it's been

829
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:34,910
it's been fun and how to how to get

830
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:39,470
scape which you're on into here that was

831
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:42,530
craziness there's lots of bender lbs so

832
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:46,040
Skype is the only video conferencing

833
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:52,819
tool that I found that has a special

834
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:57,910
feature called NDI a so Skype is

835
00:43:52,819 --> 00:44:03,170
actually if I go to my desktop picture

836
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:06,589
I'm in the middle and you can see you're

837
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,960
on skype there that's my two skype

838
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:12,980
windows so that lack of focus one and

839
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:20,030
the this one and but that's not what's

840
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:25,069
happening and in here okay so Skype is

841
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:28,190
dreaming all of the different feed video

842
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:31,640
feeds that it's got locally so that

843
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:35,599
means that I'm hooking in to this n di

844
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,700
stream and putting your display here but

845
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,069
I can if two or three people were

846
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:44,569
calling in and I can bring them all in

847
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:46,250
and move them around and it was very

848
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:48,710
complicated to set up I'm quite happy

849
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:55,250
that I managed to get it I think it was

850
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:58,849
complicated for me maybe I don't know it

851
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,740
was it's it's been a lot of work trying

852
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:03,109
to figure out these things get it get it

853
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,119
good and I think it's a is it's part of

854
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:09,040
the fun it's something else to focus on

855
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:12,770
and that's the thing that I found in our

856
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,140
what do you call it whoa you new world

857
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:19,130
while I'm working you we have work here

858
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:22,490
and isn't it n well new way of working

859
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:28,010
okay yeah there we go you know in our

860
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:31,130
new way of working all of all of all of

861
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:33,620
the work and conferences that I had

862
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:35,660
just disappeared not quite overnight

863
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,830
over there over the period of a week or

864
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:42,770
so so then we had to reevaluate and

865
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,340
figure out what to do and the I think

866
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:50,300
the stream for where we that are would

867
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:52,610
you call it funnel for where we get work

868
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:57,050
in the new model is substantially

869
00:45:52,610 --> 00:46:00,010
different it's it's maybe different

870
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,420
people who would see and come to online

871
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,400
training then would come to in-person

872
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,200
training although there's probably a lot

873
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,090
of overlap as well but there are some

874
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,660
people who just I don't care if it's not

875
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:13,660
in person

876
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:16,310
um and I think doing doing these

877
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,550
recording videos getting content out

878
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:21,350
there and there is in this format that

879
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:24,530
people would use if they were coming to

880
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:27,680
engage with you and I think is is part

881
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:31,240
of that that new model we are we're

882
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,680
inspecting and adapting already yeah

883
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,740
well one thing I've been thinking about

884
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,470
is how does this change the training

885
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,900
landscape because think about if you're

886
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,520
a remote learner and you're in Omaha

887
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,330
Nebraska here in the United States in

888
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,850
the Midwest and you don't have any local

889
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:53,000
you know quote-unquote experts or very

890
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,380
few so you're looking at well where am I

891
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,090
going to travel to and it's like now you

892
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,180
don't have trouble anywhere you can go

893
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:01,940
get trained and come on by Daniel come

894
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,760
to you you could go get trained in Azure

895
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,310
DevOps from our natural would I mean so

896
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,880
you you now have are a worldwide

897
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:13,580
consumer and I feel that the trainer

898
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,220
expertise and the quality of the

899
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,110
training becomes paramount now because

900
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:23,990
we've minimized and eliminated the

901
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:26,600
barriers to immediacy and location you

902
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:28,850
know so to me that's provided to me it's

903
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:34,220
great because I think I put on a very

904
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:37,670
good high quality learning session but I

905
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,530
think that you know for many and I'm not

906
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:42,080
saying I'm like somehow I'm elite

907
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,410
trainer because trust me I'm not but I

908
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,539
like to think that there

909
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,539
or like I want that class because that's

910
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:50,920
a gym class instead of well that's just

911
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,869
that I'm just going to gym class because

912
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,990
he happens to be in the same city or

913
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:58,960
state that I'm in which that'll always

914
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:01,779
be a part of it but I want to build a

915
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,210
reputation for my classes being of such

916
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:07,059
a high quality that they're sobbed out

917
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,950
and I think I think that that's actually

918
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:12,630
one of the problems that I've been

919
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:16,799
having and doing classes in Scotland and

920
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:19,720
and that's that I am much more known

921
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:23,619
outside of Scotland than inside of

922
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:27,089
Scotland having you know I I worked for

923
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:30,460
three years from 2010 to 2013 in Seattle

924
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:32,349
doing DevOps and agile consulting across

925
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,230
I don't know I think I did sixty

926
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:39,130
different states which is quite a lot

927
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:41,769
and many of my customers were in San

928
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,559
Diego in the surrounding area and as

929
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:49,150
eight hour time difference from here and

930
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:52,720
I do a lot of training in in Oslo so in

931
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:56,019
in the in the UK I up until recently

932
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,630
have never really gotten much work

933
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:01,960
mainly cuz folks that just didn't know I

934
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:04,210
was here didn't didn't see my content

935
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,210
didn't didn't loop in that circle I

936
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:11,019
guess but and it's interesting because

937
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:14,259
one of the other PS T's in the UK had

938
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:21,970
been training over in Edinburgh as well

939
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:25,930
and um it's it's when people come to my

940
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:28,809
class many of the people that come to my

941
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:31,059
class were flying in come to my class I

942
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,990
got very few people who were were Eddie

943
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:35,740
robeast

944
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:38,650
well maybe very few probably one of one

945
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:42,250
of those Scottish phrases for you know

946
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,319
about half and about half of the people

947
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:48,329
that were coming to my class were flying

948
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:51,099
in and I think that's that's just due to

949
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:54,849
me going to other places around the

950
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:56,079
world and doing conferences they are

951
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:57,910
like I didn't do a lot of conferences in

952
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,369
the UK I did conferences in the you

953
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:04,930
in Europe my customers were US and

954
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:08,260
Europe check n yeah but now with

955
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:11,140
Bertrand you should care

956
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,990
so the the poly that I'm doing in a

957
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:18,010
couple of weeks I just had to two folks

958
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:21,670
from Germany sign up and I did a poly in

959
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:24,849
Germany in fact I did a poly in Germany

960
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:27,789
the weekend before they closed that hole

961
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:31,869
of lights so luckily it wasn't later

962
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:33,460
than that and I think that um you know

963
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:35,049
there were people who maybe wanted to

964
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:39,280
come that couldn't so then they booked

965
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:42,280
into the Edinburgh one yeah that's good

966
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,819
hey you just said something that I have

967
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:49,960
to ask about you said folks folks I

968
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:51,700
struggle yes as a trainer I get my hand

969
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,180
slapped occasionally and I do it to

970
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:58,619
myself for six you guys I use you guys

971
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:03,640
it's just a collective it's the group is

972
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:05,230
folks your preferred nomenclature for so

973
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:09,160
last that long

974
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:11,770
no to be honest guys is my preferred

975
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:15,309
Norma culture that's what I default to

976
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:17,410
that's what I I me nights three years of

977
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:24,839
training consulting around the us guys

978
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:29,039
is they go to and just like it

979
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:34,569
interesting act I prefer to focus on

980
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:40,690
intent then on the actual works so when

981
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:44,740
I say guys I'm being all inclusive but I

982
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:47,260
am being very conscious of that and I've

983
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:51,220
switched to folks but it is very I'm

984
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:54,510
getting better at folks and telling guys

985
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:57,609
but I'm doing folks or everyone or

986
00:51:54,510 --> 00:52:00,279
something else just to be to be more

987
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:01,960
conscious of it because I think while it

988
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:03,640
doesn't matter to some people it does

989
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,650
matter to others so I think it's an

990
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:10,720
important thing to take note off and but

991
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,770
it's just like I are we the one that

992
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,420
always got me were

993
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:21,520
and people saying oh shoot or dagnabbit

994
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:24,670
or I don't know some curse words

995
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,580
although we would say swear word in the

996
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,070
UK but some curse word and that they've

997
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:35,830
made up in order to not say a real curse

998
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:38,350
word yeah and from my perspective the

999
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:42,790
intent is still there if I stub my toe

1000
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:45,700
and say die ignite I'm still swearing

1001
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:47,980
because that was my intent even though I

1002
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:51,130
used words that aren't normal swear

1003
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:58,780
words and so I read for me it's the same

1004
00:52:51,130 --> 00:53:02,350
with guys and folks if I say folks but I

1005
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:04,360
mean guys then I'm being disingenuous

1006
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:06,430
and that's the bit you should get

1007
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:10,900
slapped down for but if I say guys and

1008
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:12,340
mean mean folks then III wouldn't like

1009
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,760
to get slapped down for that but yeah

1010
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,230
you know words words matter and if

1011
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,780
you've read the scrum guide yeah well no

1012
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:24,070
words matter or it matter a lot I think

1013
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:28,060
it's definitely something I've tried to

1014
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:30,190
focus on yeah I have to

1015
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,260
my grandmother famously has a

1016
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,750
replacement word for every swear word

1017
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,910
and I'm like why do you do that we I

1018
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:40,600
know what you mean it's just like what

1019
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:41,740
you said so I'm curious because there

1020
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,600
might be somebody out there who says

1021
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,670
wait what the heck word Jim and Martin's

1022
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,890
supposed to be talking about today did

1023
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:50,350
did you what were we supposed to be

1024
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:54,910
talking about he said it is riffing on

1025
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:56,920
the list and I had fashioned ilysm and I

1026
00:53:54,910 --> 00:54:00,400
had conflicting priorities that were the

1027
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,630
two things that are analysts and we we

1028
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,359
should spend about 20 minutes talking

1029
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,480
about professionalism and then we

1030
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:11,640
tangent T how many minutes I'm

1031
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:14,080
unprofessional and my two priorities are

1032
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:17,350
chocolate and puzzles and board games

1033
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:20,109
lit so that's three well Jess can I did

1034
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,720
a puzzle a thousand-piece puzzle that

1035
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:26,079
was kind of fun and we collaborated on

1036
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:29,529
that and we've been playing some board

1037
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,269
I have a I have a group um the the meets

1038
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:35,859
on Sunday and we've been meeting on

1039
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:40,329
discord and I played games for nine

1040
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:42,880
hours on Sunday that's awesome yeah I've

1041
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:45,609
been aware of discord for years but I

1042
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,440
would tell you that for years I was

1043
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:50,109
probably one of a hundred people in my

1044
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,819
circle that knew about it and now I have

1045
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:52,960
people like have you checked out on a

1046
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:55,690
discord channel have you checked your

1047
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,539
channel and it's like it overnight it

1048
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:02,470
went mainstream it seems like I've got

1049
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:04,720
like twenty discord channels that I'm a

1050
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:09,130
member of knows yeah getting ridiculous

1051
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,589
it's almost getting overwhelming so I do

1052
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,710
have a couple thoughts about

1053
00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:16,839
professionalism and competing priorities

1054
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:19,990
the interesting thing about priorities

1055
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:22,210
and I'm curious what you think is there

1056
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:25,059
is no such thing as the plural of

1057
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:29,140
priorities he you only can have one

1058
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:30,759
priority and I this is now went into my

1059
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,440
teaching especially around product

1060
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:35,470
ownership is you know what is your

1061
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:39,910
priority oh I have five priorities no

1062
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:44,319
you have one and you know anyone who has

1063
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:48,069
ever why I have two priorities you know

1064
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:51,640
I want to go to the gym and and workout

1065
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:54,130
tonight and I also want to go binge that

1066
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,839
new show on Netflix well whichever one

1067
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:59,289
you do first that's what you prioritize

1068
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:02,230
you might do both things but whichever

1069
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:04,839
one you did first is actually what you

1070
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:06,309
prioritize okay so this is an

1071
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:10,779
interesting one because I bring it up in

1072
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:13,480
my classes quite a lot okay and I have

1073
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:16,269
the same feeling as you however the

1074
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:20,170
majority of the time when I'm teaching

1075
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:24,970
scrum classes I'm teaching non-native

1076
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:29,680
English speakers and in most that I've

1077
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:34,559
found so far other languages it is

1078
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:38,500
plural it just means a dirt bike

1079
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,310
priorities just means ordered for for

1080
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,810
them so

1081
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:47,530
you know I sometimes I have a it's

1082
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:49,470
interesting for me the things that are

1083
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:54,970
different across those cultures and

1084
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:57,310
languages yeah yeah I I think firm it

1085
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,630
and that's how I use it in my in my

1086
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,730
teaching is the difference between

1087
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,890
priority and order and I say we might do

1088
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:04,960
things in a specific order that is out a

1089
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:07,600
priority so in that example I might go

1090
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,950
to the gym first and then go home and

1091
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,180
watch Netflix because that's the most

1092
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,250
logical order

1093
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,280
maybe the gym is on my way home from the

1094
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:18,100
office and it would be dumb of me to go

1095
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,200
home watch a television show and then

1096
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,440
drive back to the gym that that might be

1097
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,750
dumb it's a good thought exercise to

1098
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,810
understand the difference between

1099
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:30,340
priority and order and how those things

1100
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:33,370
relate especially when we're like

1101
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:36,460
delivering value and building features I

1102
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:39,400
mean and again I hate to come back to

1103
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,730
zoom but if did you know and I guess

1104
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,290
this is not fact but this is opinion but

1105
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:46,630
the opinion I've heard is that zooms

1106
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:48,880
number one delight er from a feature

1107
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,160
perspective was their virtual

1108
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,590
backgrounds that the the number one

1109
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:56,620
thing that customers really touted as

1110
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,870
why they choose yeah your average person

1111
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,970
the number one reason that the the

1112
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:03,250
feature they loved in the zoom platform

1113
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,760
was the fun virtual backgrounds so guess

1114
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,870
what you see every other company

1115
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,430
prioritizing now they're they're pushing

1116
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,240
out virtual backgrounds and virtual

1117
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,610
green screens

1118
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,370
it wasn't the stability or security the

1119
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:17,920
platform yeah obviously it wasn't the

1120
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:21,310
breakout rooms you know your average

1121
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,140
just you know a user didn't care about

1122
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:27,520
recovery rooms now we as trainers did

1123
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:29,550
yeah we care about the rooms yeah but

1124
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,290
but think about it if you look at a

1125
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:36,070
prioritization model of like des

1126
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,050
lighters and parity and which which

1127
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:42,510
features a user cares about sometimes

1128
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:42,510
it's surprising I totally agree in its

1129
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:49,920
it's the struggle of a product owner to

1130
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,080
make a decision between

1131
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:59,160
[Music]

1132
00:58:51,080 --> 00:59:00,810
Ling and long-term sustainable value and

1133
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,690
sometimes you might have to prioritize

1134
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:06,900
the bling because you know we need to

1135
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:09,360
compete with em other platforms and if

1136
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,120
that's what users value then we have to

1137
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:18,570
deliver what users value and but we also

1138
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:21,210
have to look at not spending all of our

1139
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:26,370
time just delivering things that users

1140
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:29,480
value otherwise I so I've got I got a

1141
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:31,440
just a little story around that the and

1142
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,020
you've probably heard me - you've

1143
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,930
probably heard me tell before and but

1144
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,990
it's the the azure DevOps team at

1145
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:43,350
Microsoft ten years ago were

1146
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:46,680
significantly behind the curve and

1147
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:49,590
behind the curve is an expression that I

1148
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,420
think M actually makes a lot makes a lot

1149
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,340
of sense it's one of those odd ones that

1150
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:56,820
actually makes a lot of sense because

1151
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:59,850
they they were building features at for

1152
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:02,400
users which means users were asking them

1153
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:04,080
for stuff and then they were building it

1154
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,810
in next release it just so happened that

1155
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,520
they had the two-year lag time so that

1156
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:10,560
really ends up being a four year lag

1157
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,570
time and in the enterprise world that

1158
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,090
was fine cuz Enterprise didn't really

1159
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:16,380
give a crap yeah for year like okay

1160
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,590
whatever that same is all of our

1161
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,830
software we can adopt things that

1162
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:25,470
quickly I get a customer that took

1163
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:27,630
nearly four years to move from server

1164
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:33,840
based source control to distribute or

1165
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:39,450
controller but and that that am unable

1166
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:42,390
to deliver quickly and building stuff

1167
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,470
for users that were that they were

1168
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:46,320
asking for it

1169
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:50,550
meant that you're a follower you were

1170
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:52,620
following what people want to do and one

1171
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:55,710
of the things that the the phoned was

1172
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:59,130
that they had the ended up building up

1173
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:01,350
too much technical debt because they

1174
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:03,120
were purely following leading because

1175
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,369
technical debt doesn't matter if you're

1176
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,320
a follower

1177
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:08,460
it really doesn't matter yeah and if

1178
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,839
you're making a lot of money off

1179
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,780
following you can just build up

1180
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:16,290
technical debt and we'll just whatever

1181
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:20,250
but the they spend concerted effort they

1182
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:21,630
their goal of their their product unit

1183
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,810
manager which was Brian Harry at the

1184
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:26,970
time was to get ahead of the curve how

1185
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:31,349
we need to build stuff for the early

1186
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:34,079
adopters so that by the time the

1187
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:36,540
majority of people come along we already

1188
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,730
have that feature in the product we are

1189
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:43,320
the ones leading the industry not

1190
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:50,160
following and they invested a lifetime

1191
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:51,540
in working and I yeah okay can I react

1192
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,630
to that a little bit because you just

1193
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:57,210
you're touching on is that that are just

1194
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:59,400
hitting home for me I left the company

1195
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,859
that I had that I was out for a number

1196
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,930
of years because they refused to try and

1197
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:06,480
get ahead of the curve that I used to

1198
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:09,000
joke that their product backlog was to

1199
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,890
send me links to our competitors

1200
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,740
websites and say we want what they have

1201
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:15,720
i it just rocked me to my core just

1202
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,910
bothered me that that is what they

1203
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,400
considered innovation was well this is

1204
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:22,319
what our competitors are succeeding with

1205
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,940
yep so that's what we need to build and

1206
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:26,880
I'm like yeah they have that idea a year

1207
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:29,339
and a half ago it's gonna take us a year

1208
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,859
to do it and then in a year-and-a-half

1209
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:35,130
they'll be that far to be onto something

1210
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:36,420
else yeah and I hate it when my the

1211
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:40,369
owners my company would go to

1212
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:42,750
conferences because I knew I hated it I

1213
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:45,270
look at their counter I'm like oh my god

1214
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:47,069
they're going to Vegas I can't wait to

1215
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:49,560
see what's gonna happen in my backlog of

1216
01:02:47,069 --> 01:02:51,869
work when they get back sure enough come

1217
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:55,400
back from Vegas I get a calendar invite

1218
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:57,319
that says highly important

1219
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,099
and they'd be like okay this is what we

1220
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:59,240
just heard about this is what

1221
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:00,680
everybody's doing this what we have to

1222
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,339
do I'm like I've known about that I've

1223
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:07,549
been other people in telling you and for

1224
01:03:04,339 --> 01:03:09,740
a year ago and you know so that's one

1225
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:13,250
reaction as I lived that nightmare for

1226
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:15,049
six years and then Nigel Thoreau I think

1227
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:18,970
just wrote an article one of our fellow

1228
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:22,490
PS T's in a very amazing thought leader

1229
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:25,279
about you know disruptive innovators and

1230
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,500
innovators and these different companies

1231
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:29,000
you know that sometimes can find

1232
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:34,640
themselves with different products or

1233
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:37,910
services and different quadrants so some

1234
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,740
of their some of their work is is even

1235
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:44,660
truly innovative other work is achieving

1236
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:46,819
parity with competition and then and

1237
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:49,190
again I'm sure I'm preaching to the

1238
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:53,750
choir here but you know in my training I

1239
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:56,329
talk a lot about features and features

1240
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:58,849
that became that went from the lighters

1241
01:03:56,329 --> 01:04:00,589
to now just maintaining the status quo

1242
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:03,349
like would anybody butter an automobile

1243
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:05,539
without a backup camera no the

1244
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:07,940
interesting thing about features is as

1245
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:09,710
soon as you build one in and it becomes

1246
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,260
ubiquitous meaning it's it's everywhere

1247
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:13,849
and just becomes you know a part of the

1248
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,970
standard package you can never take it

1249
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:19,369
away it's very very hard to take it away

1250
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:21,289
but it's you have to be very careful

1251
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,670
with what you build because every

1252
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:24,680
feature you build is a feature you have

1253
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:27,200
to maintain and extend and worry about

1254
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:31,670
from a stability and security standpoint

1255
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:33,440
and you know there's a quote out there

1256
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:37,130
and I forget who to attribute it to but

1257
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,440
he said that a product is not done when

1258
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:41,869
you can't Jam one more feature into it a

1259
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,760
product is done when you can't take

1260
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:46,819
anything away from it and still have it

1261
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:50,599
be desired and wanted by customers yeah

1262
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:55,220
and I love that idea and because that's

1263
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:58,940
agile principle number 10 simplicity you

1264
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:02,510
know so I I talked about and especially

1265
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:05,599
my in my training on both sides both the

1266
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:09,110
product owner site and on the the

1267
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:11,750
product side lean inventory control

1268
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:15,440
you want to have as few things in your

1269
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:18,890
backlog as possible but it still be a

1270
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,570
backlog I know you want as few things in

1271
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:25,250
your product as possible and it still be

1272
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:27,020
a product yeah so they and I'm in your

1273
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,580
school of thought on this but there is

1274
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,700
how we're kind of on topic cuz we're

1275
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:33,050
talking about competing priorities

1276
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,900
there's another coach in the same

1277
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:37,640
organization I'm in that feels that the

1278
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,220
product owners backlog should be as big

1279
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,050
as possible yeah like her dream back or

1280
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:45,620
a thousand items oh that's a small

1281
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:48,130
backlog and I'm like no no absolutely

1282
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:51,820
not how did you have folks how can you

1283
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:56,210
rationalize and prioritize an order

1284
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:58,040
4,000 items and even 400 like I don't

1285
01:05:56,210 --> 01:06:00,020
know if it's if there's not a perfect

1286
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,610
number but something tells me it's not

1287
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,760
you know what I thought of right there

1288
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:07,400
when you said how do I manage 4,000

1289
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:10,850
items same way you manage 4,000 people

1290
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,760
hierarchy need more higher alright you

1291
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:16,790
need more layers you need more more

1292
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,850
distance between the ideas and the

1293
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:24,140
realities for everybody else I'm being

1294
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:26,390
so cut out right now there is an idea of

1295
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:28,520
a funnel like let's dump as many things

1296
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:32,420
into that funnel as possible so let's

1297
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:34,700
consider many things but to me the most

1298
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,750
important thing a product owner can do

1299
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,370
is take something new look at it

1300
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:42,260
rationalize it and then say no we're not

1301
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:44,360
going to do that but if you just say

1302
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:46,130
well I'm gonna we might do that someday

1303
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:51,290
and I'm gonna put it in the corner over

1304
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:55,520
there you you just enhanced your anxiety

1305
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:57,890
around stuff yep you have a packrat

1306
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,440
mentality a hoarder mentality so I

1307
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,610
preach a more minimal and I hate the

1308
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,450
word preach there sorry I'm trying to

1309
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:09,500
break myself of that habit but I suggest

1310
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:12,440
a more minimal approach kind of like a

1311
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:15,470
Marie Kondo approach to tidying up our

1312
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,970
things so that we can focus on less know

1313
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:22,550
but know them deeper and hopefully that

1314
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:25,220
leads to more

1315
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:27,110
value being delivered I just don't think

1316
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:29,990
you can find that Neal and the haystack

1317
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:31,640
of 4,000 items but if you have put the

1318
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:35,030
time in to get good at rationalizing

1319
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:37,730
things and only have a you know a much

1320
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:40,490
smaller number to review you might be

1321
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,960
able to have a grasp on your product and

1322
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:45,200
your market and your customers better

1323
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,160
yeah and I totally agree with that I I

1324
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,770
got a I got a workshop from um David

1325
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:56,770
Starr who's a very good friend I didn't

1326
01:07:51,770 --> 01:08:00,440
Seattle I don't know you know David

1327
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:04,010
David's awesome and he he wrote a

1328
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:06,170
workshop that he provide uh he had a

1329
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:08,450
family emergency and I had to take over

1330
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:11,750
a gig of heads I think I was pretty much

1331
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:13,550
just the first PST he met and after he

1332
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:16,220
found out the bad news that he had to

1333
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:18,170
deal with and so I took took on this

1334
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:21,230
this gig so he provided some workshops

1335
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:27,710
and things around it but the workshop

1336
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:31,040
was a requirements gathering workshop

1337
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:32,750
and effectively it's got some stuff

1338
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,910
around it but effectively what you do is

1339
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:38,000
you take a bunch of people who are going

1340
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:40,339
to be working on backlog and you take

1341
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,299
some screen from the application that

1342
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:47,330
they've already worked on before and you

1343
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:49,730
get them to create user stories based on

1344
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:51,200
you know their their hindsight of

1345
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:54,440
knowledge that they've got knowing

1346
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:57,650
everything that's going on yeah and so

1347
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,870
the III talk about user stories and I

1348
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:02,299
talk about scenarios so given the way in

1349
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:04,190
thence walk through all of that with

1350
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:06,560
them show them what good ones look like

1351
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:08,030
and then get them to work on breaking

1352
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,290
this down it usually takes like an hour

1353
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:16,339
and a half for them to do that but then

1354
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:19,390
at the end of that they have a very

1355
01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:23,960
intricate set of backlog and behaviors

1356
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:26,540
that represent the work that the new had

1357
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:30,380
to go in to building that thing that

1358
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:31,970
make sense yeah so then we put that put

1359
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:34,460
that to the site

1360
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:37,860
take something out of your back look

1361
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:39,870
some item in your backlog something

1362
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,280
usually with a UI because it's just

1363
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:45,180
easier for people to understand and

1364
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:47,520
interact with and put that put that user

1365
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:52,260
story on the board now do the same thing

1366
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:54,030
and they've they've now realized the

1367
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,700
amount of detail that they had to go

1368
01:09:54,030 --> 01:10:01,530
into to describe the thing they've done

1369
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:04,670
in the past and I had I did it with a

1370
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:09,360
group where we had engineers architects

1371
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:15,210
bees we had business folks we had the

1372
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:17,070
the the entire PMO office there and we

1373
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:20,750
did that exercise and halfway through

1374
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:24,360
the second exercise the the head of

1375
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:27,330
product management stopped the whole

1376
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:33,720
workshop and and he said that this does

1377
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:36,450
we fundamentally are not ready to go

1378
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:39,690
into this level to even understand what

1379
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:42,750
these things are and that to me was a

1380
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:47,600
was a shocking realization for a company

1381
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:54,180
to realize that they didn't have the

1382
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:57,450
fundamental understanding nor ability to

1383
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,850
create an order backlog and that was

1384
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:05,820
with with 20 people in the room focused

1385
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:08,220
on doing just that task yeah I don't

1386
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:10,950
know if I where I stole this idea from

1387
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:13,590
or heard about it or or if I just came

1388
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:17,880
up with it but I have had teams in the

1389
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:20,910
past kind of do what I call retroactive

1390
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,470
refinement so go back and refine an

1391
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,840
estimate something you've already done

1392
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:27,540
like what you just described and with

1393
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,070
now with the benefit of hindsight what

1394
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,450
would we know and they're like oh well

1395
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:32,490
we would do this and we would ask us to

1396
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:35,490
made it like this and we would use that

1397
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:37,440
exercise to create anchor stories so

1398
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:39,000
that we would post on the wall in our

1399
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,520
team space and say you know what

1400
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,410
remember when we were refine this retro

1401
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,300
actively we all said this is what a five

1402
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:49,929
looks like and this is the level of

1403
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:53,440
to the tasks that it spawned and it's

1404
01:11:49,929 --> 01:11:54,610
fun and then we have a new item off our

1405
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,840
backlog that everybody says we don't

1406
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,730
understand this very well we're like

1407
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,159
okay but which of those things does it

1408
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:02,590
look like like oh well it's a lot like

1409
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:04,540
that thing okay that's probably a good

1410
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:06,849
starting point to think about what what

1411
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:09,040
did we need to think about to do that

1412
01:12:06,849 --> 01:12:12,730
thing we probably need to think about

1413
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:15,639
the same things to do this new thing so

1414
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:17,260
I love that workshop the other thing

1415
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:19,059
that when you were talking it kind of

1416
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:23,440
made me think about was this idea of

1417
01:12:19,059 --> 01:12:25,540
like a backlog snake which was an

1418
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,909
exercise that I've done at a number of

1419
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,590
clients where I took their backlog and I

1420
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:31,840
printed it out you know sometimes

1421
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:33,579
hundreds of items and I arranged a

1422
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,559
conference room in such a way that all

1423
01:12:33,579 --> 01:12:39,520
these tables form like kind of like this

1424
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:41,619
snake shape and I put my designated I

1425
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,869
had this kind of fun stuffed animal at

1426
01:12:41,619 --> 01:12:46,270
one end of the of the table and it was

1427
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:49,449
the snake's head and then I had the tail

1428
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:51,790
of the snake at the other end and I said

1429
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:53,619
okay now take everything and it the most

1430
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:55,179
important thing goes at the head and the

1431
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:57,849
least important thing goes at the tail

1432
01:12:55,179 --> 01:13:00,639
and they were able to order and

1433
01:12:57,849 --> 01:13:03,070
prioritize hundreds and hundreds of

1434
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:06,010
items by just laying them all out on on

1435
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:07,599
these tables so the things at the end

1436
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:09,190
became the most important the things at

1437
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:10,210
the end at the other hand became the

1438
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,679
least important and then what the

1439
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:13,300
product owner was able to do is like

1440
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,739
they were able to go about midway

1441
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,780
through and be like from this point on

1442
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:18,130
all these things just throw away we

1443
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,320
don't even need them we'll never get to

1444
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:24,540
him let's just focus on these hundred

1445
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,969
things and we we drastically trimmed the

1446
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:30,849
product backlog in mass as a team as it

1447
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:32,619
actually is a whole group of teams and

1448
01:13:30,849 --> 01:13:34,420
was it it wasn't perfect and there was

1449
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:36,699
price and things we tossed away that we

1450
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:39,130
had two that came back but that's

1451
01:13:36,699 --> 01:13:40,960
another one of the things that I I teach

1452
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:43,119
is if something is really important

1453
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,040
it'll come back yeah you're not gonna

1454
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:48,099
forget about that amazing that you want

1455
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:51,659
to build but if it never comes back have

1456
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:56,380
you heard of a tool called email amnesty

1457
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:59,400
no so they have it was a plugin for for

1458
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:02,820
Outlook or people that have ridiculous

1459
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:05,699
numbers of unread items in their inbox I

1460
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:08,429
know people that have 25,000 plus unread

1461
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:11,940
items and their their their inbox and

1462
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:15,510
what you know amnesty did was it scammed

1463
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:20,699
through your entire inbox and for each

1464
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:24,000
unread email that you had or each person

1465
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:27,840
that you had an unread email from it

1466
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,960
created an email to them attached all of

1467
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,900
the unread emails and said in the body

1468
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,659
I'm declaring an email amnesty I have

1469
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:39,000
too much crap in my inbox and please

1470
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:42,810
send back to me things that you think

1471
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,050
are still important and then it sends it

1472
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:48,719
out and it China I don't know how much

1473
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:51,989
of a tool it did for for for collecting

1474
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,179
responses but it meant that you know

1475
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:58,530
probably more than 50 percent of your

1476
01:14:54,179 --> 01:15:02,130
emails are gonna bounce yeah and then

1477
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:04,560
you have a bunch of emails that somebody

1478
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,390
gets 10 things and they go well these

1479
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,210
two things are still important the rest

1480
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:11,610
I don't care about anymore

1481
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:15,900
so suddenly I paired down that list and

1482
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:18,750
I've encouraged organizations to do that

1483
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:21,320
with their backlog items you know

1484
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:24,900
declare our backlog amnesty you've get

1485
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:28,260
25,000 things in your backlog you can't

1486
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:35,520
get to 25,000 things said send them back

1487
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:41,040
and see what comes your way yeah yeah

1488
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:43,409
that's I launched a in activity at a

1489
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,080
client that was kind of a mixture of

1490
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:53,429
that it wasn't really amnesty but it was

1491
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:56,670
this massive Kaizen event around getting

1492
01:15:53,429 --> 01:16:01,020
our backlog under control and I started

1493
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:03,600
to dub it a mixture of the Marie Kondo

1494
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,770
method and the debt snowball method from

1495
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,179
Dave Ramsey I don't know are you

1496
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:09,030
familiar with either of those two names

1497
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:11,760
Marie Kondo with Marie Kondo she says

1498
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:13,880
you should only have five board games is

1499
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,190
that what she says

1500
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:24,449
it's probably zero you joy and I'm like

1501
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:26,730
well all these bring them joy no in a

1502
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:30,960
nutshell really what it is is is we took

1503
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:32,520
this giant backlog and we dispatched of

1504
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,590
a whole bunch of it right away

1505
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,630
just because it was old and the product

1506
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:39,030
owner could easily go through and know

1507
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:42,960
what was valuable and what could just be

1508
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:44,880
deleted so we did that then with what

1509
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,770
was left we met when and met with all

1510
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,260
the stakeholders and we said you know

1511
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:50,909
what is the value of this we're going

1512
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:57,300
through it and this was kind of the

1513
01:16:50,909 --> 01:16:59,280
organization step of the backlog but the

1514
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:02,940
Marie Kondo method you know of tidying

1515
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:05,369
up our backlog and we explained I got on

1516
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:08,340
my soapbox like 25 times gave the same

1517
01:17:05,369 --> 01:17:11,040
little mini speech to this different

1518
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,750
stakeholders 25 times and said here's

1519
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,090
why it's important for you to let go of

1520
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:17,309
some things because if you want this

1521
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:18,540
you've got to let go of this because

1522
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:20,099
this is the crushing weight of the

1523
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:22,710
backlog warrants why we're not getting

1524
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:24,630
anything done so we were able to get the

1525
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,040
a lot of stakeholders say you know what

1526
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:29,070
you're right we don't need that anymore

1527
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:32,190
the windows past for that etc focus on

1528
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:35,340
these two or three things we did that 15

1529
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:37,429
20 25 times then we apply Dave Ramsey's

1530
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,780
model of the debt snowball which is

1531
01:17:37,429 --> 01:17:41,010
sometimes kind of productive and you got

1532
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,980
to be careful with it but it's doing

1533
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:46,079
small things first so we were able to

1534
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:49,020
get a whole bunch of small things done

1535
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:51,179
which then allowed us to do less contact

1536
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:54,599
switching more focus on the bigger

1537
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:57,840
things so we might have done some less

1538
01:17:54,599 --> 01:18:00,510
valuable work early but it was it paid

1539
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,360
us back in less context switching in

1540
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:06,239
time and focus and that's kind of this

1541
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:09,090
this snowball thing of paying off your

1542
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:11,579
small bills so that you can then put big

1543
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:14,969
lumps of sum and big payments down on

1544
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:16,469
your really big bills and the

1545
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:21,179
organization loved it

1546
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:24,480
but but it took a while to get it done

1547
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:26,570
but man it just led to all types of

1548
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,370
phenomenal conversations about that

1549
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:31,280
you and priorities and competing

1550
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:33,350
priorities and all these things that we

1551
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,350
talk about every day it's super

1552
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:41,260
difficult III find that product owners

1553
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:44,030
really struggle to have any kind of

1554
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:46,150
reasonable priority or good

1555
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:50,420
understanding of the product backlog or

1556
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:54,650
even to be able to be empowered to do

1557
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:56,660
that and I think that's that's that's an

1558
01:18:54,650 --> 01:19:00,580
organizational issue it comes from the

1559
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:06,260
the hierarchical tailor istic practices

1560
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:08,330
that we're used to and backing off from

1561
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:12,290
those ideas is is really difficult have

1562
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:17,090
you have you seen the the I I do M I did

1563
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:18,800
our session a little while ago I guess

1564
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:23,270
what did I call it the tyranny of

1565
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:27,110
Taylorism and how to spot agile bs yes

1566
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:30,230
that one I did and I'm seeing your

1567
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:35,230
content yeah yeah so the the that that

1568
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:39,770
piece at the start where I talk about

1569
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:42,530
where Taylorism came from is something

1570
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:48,440
that I I do in almost all of my classes

1571
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:53,530
maybe not a PSF but a poly and a PSM I

1572
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,530
always cover that because I I think that

1573
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:59,740
too many too many folks dismiss this

1574
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,060
waterfall thing that they've heard of

1575
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:03,590
yeah they talk about it as waterfall

1576
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:06,170
which is where those big backlogs that

1577
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,580
are difficult to prioritize come from

1578
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:10,100
because we have to have a list of

1579
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:12,440
everything before we start and we have

1580
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,600
to spend six months in analysis before

1581
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:16,820
we do anything that that that's maybe an

1582
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,470
exaggeration but depends on the

1583
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:22,670
organization that you're working with

1584
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:25,010
and and bringing that down to you know I

1585
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:29,000
just need to two weeks work for the team

1586
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:30,650
I need a big team busy for a couple of

1587
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,500
weeks and then that will give me a

1588
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:37,040
couple of weeks to come up with more

1589
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:39,020
stuff to keep that team busy and getting

1590
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,939
that yeah that that balance is really

1591
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:42,119
important

1592
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:45,579
I'm glad you enjoyed that that I'm

1593
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:49,539
session that I did I did I really liked

1594
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:51,429
it I love this thought of or not the

1595
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:53,169
thought but the understanding the

1596
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:55,659
history of Taylorism and how it

1597
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:58,809
influences modern-day thinking and the

1598
01:20:55,659 --> 01:21:00,999
relationship with Gant and other

1599
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:02,800
contemporaries about you know how work

1600
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:06,099
used to get done in this idea of there

1601
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,510
being one best way to do something well

1602
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:10,499
that does something better that this is

1603
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:13,449
something we fight against every day

1604
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:14,800
yeah no such thing as best practice on

1605
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:19,510
y'all have to quit practices for the

1606
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:22,959
situation at hand that's right only a

1607
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:27,610
generally useful practice that works in

1608
01:21:22,959 --> 01:21:30,130
some context exactly exactly so we know

1609
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:33,760
we have been we have been rambling for

1610
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:37,599
an hour and 20 minutes so I think it's

1611
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:40,479
probably good idea to to wrap it up

1612
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:43,179
sure so if you could just do you have

1613
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:48,459
anything you're working on next you have

1614
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:50,320
any public classes anything you want so

1615
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:52,329
yeah I do have some public classes

1616
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:56,590
couple will be out on the scrum ador'd

1617
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:59,530
site their home cities are Columbus and

1618
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:04,329
st. Louis right now please go take a

1619
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:07,659
look at those I am about to launch a

1620
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:13,570
website called no boring no boring

1621
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:16,150
retros dot-com and even though no boring

1622
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:19,239
retros is the the title because that's

1623
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:21,070
something I'm very very passionate about

1624
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:23,499
it's just gonna kind of serve as a

1625
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:25,479
portal for all of my content so my

1626
01:22:23,499 --> 01:22:29,289
podcast appearances things like this

1627
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:31,419
just my random thoughts but there will

1628
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:33,309
be kind of a big section of the site

1629
01:22:31,419 --> 01:22:35,469
dedicated of retrospectives and all that

1630
01:22:33,309 --> 01:22:40,389
because I am a big believer in the power

1631
01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:41,979
of retrospectives so yeah look for that

1632
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:43,269
and then I also love for people to

1633
01:22:41,979 --> 01:22:44,860
connect with me on LinkedIn I mean

1634
01:22:43,269 --> 01:22:47,889
that's kind of how I stay in touch with

1635
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:50,169
my colleagues and my students right or

1636
01:22:47,889 --> 01:22:51,580
wrong I'm not a great social media maven

1637
01:22:50,169 --> 01:22:53,680
so LinkedIn is

1638
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,920
kind of the the preferred way to get in

1639
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:59,140
touch with me well I managed to get

1640
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,240
LinkedIn streaming-enabled on my account

1641
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:05,230
so this was going out live on LinkedIn

1642
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,850
so you'll be able to go tag that that I

1643
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,500
don't know how you do that and even

1644
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:11,200
write bit I don't think you can figure

1645
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,640
it out yeah that the LinkedIn streaming

1646
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,960
is super new so it's a little bit

1647
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:18,040
difficult to find stuff after the fact

1648
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,810
the other platforms are a little bit

1649
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,190
easier because they're more mature but

1650
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:25,270
that's awesome we'll definitely look

1651
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:30,090
forward to to that and I think in in in

1652
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:36,220
that vein and if anybody has any

1653
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:39,070
feedback review of how we organize this

1654
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:43,420
how we set it up maybe just the audio or

1655
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:46,840
it could be how much of a plan we had

1656
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:49,240
for the this sprint which was not very

1657
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,950
much we had a very loose plan how much

1658
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,050
we got off topic maybe you like that

1659
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:55,090
maybe you didn't um it would be really

1660
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:58,750
useful to get to get feedback on that

1661
01:23:55,090 --> 01:24:02,680
and hopefully Jim and I will have maybe

1662
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:07,180
a retro and maybe we we do this again at

1663
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:08,560
