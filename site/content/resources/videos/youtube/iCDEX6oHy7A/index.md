As I sit here in Scotland, reflecting on a recent conversation with my good friend Jim from the Midwest, I can’t help but think about the challenges many organisations face on their agile journey. Jim reached out to me with a pressing question: how do we train development teams to embrace an agile mindset? This is a topic that resonates deeply with me, and I believe it’s crucial for the success of any agile transformation.

### Understanding the Core Issue

From what Jim shared, it seems that the developers in his colleague's organisation are struggling to engage with agile principles. They’re not validating their work, failing to seek feedback from customers, and, most concerning, they appear indifferent to the quality of their output. This isn’t just a technical issue; it’s a cultural one. 

In my experience, when teams are disengaged, it often stems from a lack of intrinsic motivation. As Dan Pink discusses in his book *Drive*, autonomy, mastery, and purpose are key to fostering a motivated workforce. If these elements are missing, it’s no wonder that developers might not care about the quality of their work or the needs of their customers.

### The Role of Leadership

So, how do we address this? First and foremost, leadership must step up. It’s not just about teaching technical skills like Test-Driven Development (TDD) or pair programming; it’s about creating an environment where developers feel empowered to take ownership of their work. This means fostering a culture that values quality and craftsmanship.

Here are a few strategies that I recommend:

- **Encourage Autonomy**: Give teams the freedom to make decisions about their work. This can lead to a greater sense of ownership and responsibility.
- **Promote Mastery**: Invest in training and development opportunities. Encourage developers to continuously improve their skills and take pride in their craftsmanship.
- **Clarify Purpose**: Help teams understand the impact of their work. When developers see how their contributions affect customers, they’re more likely to care about the quality of their output.

### Bridging the Gap Between Technical Skills and Mindset

While it’s essential to teach agile practices, we must also focus on shifting mindsets. This is where the real challenge lies. It’s not enough to simply implement agile methodologies; we need to cultivate an agile mindset throughout the organisation.

One effective approach I’ve found is to engage teams in retrospectives that focus on both technical and cultural aspects. For instance, after completing a project, gather the team to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how they can improve moving forward. This not only helps in refining processes but also reinforces the importance of quality and customer feedback.

### The Importance of Quality

Quality should never be an afterthought. In a manufacturing-focused business, the analogy of craftsmanship is particularly relevant. Just as a master craftsman takes pride in their work, so too should software developers. They need to understand that delivering high-quality software is not just about meeting deadlines; it’s about creating value for customers.

To instil this sense of pride, consider implementing practices such as:

- **Code Reviews**: Encourage peer reviews to foster a culture of quality and collaboration.
- **Pair Programming**: This not only improves code quality but also facilitates knowledge sharing among team members.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Establish mechanisms for regular feedback from customers and stakeholders to ensure that the product meets their needs.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, training development teams on agile and scrum is not merely about imparting technical skills; it’s about nurturing a culture that values quality, craftsmanship, and customer feedback. By focusing on intrinsic motivation and creating an environment where developers feel empowered, we can bridge the gap between technical skills and the agile mindset.

As we navigate this new way of working, let’s remember that agility is not just a set of practices; it’s a fundamental shift in how we approach our work. It requires commitment, transparency, and a willingness to adapt. If we can foster these values within our teams, we’ll be well on our way to achieving true agility. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this topic. How have you approached training and cultural change in your organisation? Let’s continue the conversation!
