1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
so what is the best application of scrum

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,319
in the world I I don't think I could I

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,519
could uh mention at best but the

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,940
implementation that I respect the most

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,740
is probably the Azure devops teams at

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,080
Microsoft

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,180
um that took a waterfall product that

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,160
they delivered once every two years with

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,980
significant amounts of technical debt

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,880
and over eight years uh moved it towards

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:36,420
this uh uh Club they they closed the the

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,280
the chasm they were able to build a

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,280
product that really resonated with their

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,700
customers and they were able to

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,059
um go from man it used to took them

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,559
20 plus hours to build their product and

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,500
they got it down to three and a half

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,280
minutes that's an application of

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,280
effectiveness
