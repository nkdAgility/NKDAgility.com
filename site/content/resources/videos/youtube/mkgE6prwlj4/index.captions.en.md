So what is the best application of Scrum in the world? I don't think I could mention the best, but the implementation that I respect the most is probably the Azure DevOps teams at Microsoft. 

Um, they took a waterfall product that they delivered once every two years with significant amounts of technical debt and over eight years, uh, moved it towards this, uh, uh, club. They closed the chasm; they were able to build a product that really resonated with their customers. 

And they were able to, um, go from, man, it used to take them 20 plus hours to build their product, and they got it down to three and a half minutes. That's an application of effectiveness.
