## Spotlight on Outstanding Scrum Application

What might you consider to be the best application of Scrum in the world?

While it's tough to single out one application as 'the' greatest, at the same time and it's hard to declare a definitive 'best,' I definitely want to spotlight one implementation that never fails to impress me.

That's right. We're talking about the Azure DevOps teams at Microsoft. This team never fails to have my admiration and respect.

## Transitioning From Waterfall to Scrum

The DevOps team at Microsoft bravely took a product traditionally delivered through a waterfall methodology, saddled with heaps of technical debt, and managed to create a product that hits the right note with their customers.

Over about eight years, this team has managed to bridge the gap, pivoting towards Scrum and building a product that truly resonates with customers. ðŸ’¡

## Projecting Forward with Efficiency

Now, this is what I call accelerating towards progress!

Get this. Here's something that will blow your mind - this team went from a build time of 20-plus hours to a mind-blowing 3.5 minutes! ðŸš€

Now, this is an impressive prime example of how effective Scrum can be when implemented right.
