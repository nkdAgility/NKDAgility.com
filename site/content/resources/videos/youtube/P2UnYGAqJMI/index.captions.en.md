Burnd downs are a key indicator of agile banditry going on. Burnd downs encourage teams to plan too far in the future. Whether it's a Sprint burndown or a product burndown, we're planning too far ahead if we have enough data to understand where we currently are and where we're eventually going in number of items. This is why we talk about goals and D action in Scrum and agile. We want to be focused on those things, which means we probably don't understand the details and don't have enough information to even create a burndown. Don't be agile bandits.
