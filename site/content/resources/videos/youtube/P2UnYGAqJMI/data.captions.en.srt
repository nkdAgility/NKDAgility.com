1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,759
burnd Downs are a key indicator of agile

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:11,440
banditry going on burnd Downs encourage

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,799
teams to plan too far in the future

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,920
whether it's a Sprint burndown or a

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,240
product burndown we're planning too far

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,240
ahead if we have enough data to

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,760
understand where we currently are and

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,640
where we're eventually going in number

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
of

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:33,480
items this is why uh uh we talk about

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,360
goals and D action in scrum and agile we

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,079
want to be focused on those things which

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,320
means we probably don't understand the

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,719
details don't have enough information to

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,399
even create a burndown don't be agile

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,399
