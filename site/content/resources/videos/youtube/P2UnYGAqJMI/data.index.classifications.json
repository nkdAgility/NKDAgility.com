    "reasoning": "While the article critically discusses Agile burndown charts, planning techniques, and continuous flow—relevant to certain aspects of software delivery—it clearly targets Agile/Scrum process optimization. Direct references to Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) are absent. There is a limited—though not zero—overlap: the discussion around planning, iterative adaptation, and product lifetime touches on the 'development' and 'maintenance' aspects of ALM, but omits governance, compliance, risk management, metrics, or tooling central to ALM. Advice is framed for Agile practitioners, with little to no exploration of the broader, end-to-end lifecycle, or long-term application management. Penalties were applied to Direct Mentions (no ALM terms), Conceptual Alignment (focus is incomplete for ALM), and Depth (excludes full lifecycle/governance/compliance). The final confidence reflects a partial mapping but significant category mismatch.",

    "reasoning": "The content critiques Agile burndown charts and advocates a shift toward minimal planning and continuous value delivery. Its themes superficially nod to elements relevant for Agentic Engineering, like adaptability and decentralizing planning. However, it does not explicitly discuss maximizing human or AI agency, systemic observability, or ethical AI. The philosophy leans more toward classic Agile/Lean than the intentional engineering of agency. There are few, if any, direct mentions of Agentic Engineering or its signature practices. The primary audience (Agile practitioners) somewhat overlaps, but key Agentic Engineering concepts are missing or only weakly implied.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article promotes adaptive, flow-based Agile practices, it lacks substantive connection to Agentic Engineering—omitting direct engagement with developer/AI agency, systemic observability, or deliberate agentic systems. Relevance is tangential rather than core.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on Agile planning pitfalls and advocates continuous flow and minimal planning in teams. It does not reference agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, agent/human synergy, contextual intelligence, or modern agent-focused delivery practices. There is no substantive discussion of agentic principles, nor is there mention of autonomous systems, AI, governance, observability, or feedback loops as defined. The audience (Agile teams, coaches) somewhat overlaps but the substance is misaligned. The closest match relates to continuous flow and outcome orientation, but this is framed in classic Agile terms, not agentic or AI-powered delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content covers Agile planning issues and continuous flow, but lacks any discussion of agentic software delivery, autonomous agents, or relevant AI integration. It does not fit the category except for tangentially related delivery principles.",
