One of the most influential people in Agile for me is Ralph Yakum. He is the author of the Professional Scrum Product Owner book from Scrum.org. He is a great colleague. I met him at Agile in Africa for the first time; we met in Ghana of all places. Oh, he just really connects and understands and helps connect me as well to product ownership and product management. He's just amazing at that stuff.
