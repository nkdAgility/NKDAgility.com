1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,160
the question is are there any scrum

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,440
courses that teach you how to scale um

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,000
and the answer is no there's not there's

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,199
not any scrum courses that teach you how

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,880
to scale but there are scrum courses

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,000
that help you understand the tools and

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,359
techniques that you can use to build

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,039
your own scaling framework that's

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,719
probably the best way to describe it um

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,960
um every

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,520
successful um organization that I've

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,559
seen operating at scale um I've worked

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,680
with organizations with uh 600 people

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,559
working on one product I've worked with

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,280
organizations um that have 4 and a half

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,719
thousand people working on one product

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,800
uh these are all scaling situations

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,320
those are Mega scaling situations for

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,199
most organizations you're probably

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,479
looking at at um just two or three or

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,920
maybe four or five scrum teams working

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,720
together delivering value but they have

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,400
to deliver it together I'm working on an

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,400
engagement right now uh where we've got

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,360
about 13 teams working together on one

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,600
common outcome um and how do you how do

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,280
you scale that and the answer is that

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,119
there is no prescribed way to scale you

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,600
have to find a way that works for your

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,000
organization

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,520
uh so the course that that that we have

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,240
H scaled professional scrum scaling

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,520
professional scrum um is uh from

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,920
scrum.org and it focuses on a a little

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
bit around a framework right but that's

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,200
a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny part of this

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,240
course right um the the Nexus framework

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,119
uh what that we talk about is not really

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,119
much more than scrum and it talks about

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,759
3 to nine teams is working together on

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:11,200
one outcome uh but what it does heavily

42
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:14,879
focus on um the the course focuses on

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,640
about 50 different practices that you

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,480
can use to help you build your own

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,319
scaling framework just like scrum is not

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,160
a method for delivering software scrum

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,879
is a framework around which you can

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,800
build your own method for delivering

49
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,519
software in the same way Nexus is not a

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
method for delivering software it's a

51
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:42,280
framework a scaffolding so that we make

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,080
sure that we're not missing something as

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,519
we continue to build and iterate on our

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,200
own framework what practices are going

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,480
to work for you in building uh uh your

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
your your scaling framework for your

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,640
your teams in your organization um and

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
please do not start with everything in

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,680
the kitchen sink

60
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,360
that's a bad place to start you want to

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,400
start small what's the smallest thing we

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,519
can improve and change um and then

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,280
what's the next thing after that what's

64
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,760
the next thing after that to make things

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,560
a little bit better and you'll build a

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,480
framework that's suited specifically for

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,120
the product specifically for the the the

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,239
the organization that you're in that

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,400
entity of of of your organization um

70
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,920
so that's a lot of work right the the

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,760
scaling class that we have is not going

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,959
to teach you how to install a scaling

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,439
framework in your organization it's

74
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,000
going to teach you the

75
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,959
foundations of you being able to build

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,480
your own scaling framework that fits

77
00:03:51,959 --> 00:04:00,200
your organization like a glove um I

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,200
think that is the best way

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,280
to enable

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,159
scaling um there's a little bit of a

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,560
Kickstart there's some things that

82
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,319
that's definitely very common uh if

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,439
you're if you're interested the two

84
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,799
things uh that you really need to focus

85
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:20,519
on is uh dependency management that's

86
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,759
the killer for most organizations so we

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,600
spend a ton of time uh talking about and

88
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,320
dealing with dependency management and

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,680
the other one is

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,280
alignment alignment between your your

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,039
product the organization and the people

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,759
right you need alignment there that

93
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:43,320
things smoothly flow through that system

94
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,280
if the architecture is different from

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
the way you organize the people the

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,720
architecture of your product is

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,919
different from the way you organize the

98
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,560
people it's going to generate friction

99
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,440
so the the the tools and techniques that

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,240
we deliver in the course about 50

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
different practices we might not talk

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,479
about all of them but there's 50

103
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,840
different practices in the pot um are

104
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:09,039
all there to help you figure out how to

105
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
best scale your product and your teams

106
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919

107
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,120
