No content addresses human-AI partnerships, agent design, or decision-making leveraging AI, which are core to the 'Collective Intelligence' category. There are only minor tangential alignments, as organizational culture and iterative adaptation are empowerment themes that can support future collective intelligence but are not explored in an AI context.

Although the topic is about software delivery at scale and touches on iterative improvement, alignment, and feedback loops (which are *also* themes in agentic delivery), the framing, intent, and substance are traditional Scrum/agile scaling without agentic principles.
