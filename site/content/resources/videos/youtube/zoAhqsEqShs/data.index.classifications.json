However, it does not explicitly present or analyze any conceptual models or frameworks essential to the 'Model' category. While there are mentions of Agile and DevOps principles, the discussion lacks depth in exploring how specific models influence decision-making or enhance organizational agility. Thus, while there is some relevance, it does not meet the primary focus required for the 'Model' category.",
