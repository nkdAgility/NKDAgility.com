While it references feedback loops, team commitment, and improved ways of working, it rarely addresses defining, measuring, or using real customer outcomes as an anchor for change. The closest mention is linking workforce happiness to customer experience, but this is not actionable or evidence-based. Value is discussed primarily in terms of team or organizational benefit, not customer impact. Audience focus is on practitioners but not customer outcome strategists. Signal-to-noise is moderate due to promotion and generic agile themes.",
