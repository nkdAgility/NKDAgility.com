1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,620
um that's a really good question what's

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,360
the most interesting outcome

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,880
because it can be interesting good and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,640
it can be interesting bad right I I have

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,900
had the expedience

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,939
um we'll start with the interesting part

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,560
right or it depends how you look at it

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,840
it depends how you look at it it could

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
also be interesting Goods right

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,580
um but I had this experience with a

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,000
company in the United States that was a

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,059
very old-school type of company

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,219
uh put it this way the the the the the

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,079
the the cubes

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,940
uh if you're not familiar with the way

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,879
things work in the US you often have

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,559
these uh cubicles with partitions

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,180
temporary partitions around each desk

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
where you've got a finite amount of

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,559
space and that's yours and they're quite

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,739
high so you don't hear other people but

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,980
there's big big cubicle thing and the

23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,100
cubicles had awk paneling

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,019
that's that's how how old school this

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,479
this organization was and how much how

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,220
much money was going around and one of

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,140
the problems with organizations with

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,540
huge amounts of cash flow and huge

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,700
amounts of cash to throw around is that

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,600
they're not that interested in change

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,180
right because change is risk and if we

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,420
have a huge Cash Cow that we're milking

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,960
then then why should we change and

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,600
potentially risk that that cash cow

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,280
um which is why Ken kench Weber talks

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,140
about the the time to go into an

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,840
organization and affect change is when

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,880
they've most egregiously failed to

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,220
deliver something right that's when

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,060
people are most open to change

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,420
but uh in this organization

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,640
um I did a whole bunch of of sessions uh

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,920
it was was kind of devops and agile it

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,659
was all homegrown it wasn't it was

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,420
probably prior to doing a lot of stuff

46
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,880
with a lot more stuff with scrumdorg

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,880
um but I managed to convince the 30

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,439
people in it leadership and management

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,299
that

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,860
um this agile and devops thing is a

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,420
great idea we need to move towards

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,940
continuous delivery we need to move

53
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,620
towards inspecting and adapting causing

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,599
the feedback loops Gathering data

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,860
figuring out what's going on so this

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,440
this

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:27,000
it was totally sold on this idea

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,940
um and then I I heard about the

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,319
like eight months later maybe a year

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,700
later

61
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,319
um I heard about that engagement and

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,540
they were all gone from that

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,760
organization they'd all been they'd all

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,700
effectively been fired because the

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,099
organization had decided not to go that

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,840
way anymore so as an organization we're

67
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,280
not going to do Agile we're not going to

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,319
do continuous delivery we're going to do

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,940
the same thing we've always done and

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,099
they kicked up a fuss right because

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,420
they're like well no that's not not good

72
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,680
we're gonna have these problems we're

73
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,840
gonna have huge amounts of technical

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,940
debt we're gonna have potential failures

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,040
going down the line and they were enough

76
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,819
of a problem that that they were gotten

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,400
rid of right so that's kind of

78
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,980
negative but I don't know if you think

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,019
about it it's probably those folks went

80
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,000
on to better jobs to more advantageous

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,379
organizations that are trying to do

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,659
things a little bit differently and

83
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,120
perhaps they had a better outcome for

84
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,560
for most of those folks so that was a

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,239
big negative one

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,159
um that's probably the most the most

87
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,780
negative one that that I've seen and

88
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,920
that was an unusual circumstance right

89
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,780
you don't see that sort of thing

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,580
happening that often

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,800
um but the other one uh the most

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,799
positive positive one

93
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,739
uh was training for one of my favorite

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,659
favorite organizations at the time which

95
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,080
is actually in Utah which is a crazy

96
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,060
place but it was in Utah and um it was

97
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,220
for a company called back country and

98
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,060
back country where our clothing kind of

99
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,440
clothing manufacturer clothing uh ski it

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,659
was where um you know where the the

101
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,540
Olympics were held at one time in in

102
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,760
Utah and you know basically from their

103
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,519
office you can see the the ski jump and

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,659
all the things that are around that and

105
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,760
they trained

106
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,019
um everybody in their company

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,519
so there was a really interesting

108
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,400
organization because there were less

109
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,220
than 100 people in the whole company and

110
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,900
48 of them were software engineers

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,720
so this is a clothing company why do

112
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,520
they have 48

113
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,620
of their company being nearly 50 of the

114
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,500
company being software Engineers

115
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,600
um and it was that they built and ran

116
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,940
their own procurement software

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,880
so their their software that they use to

118
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,620
get the stuff to to to to to to organize

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,960
the factories in in China that were

120
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,259
making making the apparel get all the

121
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,240
apparel across into the US and get it

122
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,100
distributed in the US they're different

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,900
warehouses and then you get to get it

124
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,580
sent out to individuals because they ran

125
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,520
their own points of sale as well they

126
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,940
had five or six different storefronts

127
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,979
that were all their brands and they also

128
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,199
had not only their clothes but other

129
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,639
competitors clothes on their own website

130
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,520
as well

131
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,800
that was all their own kit right they

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,900
built all the software the guy driving

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,259
around the warehouse with an iPad

134
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,240
attached to his uh a forklift telling

135
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,060
him which pallets to go get and pick up

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,759
and what trucks to put them on they

137
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,960
wrote the whole thing right

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,180
um so that's why they needed so many

139
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,919
software Engineers but it was hugely

140
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,320
effective for them

141
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,880
um so what we did was we did scrum

142
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,199
training we did the applying

143
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,940
professional scrum it was called

144
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,900
professional scrum foundations back in

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,600
the day it was actually my first ever uh

146
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,979
uh uh classes of that type that I that I

147
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,780
ran

148
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:49,320
um and there were very big classes there

149
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,880
was like 45 people per per class which

150
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,979
is which is pretty big I normally max

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,600
out at 25 now

152
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,360
and they trained everybody in the

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,940
company the CEO was in one of the

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,979
classes the CEO's secretary assistant

155
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,080
was in one of the classes the guy who

156
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,580
drives the forklift in the warehouse was

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,860
in one of the classes

158
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,539
and even things like the guy who drives

159
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,820
the forklift in the warehouse after the

160
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,720
first half day and went to his

161
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,639
management and said uh what what the

162
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,199
heck am I doing here obviously he drives

163
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,699
a forklift in the warehouse so I'm using

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
the polite version of the way he would

165
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,960
say it right what the heck am I doing

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
here this is of no value whatsoever

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
um can I just go back to to doing my

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,460
doing my work

169
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,259
and um you know his managers like oh

170
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,940
just just stick it out for today and if

171
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,160
you still have the same story at the end

172
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,199
of today then then you can you don't

173
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,319
have to go tomorrow right but but the

174
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,600
end of the first day he was the one uh

175
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,940
kind of standing up uh pointing at the

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,759
board with the team talking about the

177
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,380
different uh uh uh uh items on the

178
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,400
backlog and how they could add more

179
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,039
value

180
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,319
because he had an epiphany he had this

181
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,139
realization of the connection between

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,319
the feedback he can give

183
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:07,020
and the product that's then created

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,100
so he realized that he was uniquely

185
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:15,120
positioned to provide major influence to

186
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,740
the way the software worked for him to

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,840
better support the success of the

188
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,300
organization and it was this

189
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,699
I need to be involved in this I need to

190
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,259
be a part of this story and that was

191
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,160
that was just

192
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,960
fantastic uh thing to see and and hear a

193
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,280
little bit more to the story than than

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,319
that but I still get emails from people

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,080
in that organization and that's what

196
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,520
that would be 12 years later I still get

197
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
emails from people in the organization

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,319
saying it was a complete game changer

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
for the organization that experience and

200
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,900
I I can't take ownership of that right

201
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,479
they took ownership of that it was

202
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,460
can you imagine

203
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,780
everybody in the organization goes

204
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,020
through this training this training is

205
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:04,199
so important that the CEO says I'm going

206
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,300
to spend two full days sitting in a room

207
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,460
with all of these people and demonstrate

208
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,099
even if they know all the stuff already

209
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm going to sit here and demonstrate to

210
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,780
everybody in the room how important this

211
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,099
is how important it is to our strategy

212
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,879
going forward

213
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:23,819
