# What is the most interesting outcome you have achieved as an agile consultant?

A lot of organizations have begun to explore the opportunity of #agile because of the increased uncertainty and complexity of #projectmanagement and #productdevelopment environments.

The old style of working falls over when we encounter deeply complex environments and #agile has proven itself consistently great at helping people develop products and solutions despite complexity and uncertainty.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the most interesting outcomes he has witnessed or achieved as an #agileconsultant.
