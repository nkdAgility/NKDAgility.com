[Music]

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
i'm tired of you

5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,920
i can see hans has got his elmo ready

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
there

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
just in case we have some off-topic

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
conversations i have my elmo

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
uh

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,520
as well

11
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
um

12
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
so today we're going to be

13
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
looking at

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
how to run a daily scrum or introduction

15
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
to daily scrum um we want to have some

16
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
conversations around

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
um that idea of what is the daily scrum

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,599
and how it works

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,480
while we get started though

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,760
and we're going to do a little uh

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,200
exercise here um where

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,400
i have um five areas for five different

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
teams and in each of those areas um we

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
have

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,519
seven questions

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
and next to each of those questions we

27
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,640
have a green tick or a red cross

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
uh which you should be able to move

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
around okay

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,120
and what i would like it to do is i'm

31
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,599
going to create some breakout rooms i'll

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
add people manually after because

33
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,360
there's peter as well there goes the

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
neighborhood now peter's here

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,400
um

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,400
you're on mute peter

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,760
and his microphone is also up

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,920
yeah and you've got your microphones up

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
no i've got i've got a posh microphone

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,920
like you ah

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,920
porsche microphones are very handy

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah there we go

43
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
dude you're the the comedy relief

44
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
so um i was just introducing the the the

45
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,680
um

46
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
fast pass exercise at the start so what

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,599
i've got is a bunch of statements that

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
might be true or false

49
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,760
in each of the the boxes and they've got

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,239
a ticker across beside them so just

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
delete the one

52
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
that you don't think it is does that

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,799
make sense so leaving a ticker across if

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
you agree with it leave the take if you

55
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
disagree with it

56
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,159
leave the cross

57
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,840
not all of them

58
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,560
are true and that all of them are false

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
and some of them anna and i argued over

60
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
so

61
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,319
that that that shows that uh

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
even even those of us who do it all the

63
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,840
time are going to argue over some of

64
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
them and that's okay

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
uh so

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,239
the color coded hexis um because

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,160
hex hexagons are the best of guns is the

68
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,800
way i look at it

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,680
um i'm gonna put you in two rooms so

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,080
room one will be um

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,960
frank christian and anna and room two

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,080
will be uh buck hans and sean and we'll

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,919
just start off there i'll give you

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,639
seven minutes

75
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,880
to go around the seven questions

76
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
okay um but obviously you don't have to

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
go around them all and i will sort

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,400
everybody else out as they come in so i

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,520
clicked to open the rooms if you're

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,520
in room one start off at the pink top

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
left hexagon if you're in room two start

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,759
the green bottom left

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,639
uh hexagon that has all your questions

84
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,880
in it okay

85
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,240
perfect okay

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,240
hey erica how you doing

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,880
hi how are you

i'm good

89
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,039
hans is there a pop-up that says go to

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
going to a room or a button at the top

91
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,400
of your window next to the leave button

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,800
which says go to room two maybe

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
enter room two join room two

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
it's maybe just taking a second to spin

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,039
up

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
oh

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,759
we've got a little bit of reverb

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
i just muted you there because of some

99
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,800
reverb it it's just still spinning up

100
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
i've got a little spinner

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
um there we go and the only person

102
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
that's not made it in his hands

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
i'm going to click ask to join hands you

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,319
should have a little pop-up that says go

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
to room or a button next to the leave

106
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
button

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,759
at the top of your screen that says

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,759
join room

109
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,240
anything

110
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,039
well what i'll do is i will pop erica

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,039
i'll pop you in room two

112
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,840
and then i'll uh

113
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,199
try and sort out try and sort out hands

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,199
he's the troublemaker today

115
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,840
so i think you should end up in the room

116
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
in a couple of seconds erica

117
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
yes

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
cool

119
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
okay

120
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
oh yes

121
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,639
hands you have a lot of reverb i'm just

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
muting you again sorry

123
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
let's

124
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,479
try and assign you there

125
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
so i've clicked to assign you to another

126
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,639
room

127
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
let's see what happens

128
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,160
you should

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
oh well you need him yes

130
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,479
[Music]

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
perhaps he's now he's gone

132
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,759
okay he's gone

133
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
to another room yeah i put them in i put

134
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
them in room room one this time

135
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
um

136
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
so hopefully that will uh will help i

137
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
still i've still got a spinner it's

138
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
having trouble moving hands i think hans

139
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
is the troublemaker this time

140
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
it might be the client he might be on

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
the web client or he might be on

142
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
something that's just not quite

143
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
responding properly and i don't know

144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,240
where that reverb is coming from

145
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
um

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
we have somebody else

147
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,800
um

148
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,800
i'm ruth how are you doing

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,599
no living leaving disappeared

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
yeah

151
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,360
we're we're we're

152
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,039
we're not pleasant enough

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
i think sometimes

154
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,000
when people pop in and there's only the

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
two of us here because we're talking

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
about what's happening in the breakout

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,479
rooms and yeah they think they're alone

158
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,919
and they get together and they leave

159
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
they're like is it just me

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,599
no it's definitely not just just you

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
um oh i forgot to put a timer on

162
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,720
because i was dealing with hands so i'm

163
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
gonna add

164
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
uh probably four minutes they've had

165
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,919
three five six seven probably had about

166
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,319
three minutes what do you think anna

167
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,720
i would say four yeah

168
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599
yeah yeah so i've added four to timer

169
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
that's

170
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,680
what they've got left

171
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,919
room one has finished three questions

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,159
so that makes sense

173
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,839
room two is not going in

174
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,839
order but that's okay

175
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,360
they don't like the order then yeah they

176
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,399
just don't like the order

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,399
that is fair

178
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
so i guess we're looking for differences

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
here between

180
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,920
rooms well yeah what what what other

181
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,920
contentious issues if everybody agrees

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
but

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,040
data scrum is a time for the developers

184
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,560
to provide a status update crosses

185
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,120
as soon as you hear the word status

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,120
there's always a cross in there

187
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,519
uh held at the same time in same place

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,680
same time in same place i'm not sure it

189
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
says that in the scrum guide

190
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,600
anymore

191
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,680
i think it used to say that

192
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
but i think it just says

193
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
they might not even see anything anymore

194
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,360
are you having a look

195
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
yeah i think it says something but not

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,480
as specific as before i believe

197
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
i'm going to check

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
i

199
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
quite frequently check the scrum guide

200
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
it doesn't mean that i'm going to do

201
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,399
what it says

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,160
but i want to know whether i'm i'm

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,959
saying the right thing sometimes

204
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,519
yeah to reduce complexity it is held at

205
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,720
the same time and same same place every

206
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,120
working day of the sprint okay well

207
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,079
there we go it does still say that

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,079
yeah

209
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,079
yeah it's just to reduce complexity

210
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
so i i

211
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah

212
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,240
that's okay

213
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
we can have a debate about that also

214
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,760
well i think everybody agreed that same

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,800
time and same place is a good idea but

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
then

217
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,959
unfortunately nobody uh uh uh

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
agreed

219
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,800
well maybe they did scrum master is not

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,720
required to attend the daily scrum

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,399
and we get two green ticks

222
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
for not required

223
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
that's good

224
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,760
i don't i don't see any inconsistencies

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
there with the scrum guide but there's

226
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,279
definitely a little bit of confusion

227
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,160
about the scrum master helps

228
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
the developers keep the daily scrum

229
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
short

230
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,200
i think they are copying each other

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,880
because it's the only one that

232
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
well maybe they're just they're just

233
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
smart people who are picking the same

234
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
answers that could be it

235
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
yeah yeah

236
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
um

237
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
i'm just looking in the scrum guide see

238
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
if there's anything to do with

239
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,240
scrum master

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
helping the developers keep it short i'm

241
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,120
actually just gonna search

242
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
for the word short

243
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,980
not because

244
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
well for

245
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,480
[Music]

246
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
shorter sure

247
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
shorter shorter

248
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
no

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
i don't see anything about the scrub

250
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,160
master helping them keep it short

251
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,279
but keep to the time there we go and

252
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,279
keep within the time box

253
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,600
are you at somebody's birthday party

254
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,000
uh yesterday was my my older doctors of

255
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
birthday

256
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,399
i can i can i can see that oh

257
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,440
welcome back i think uh uh sean and

258
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,560
erica scared peter off

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
i think that's what happened

260
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,480
let's hope not

261
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
how did you get on frank

262
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,519
well we agreed

263
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
i i see that there seems to be a lot of

264
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,880
agreement here yeah yeah well there was

265
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
one there was one would help

266
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,120
which was of course a uh topic for

267
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
discussion the scrum master helping

268
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
the team uh or the developers keeping

269
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
the uh

270
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,839
what what did it say what was the

271
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,079
phrasing yep

272
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,650
i'm sorry oh yeah yeah

273
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,360
either help or coach or

274
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,839
[Music]

275
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,279
isn't coaching a form of helping i guess

276
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,240
that would be my

277
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
yeah

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
yeah

279
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,600
i i yeah we could definitely debate the

280
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,600
term help

281
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,680
yeah i mean it

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
i would say in general if i'm working

283
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,040
with a team that would be a pedantic

284
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,160
thing to bring up

285
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
but in

286
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
in this

287
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
case where we're all

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
uh um

289
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,199
practitioners right we can have we can

290
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,199
have those debate debates but i think it

291
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,040
it definitely comes across as a little

292
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
bit petty if we try and have those

293
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,320
debates in front of teams

294
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
and they

295
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
they start to talk about us as religious

296
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
zealots

297
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,720
rather than as uh coaches but yeah

298
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,839
um so i saw room one

299
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,600
um which was frank christian anna it was

300
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
only one there was one question that was

301
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,959
the question you didn't seem to answer

302
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,480
or you put the cross on top of the tick

303
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,480
was there a reason for that

304
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,399
christian

305
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
yeah i mean um

306
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,240
as we said

307
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,000
i don't think anyone would mind if scrub

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
master you know started helping a

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
developer daily scrub short

310
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,360
if they

311
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
noticed that it was like an hour every

312
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
day

313
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,760
oh but just as a blanket statement it's

314
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,959
uh yeah we were like uh

315
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,079
unsure

316
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,639
about it

317
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,959
yeah and i think i think it it

318
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,839
it's good to keep it short but i i

319
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
wouldn't really be

320
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,480
um

321
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,519
i wouldn't i don't think i would be

322
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,760
worried

323
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,760
if

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
it was taking it was taking longer

325
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,639
than 15 minutes i'm going to talk about

326
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,920
15 minutes for a daily scrum

327
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,320
this is this was the conversation that

328
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,079
anna and i had earlier as well

329
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
right there might be more things that we

330
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,079
need to talk about

331
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,839
and that's okay and i think it's always

332
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,680
been very explicit

333
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,839
in the scrum guide that it's not a

334
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
problem

335
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,399
solving event

336
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079
it you might if you identify a problem

337
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,240
and you're like we need to have a chat

338
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,399
about something else after the daily

339
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
scrum you can end the daily scrum and

340
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,199
immediately have the same group of

341
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
people having a conversation about this

342
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,920
other thing that you need to talk about

343
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
that's okay

344
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,759
right because how much planning should

345
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
we do

346
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,279
enough right as much as you need and no

347
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,920
more so we need to

348
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,480
uh we need to figure that out as we go

349
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,519
yeah right now in how we are working

350
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,480
that we're all working remotely like uh

351
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,079
having those time books so as strict

352
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
even though the scrum master need to

353
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,639
keep an eye on the and and keep those

354
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,160
time boxes um

355
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,800
uh we're working not collocated so

356
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,360
that also brings a little bit of

357
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,560
friction uh by not being able to

358
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,040
communicate

359
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,959
uh all you need are trying to be so fast

360
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
and sometimes that's the reason it

361
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,639
becomes a status meeting

362
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,040
so

363
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,639
man that's what i'm inclined to do is

364
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
set up a 15-minute meeting and then

365
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
immediately afterwards set up another

366
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,279
separate 15-minute meeting

367
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,920
uh with the expectation that you don't

368
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,799
the follow-up meeting is the breakout

369
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,360
because i got fed up with people

370
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,439
in scrum these things saying that martin

371
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,880
i must talk to you about x i'm gonna

372
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,120
have i've got a meeting i've got meeting

373
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,000
after this and two business

374
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,120
um

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
and just in the ideal world never use it

376
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,799
um

377
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,319
but then no one has got an excuse to go

378
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,480
i'm sorry i got meeting after this yeah

379
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
yeah

380
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,039
yeah and that that that's something that

381
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,000
that does quite often

382
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
happen

383
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,840
is that um oh i i i couldn't i couldn't

384
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,559
come to the daily scrum today because

385
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,799
i had this customer meeting

386
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,120
right and i i'm probably on the same

387
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
page as back here i would say well well

388
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
no

389
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,960
you have a customer meeting either

390
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,559
15 minutes later right

391
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,880
what's the big deal for the customer for

392
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,039
15 minutes but you then get to be part

393
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,760
of the daily scrum you're aware of the

394
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,440
context you're part of creating that

395
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
plan

396
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,919
that we need

397
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,679
so

398
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,240
not being involved in that context is

399
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,240
very difficult

400
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,280
um and that's that's something that i

401
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,160
think i've told peter before um maybe

402
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,720
anna

403
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,480
but i i i worked in a scrum team in

404
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
australia

405
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,480
from scotland it was awesome fun

406
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,679
um my my uh boss at the time adam cogan

407
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,679
um he'd set it up as an experiment for

408
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,760
how messed up could we make a team and

409
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,039
still be successful was his his

410
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
experiment

411
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,080
um so i had me in scotland

412
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
uh we had two people three people in

413
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,480
beijing

414
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,480
and two people in sydney australia

415
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,760
so the time zone shift i mean there was

416
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,880
there was eight six hours between me and

417
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,559
beijing

418
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,559
and then another four hours between

419
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,919
beijing and

420
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,400
and sydney

421
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,280
right so it's a massive massive time

422
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,240
shift

423
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,240
so i i had to get up at uh six o'clock

424
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,559
in the morning to do my daily scrum

425
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
which was evening for everybody else

426
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
right this the australians were just

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
about to go home

428
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,360
and then i would go back to bed

429
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,919
right because it's like six a.m

430
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
but one of the difficulties that we had

431
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,760
was what happens if you're in the

432
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
situation this was a consulting

433
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,160
organization you get pulled off that

434
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,240
project to go work for a customer for a

435
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
little bit

436
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
what happens when you come back to your

437
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
team

438
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
well now now am i going to be disruptive

439
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,320
by turning up and going hey guys what's

440
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
going on

441
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,120
right what are we working on today what

442
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
are you working on can i help you with

443
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,559
something oh really we're working on it

444
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
like that why can we have a conversation

445
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,000
about this architecture that you've

446
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
already had but i wasn't involved in so

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
i want my input to and now i'm being

448
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
disruptive

449
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,760
to the team so we actually had a rule

450
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,760
that if you get pulled off and you have

451
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
to come back you have to ask

452
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,080
to rejoin the team

453
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,280
and the team might say you can rejoin at

454
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
the next

455
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,880
review in retrospective you know come

456
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,640
for the review stay for the

457
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
retrospective stay for the next sprint

458
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
planning and then you rejoin the team

459
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
that way

460
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
because then you're less disruptive

461
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
because you're involved in the context

462
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,039
then um or

463
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,840
maybe i was away for short enough time

464
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,640
that i could just slide into the team

465
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,159
or maybe frank the team has decided that

466
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
they were more effective without me

467
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,320
uh i don't know that i don't know i'm

468
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
not actually they'd probably

469
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,559
message you at some point and say yes we

470
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
agreed martin was not not useful for the

471
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,280
team

472
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,720
but i know that did happen

473
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,559
um

474
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,640
but i don't remember whether it was me

475
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,559
that's maybe my faulty memory my wife

476
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
says i have the same faulty memory if

477
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,520
it's something negative then you delete

478
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,039
it from your brain

479
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
but it definitely happened and it's

480
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,440
perfectly reasonable right there's not a

481
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,159
negative thing in that there's

482
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,320
not everybody is great at working with

483
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,080
every group of people

484
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
right there are there are people that i

485
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,280
have worked with in the past that i wish

486
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,720
i had the choice not to work with them

487
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,159
in the past no not you peter wasn't you

488
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,799
it wasn't you peter

489
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,960
uh peter and i worked on a a

490
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,840
an engagement previously in a big

491
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
consulting company it was a lot of

492
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,120
fun you have a great yes with uh we've

493
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
had with a little bit of history

494
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,080
um

495
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
but it's it's it's it's one of those

496
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,039
things that you know not everybody's

497
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,080
compatible and that needs to be okay

498
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,080
because we're all humans

499
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,679
yeah so

500
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,480
will we i think we'll we'll uh jump

501
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,799
straight into this why is your daily

502
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,520
scrum ineffective we're going to use the

503
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,039
output a little bit later or at least i

504
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,760
hope we are

505
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,120
um

506
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,000
peter knows about my timing uh problems

507
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
uh

508
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
so

509
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
i'd like to do a little a little one two

510
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
four all

511
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,320
for this so i'm going to give you at one

512
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,799
minute on your own to answer the

513
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,799
question

514
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,559
what are all of the activities

515
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,840
that make your daily scrum ineffective

516
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,200
what makes your daily scrum

517
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,600
ineffective okay so i'm going to put one

518
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,840
minute timer on

519
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,520
for you to silently and on your own

520
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
come up with a list of things feel free

521
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
to add them to the mural if if you want

522
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,960
rather than writing them down i'm okay

523
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,440
with it with both

524
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,640
um and i will create some rooms with

525
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,320
pairs

526
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,159
how many how many people do we have now

527
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
anna

528
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
oh

529
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
we have nine

530
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,600
nine

531
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,400
so that's four four breakout rooms

532
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
no

533
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
yes

534
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,960
four breakout rooms but then i'll have

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
to do something

536
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,640
because there's no pinning i can't

537
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,200
exclude somebody from the random

538
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,600
breakout room generation

539
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,400
so now i have to go oh perfect i like it

540
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
when it puts you in a

541
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
room with

542
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,280
two other people and then i don't have

543
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,200
to go

544
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,200
rearrange a bunch of stuff there we go

545
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,000
so we're going to do a little uh

546
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,480
we're going to do two minutes in pairs

547
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,080
and then roll straight into four minutes

548
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,440
in two pairs

549
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
and what i'd like you to do in each

550
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,200
group is when you go into your pairs

551
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,120
take your lists that you just created

552
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,520
and merge them together

553
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,960
so you end up with one list

554
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,120
and then when you go into the room with

555
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,080
your with two pairs

556
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,159
right you'll be bringing two lists again

557
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,200
two merged lists merge them together

558
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,279
again so we have one list since there's

559
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,520
four rooms we should end up with two

560
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,200
lists at the end and then we come back

561
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,320
to the main room we can merge them

562
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,440
together again okay

563
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,440
uh perfect so i'm gonna click uh open if

564
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
everybody's on the mural i'll summon to

565
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
that spot

566
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,880
for the exercise where you can put these

567
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,760
things in

568
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,760
what makes your daily scrum ineffective

569
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,360
i'm going to change that from activities

570
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
to things all of the

571
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,320
things

572
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,320
that make your daily strum ineffective

573
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,880
oh maybe

574
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,720
they can be

575
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,720
oh yeah

576
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,440
oh it's still still opening

577
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
totally totally off into the room

578
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,320
yeah

579
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
this is this is where this is the bit

580
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,840
that actually sucks when you're doing a

581
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
public

582
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,679
one

583
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,360
because if if one person leaves at this

584
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,720
point

585
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
yeah it breaks the road it breaks the

586
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,559
rooms because somebody's in a room on

587
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,480
their own when you do pairs and so what

588
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,880
what i did for a while at the start of

589
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,200
doing these exercises was um there's a

590
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,200
way in teams to lock the meeting

591
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,840
i i don't know where it is now there's a

592
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
meeting option to to stop more people

593
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,400
coming in

594
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,440
um and that way you at least

595
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,799
stop people hopping in and hopping out

596
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
yeah

597
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,159
but we

598
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,440
you cannot um

599
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,760
um

600
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,919
not avoid people let people live in you

601
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,720
can't avoid people leaving no but you

602
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,720
can avoid people popping in for 30

603
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
seconds and then disappearing again just

604
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,799
as you're creating the rooms

605
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
but that was really bad when we when we

606
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,360
did the first couple of sessions

607
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,279
um but we did everything people signed

608
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,480
up directly in teams

609
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,720
now with the see i think tolu's

610
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,559
not managed to either make it into the

611
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
room or he's gone off to do something

612
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,520
else

613
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,960
but luckily he ended up in a room of

614
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,960
peter and anna as well so

615
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,960
oh i'm going to put that one minute

616
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,679
i'm too busy talking to you anna i

617
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
forgot about the timer

618
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,240
when you asked about the number i was

619
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,640
sharing the link in linkedin so

620
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,840
it happened the same

621
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,240
four to one

622
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,440
three to two

623
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,559
three to

624
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,960
two

625
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,960
and i don't think i can do anything

626
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
about

627
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,279
tolu i'm going to put him unassigned

628
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,480
so i have a big box in front of front of

629
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,600
your face at the moment anna because

630
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
i've got the

631
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,520
reassigned participants window up and i

632
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,120
can't move it because it's a model

633
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,120
dialog box

634
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,640
and some ridiculous

635
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,880
uh um

636
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,799
ux design there

637
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,039
we've seen each other a lot today so no

638
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
problem yeah

639
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,240
we spent about three hours

640
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,520
putting this workshop together this

641
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,760
morning so

642
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,919
i think that's uh

643
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,640
what what you need is a box for my face

644
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
right that's why

645
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,919
so

646
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,919
time's up hit the submit button

647
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,919
i i try and remember to preset up the

648
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,520
move

649
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,159
and then you just hit the submit button

650
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,440
but again if somebody leaves halfway

651
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,200
then when you hit the submit button

652
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
teams goes i couldn't move people and

653
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,399
then you have to go move each person

654
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
manually that's that that's a pain in

655
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,440
the butt oh but this has worked nicely

656
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,080
this has worked nicely

657
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,840
i i see there is uh there is people that

658
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,760
uh james uh

659
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,399
uh this reworked such

660
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,279
regularly like yeah like anna or peter

661
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,720
yeah p p peter comes really often anna

662
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,799
comes often

663
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,120
julong i think it's been to everyone

664
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,640
erica came to one and then she's been at

665
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,279
everyone since

666
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,080
um and christian was in my class last

667
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
week

668
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,919
so

669
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,520
uh uh he's coming along to see to see

670
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,000
what what what it's all about i guess

671
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,120
what we're what we're talking about

672
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,120
um

673
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,799
but he's he's quite an experienced scrum

674
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,640
master he brought

675
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,360
um

676
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,360
to

677
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,320
he brought his ceo

678
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,799
and his product owner to the pspo

679
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,840
um last week which was a lot of fun was

680
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,880
it last week

681
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,039
i think it was last yes it was last week

682
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,360
it all melts together sometimes

683
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,120
you had a busy last week

684
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,200
last week wasn't so bad because i had a

685
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,200
product owner in the morning and the psm

686
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,880
in the afternoon was cancelled

687
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,559
so i had half days

688
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,440
but then i ended up having lots of

689
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,600
little bits of things

690
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
but half days are good for

691
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,159
handling those little bits of things

692
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,080
that you don't normally get to handle

693
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,520
the training's the value

694
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,520
and then there's all the other stuff to

695
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,279
do with the focus not to do with

696
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,200
directly to do with the goal that week

697
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,200
needs to be done they need to be done

698
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,240
right you need to do that you need to do

699
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,679
the customer calls uh you need to do the

700
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,440
because i do a lot of um um 30-minute

701
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,440
training reviews

702
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,640
i like assessment reviews

703
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,360
and then

704
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,240
sometimes people just want to chat

705
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,919
so i get coffees on my schedule

706
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,159
and all kinds of things i actually

707
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,640
missed one earlier i had somebody i

708
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,799
wanted to to meet up with

709
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,559
um earlier but i went out

710
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
to get lunch just before and ended up

711
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,240
stuck in traffic and i didn't make it

712
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,159
back in time to

713
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,679
jump on that call swipe the message can

714
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,760
we do tomorrow

715
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,679
so

716
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,399
so then a lot of people

717
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,440
uh

718
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,399
book those uh 30 minutes coffee

719
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,520
um i have it limited to to one coffee

720
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,000
per day

721
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,520
and one so there's a bunch of different

722
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
types of sessions

723
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,360
um because i've also got the the if you

724
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,120
take a if you take a training class i do

725
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,679
the one-on-one

726
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,320
on hours consulting basically

727
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
um so sometimes people book that as well

728
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,960
and i limit that to one per day so i

729
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,640
don't fill up my whole day with

730
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
lots of those things

731
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,240
um but it means i have to i actually

732
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,159
have to book all of the training off of

733
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,760
my calendar all the way into the future

734
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,039
at least three weeks into the future so

735
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,640
that

736
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,919
they don't take book over that time

737
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,799
there is one minute fourteen left

738
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,080
there's one big list in one tiny list

739
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,039
yeah i i was uh i was uh chicken with

740
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,600
what they

741
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,600
what they are writing

742
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,120
wow somebody's put taylorism on the big

743
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
list that must be the groom that peter's

744
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,200
in

745
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
oh well actually

746
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,520
i guess it could be christian or erica

747
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,039
as well as peter anna

748
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,000
or even gee long i guess it could be

749
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,120
anybody

750
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,880
so

751
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,000
multitasking

752
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
people talking too much

753
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,840
yes we have that problem

754
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
uh taylorism

755
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,120
waiting their turn only

756
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,080
people are not there to listen too much

757
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,320
focus on what i did yesterday

758
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,640
solutioning

759
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,880
no coherent sprint goal

760
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,600
that's definitely impediment

761
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,159
shared ownership too many people

762
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,039
no no coherent team

763
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,039
that sounds harsh

764
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,880
where are we for time it's just 10

765
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,200
seconds left i'm gonna click the close

766
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,279
button at like five seconds cuz

767
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,840
there's a delay

768
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
there we go

769
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,679
i always feel like there's less of a

770
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,679
daily for people coming back but

771
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,679
hey guys

772
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,559
hey

773
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,600
hey jovan geelong

774
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,480
christian peter frank

775
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,559
everybody's back awesome

776
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,320
so we had quite a lot of uh things on

777
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,360
that top list there but not so many

778
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
things on the bottom list

779
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,000
we didn't get to the filtering uh

780
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,159
we were asking ourselves well it's a one

781
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,880
two four also do we have to you know put

782
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,120
things together and eliminate

783
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,200
uh stuff here for now

784
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,320
so we get to the elimination

785
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,640
well we is that at the top or the bottom

786
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,679
the top at the top okay

787
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
uh

788
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,000
oh cool so room two was at the top we'll

789
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,120
get multitasking taylorism

790
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,159
wait waiting their turn only

791
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,760
is that

792
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
what what what's that

793
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,679
that's christian i think

794
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,640
yeah it means having the mentality of

795
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,640
just

796
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,240
i'm just showing up i'm waiting my turn

797
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
i'm going to speak and uh you know

798
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,279
you're disengaged the whole time all the

799
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,360
time

800
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,039
maybe even maybe even disengage while

801
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,919
you're speaking yourself

802
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,200
you know

803
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,039
i've heard that

804
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,279
yeah not not actually listening when

805
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,120
you're speaking yourself yeah

806
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,440
just reading the name of the card you

807
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,039
know whatever yeah

808
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,360
yeah too much focus on what i did

809
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,720
yesterday

810
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,679

there was just a weird fuzzy

823
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,039
i believe

824
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,600

825
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,440

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,039
i put a long list which i just assembled

833
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,039

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,560
these peter

837
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,399
i have been wondering

838
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,480
going into the details

839
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,359
recap all of the meetings from the

840
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,200
previous day your team's too big that

841
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,399
can be an impediment

842
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,200
can't it

843
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,720
i'm sorry i was about to drop this

844
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,159
there's mouse moving around so he's

845
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,919
definitely there

846
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,639
yeah i am i just want to

847
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,000
add a sticky right

848
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,000
oh so if you

849
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
if you just click in us in a space

850
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,679
there you go

851
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,079
that's the magic way

852
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,760
yeah deep diving too much too much

853
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,720
chitty chat oh it sounds like we've got

854
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,720
some dips people talking too much

855
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,720
oh where's the chitty chat one

856
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,079
too much chitty chat

857
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,760
um

858
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,240
deep dive

859
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,240
sounds like solutioning

860
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,599
um what i'm gonna make your yours a

861
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,280
little bit bigger

862
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,720
there peter they're very small

863
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,040
not start oh

864
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,599
i removed you from the chat apparently

865
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,200
we'll just delete that one

866
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,800
you got all the power

867
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
i tried to remove them but it didn't

868
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,119
work he's still here

869
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,839
uh people on multiple projects arriving

870
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,839
late

871
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,680
and leaving early

872
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,280
yeah that's that that meeting block that

873
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,440
we're talking about not engaging

874
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,200
lack of energy

875
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,880
i've seen if there's well there's

876
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,520
there's too many people

877
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,560
with too big

878
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,599
right

879
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,359
people are multiple projects

880
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,400
tech lead

881
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,000
tech team lead as for update meeting

882
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,440
hijacking the meeting for a status

883
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,560
meeting for the team lead is that what

884
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,560
that is peter yeah the uh ask mr k off

885
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,920
uh not sharing no trust not focusing on

886
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,920
value

887
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,680
traders update on a plan

888
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
right these are these are a lot of

889
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,760
things that

890
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,520
i know anna and i see as problems in

891
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,560
team after team after team they're not

892
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,760
uncommon problems to to have having all

893
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,880
of them in one team would be a bit scary

894
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,640
um

895
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
but they're all uh

896
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,920
reasonable things

897
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,680
that we see that contribute to the

898
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,280
ineffectiveness

899
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,160
of teams

900
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,359
anna would you like to introduce

901
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,760
uh this exercise the card sort

902
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,359
while i um

903
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,119
put the cards in the right place for us

904
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,119
yeah

905
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,000
um

906
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,160
so right now what uh martin is doing we

907
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,760
have uh some cards

908
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,119
uh and we want you to sort them uh based

909
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,839
on um

910
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,400
if

911
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,160
those cards belong to the purpose of the

912
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,760
daily scrum

913
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,880
or they do not belong to to its purpose

914
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,800
okay

915
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,359
and

916
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,760
how are uh martin are we going to

917
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,920
make group make groups two groups or

918
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,320
three groups what number of groups are

919
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
we going i was i was thinking that we

920
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,560
should do

921
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,480
three groups and one of us should

922
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,680
participate in a group to make it up to

923
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,280
three

924
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,359
because we all know two people is a

925
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,280
conversation three people's an argument

926
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,440
and we want people to have have some

927
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,800
some some arguments

928
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,960
um so if i do three rooms but just let

929
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,760
let you fall into our room as well

930
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,680
yeah

931
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,040
then we can do that so i've added i've

932
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,000
added the the

933
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,880
the three layouts to the room so you've

934
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,040
got

935
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,160
um this is about the scrum so we've got

936
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,359
purpose and not the purpose

937
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,839
columns

938
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,359
um and a bunch of cards and some of them

939
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,800
go under purpose and some of them wonder

940
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,079
not the purpose

941
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,520
okay it's pretty much that

942
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,640
straightforward so it's sorting the

943
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
cards

944
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,240
into those columns let me just quickly

945
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,960
lock the

946
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,880
background there

947
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,839
because otherwise that will be nasty the

948
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,560

to leave you in the room for an extra

969
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,359
two minutes uh but i'll uncover the

970
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,680
answers

971
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,079
on the right there so you can then go ch

972
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,280
what i guess what we intended to go in

973
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,640
which uh which room okay and which

974
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,200
column

975
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,920
so i've clicked to open it i'll uh pop

976
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,200
into room one and help them out you're

977
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,640
in room two

978
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,119
anna

979
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,079
okay so people on the stream won't see

980
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,400
anything

981
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,079
uh no they will they will follow me

982
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,240
okay they'll follow me because i'm the

983
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,240
host so that's uh that's okay

984
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,599
there we go everybody's in the

985
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,040
off they go and then i'll i'll join room

986
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,040
one so you might see a little flicker

987
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,830
who has control over um mario i'm gonna

988
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,900
sell

989
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,900
[Music]

990
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,800
so eliminate the me the need for other

991
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,319
meetings i would say that's not the

992
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,680
purpose

993
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,240
correct

994
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,000
and then focuses on this progress toward

995
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,400
the sprint goal i would say that's a

996
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
purpose

997
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,119
decision making also

998
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,319
help

999
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,280
check for blockers yeah yeah

1000
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,040
all right

1001
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,200
review the status of each

1002
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,240
of each of ongoing tasks i don't think

1003
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,880
so it's not the purpose yeah to the

1004
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,760
right who else is with us so

1005
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,680
peter and martin and

1006
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,520
and christian christian i'm here i'm

1007
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,280
just finishing up a burger yeah

1008
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,960
i'll start i'll start the argument if

1009
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,040
not martin i'm not gonna solve the

1010
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,280
subject just for fun yeah and that

1011
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,280
pulled out the update status to the

1012
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,839
right

1013
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,400
where is it update status oh yeah update

1014
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,640
the status no oh sorry

1015
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,960
yeah no they create focus and improve

1016
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,000
sales management i would say so

1017
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,800
yeah

1018
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,359
actual plan for the next day this could

1019
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,160
be a game play so it's for the current

1020
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,760
day yeah so

1021
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,280
and then review what was accomplished

1022
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,040
yesterday check the progression of the

1023
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,480
sprint goal i would say purpose correct

1024
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,480
i missed what was the last one

1025
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,850
[Music]

1026
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,440
i do think that is the purpose or like

1027
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,720
at least part of the purpose of the data

1028
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,079
scrub

1029
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,760
is you getting everyone together you're

1030
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,000
making a plan and then hopefully you

1031
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,480
don't have to have a lot of other

1032
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,119
regular meetings

1033
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,800
okay i would argue about two two things

1034
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,200
i'd argue about and one of those i have

1035
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,240
to ask martin the question um

1036
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,359
martin when you said the next day

1037
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,359
did did you mean the 24-hour period from

1038
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,720
this moment forward what did you mean

1039
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,280
the

1040
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,960
because i i assume that you i assume i

1041
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,960
would have read that as the next day

1042
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,960
meaning from the current day

1043
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,040
yeah so i would i would read that as if

1044
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,680
we did it at

1045
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,839
8 45 in the morning

1046
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,359
the next day is today

1047
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,520
we're the rest of today the rest the

1048
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,160
rest the day the day because but we

1049
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,960
might have our daily scrum

1050
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,640
at 4 45 o'clock yeah we might have a 4

1051
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,920
45 peter we don't want to keep people

1052
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,960
after five

1053
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,640
um

1054
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,560
so we have four

1055
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,400
four five 5 45

1056
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,880
and then they're planning

1057
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,720
the next day so i think

1058
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
and if you did it at lunch time

1059
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,160
maybe it would be

1060
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
the next day would be until the next

1061
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,720
daily

1062
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,359
yeah

1063
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,280
24 hours does make sense but it's not

1064
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,800
phrased that way anywhere anywhere i've

1065
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,560
seen it

1066
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,599
and then

1067
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,200
so

1068
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,319
i think that was a clarification of

1069
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,280
titles

1070
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,280
and then my question was

1071
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,480
and then

1072
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,640
i i don't think it's about reviewing the

1073
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,680
accomplishments

1074
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,440
you know

1075
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,880
yeah well

1076
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,960
you know where do you come from where do

1077
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,280
you go

1078
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
uh

1079
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,440
i suppose

1080
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,040
i would argue that there's a moment of

1081
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,119
trust that when martin said that he was

1082
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,880
going to sort out our devops problem and

1083
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,480
get us access to the non-production

1084
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,800
environment

1085
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,400
but yeah yesterday i'll stand up and

1086
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,599
then today when anytime he's going to do

1087
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,119
something else

1088
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,800
i trust martin i know that he's

1089
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,280
accomplished that if i really care i go

1090
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,280
look it up

1091
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,160
so okay

1092
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,200
he doesn't need to tell me he's done

1093
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,079
that now here's the word review review

1094
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,079
that's the wrong word

1095
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,839
it's not about reviewing indeed

1096
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,240
so

1097
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,839
now if if you know

1098
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,520
someone in the security police had

1099
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,119
stopped in accomplishing what we wanted

1100
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,720
to get done then i would expect him to

1101
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,319
say

1102
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,319
um didn't do x

1103
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,839
i'm going to get that down today or

1104
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,760
i can't do it we'll just push it into

1105
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,119
next week which isn't she's really just

1106
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,400
talking about blockers and things it's

1107
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,000
not not a review per se would be my my

1108
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,079
opinion there

1109
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,119
i i think i agree

1110
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,119
so that would mean this

1111
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,520
right

1112
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,400
it'll be my view

1113
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
yeah

1114
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,640
and i think what christian said

1115
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,560
eliminate the need for other meetings i

1116
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,960
what i my problem i have a problem with

1117
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,800
the word eliminate

1118
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,720
i think even in the scrum guide it says

1119
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,599
something like that you know developers

1120
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,359
will meet whenever it's necessary but at

1121
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,599
least you have one

1122
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,760
or something to that end

1123
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,920
it's not its primary purpose if it

1124
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,440
accomplishes that then that's great

1125
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,599
we've got a side effect

1126
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,800
yeah yeah we've got a byproduct it's

1127
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,680
perfect to know what we're doing in the

1128
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
next 24 hours

1129
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,839
i am going to open out the answers

1130
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,839
over here

1131
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,720
um and i'll just try and bring a copy of

1132
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,960
the answers across for you because that

1133
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,960
will

1134
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,839
because chris christian is correct

1135
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,839
on his

1136
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,359
okay

1137
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,920
so that one eliminates the need for

1138
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,640
other meetings is a direct quote from

1139
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,640
the scrum guide

1140
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,319
so

1141
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:42,640
in the scrum guide it says daily scrum

1142
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,119
improve daily scrums improve

1143
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,920
communications identify impediments

1144
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,079
promote quick decision making and

1145
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,800
consequently eliminate the need for

1146
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,800
other meetings

1147
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,160
okay there you go there you go

1148
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,079
all right and then you've given all of

1149
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,720
the meetings

1150
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,240
yeah it doesn't save all other meetings

1151
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,920
right there's still going to be other

1152
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,760
things we still have to meet with the

1153
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,839
customer we still have to

1154
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,000
you know

1155
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,359
do refinement we still need to do all of

1156
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
those things but we want to minimize

1157
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,000
the the the number of other meetings

1158
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,560
um so there's one

1159
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,240
extra one you've oh i should

1160
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,240
that's my uh bad let me

1161
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,079
there we go

1162
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,000
um

1163
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,920
so which is the one that you've got on

1164
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
the left so the one

1165
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,359
that you had incorrect on the right hand

1166
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
side was eliminate the need for other

1167
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,760
meetings

1168
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,640
right that one there's one on the left

1169
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,640
that shouldn't be there

1170
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,280
promotes quick decision making creates

1171
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,520
focus improves it checks up there we go

1172
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,599
yep

1173
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,160
checks if we have individual or team

1174
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,160
blockers

1175
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,319
is uh definitely not the purpose

1176
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,599
all right so i'm just going to go back

1177
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,160
to the main room and then call everybody

1178
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,160
back okay

1179
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,599
i

1180
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,200
oh these were getting better i had an

1181
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,960
audio failure there i had a little

1182
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,319
geelong are you still with us

1183
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,880

1185
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,359
it's so such a nice workshop i don't

1186
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,800
want to leave you know so i have no

1187
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,480
choice

1188
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,760
anna and i spent three hours on it this

1189
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,760
morning so

1190
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,760
um

1191
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,839
yeah so 12 30 to 12 o'clock normally i

1192
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,319
have the meeting between one two and

1193
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,720
afternoon before it was okay right now

1194
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,480
now yeah you'll have you'll have to move

1195
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,720
that other meeting

1196
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,720
that's

1197
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,319
um

1198
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,440
so my in in in my room anna we had we

1199
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,200
had two

1200
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,520
ended up in the wrong place which was

1201
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,640
eliminate the need for other meetings

1202
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,599
ended up on not the purpose and check if

1203
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,599
we have

1204
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,280
individual or team blockers ended up on

1205
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,880
purpose

1206
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,160
yeah in in

1207
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,200
in my room the same about the blockers

1208
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,160
uh ended up in purpose and also

1209
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,480
um

1210
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,079
review what was accomplished yesterday

1211
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,079
and check the progress of the

1212
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,240
springboard those two

1213
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,960
yeah because that that that um those

1214
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,960
three questions that used to be so

1215
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,559
prevalent in the daily scrum what did we

1216
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,839
do yesterday

1217
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,200
what are we doing today and what's

1218
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,920
blocking us

1219
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,880
is the reason for those two things

1220
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,640
but

1221
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,760
those questions

1222
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,280
were only ever defined

1223
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,520
as a complementary practice to help us

1224
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,280
get to the outcome that we want which is

1225
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,800
re-planning the next

1226
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,040
day's work

1227
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,800
yeah and sometimes answering those

1228
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,760
questions ended up in a status report

1229
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,960
yeah

1230
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,640
and and and in fact i i would

1231
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,400
think i i would

1232
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,359
i would put those questions what did i

1233
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,040
do yesterday what am i

1234
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,440
doing today

1235
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,559
what's blocking me

1236
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,920
doesn't sound like very team orientated

1237
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,280
questions or very goal orientated

1238
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,760
questions

1239
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,040
right so i i do

1240
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,839
very much prefer looking at the value

1241
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,520
in and saying here's a piece of value on

1242
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,280
the board

1243
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,119
is it progressing is it something we

1244
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,040
need to talk about and then all the

1245
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,440
people that are involved in delivering

1246
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,839
that value can can can talk about it

1247
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,760
together or maybe only one person talks

1248
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,119
because that's that's

1249
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,480
what makes sense for that moment in time

1250
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,119
right there's no requirement for

1251
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,119
everybody to speak in a daily scrum

1252
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,280
magic recipe for the

1253
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,280
for the daily scrum uh

1254
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,880
it can be very different from one day to

1255
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,680
another depending on what the team needs

1256
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,280
yep there's no formula

1257
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,480
that's going to apply to every daily

1258
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,400
scrum

1259
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,079
the thing that we're supposed to get out

1260
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,880
of it

1261
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,599
is a plan for the next 24 hours for the

1262
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,599
next day's work

1263
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,440
i think as soon as you the formula

1264
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,079
you remove the crutch and you make life

1265
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,400
harder you're suddenly saying to people

1266
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,839
plan some value for me well no no all i

1267
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,200
want to do is i did this yesterday i'm

1268
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,359
doing this today and i'm blocked by

1269
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,880
something that's i can walk away now

1270
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,280
where if you say

1271
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,400
plan me some value

1272
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,640
that's such a much harder question they

1273
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,800
have to think about it they have to look

1274
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,880
at what what's the things that we're

1275
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,040
doing how the impacting what we're

1276
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,200
trying to achieve

1277
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,920
and figure out what's the best next

1278
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,160
thing to do to get value moving across

1279
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
yeah you're right peter that's hard

1280
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,960
yeah you know peter you know what what

1281
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,280
i'm doing right now i'm i'm sending the

1282
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,359
uh in a team i'm sending people into

1283
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,559
breakup rooms to discuss

1284
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,800
um i'm not there and they discuss in

1285
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,839
between them and then they come back and

1286
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,839
they share

1287
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,559
so they are the one the ones that need

1288
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,400
to to build that plan and i'm not

1289
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,400
involved and they need to they don't

1290
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,200
need to report to anybody

1291
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,000
so

1292
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,920
i first it that way they analyze the

1293
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,720
data they have and

1294
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
they come back with with a plan

1295
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,760
so

1296
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,000
during the stand up

1297
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,000
you

1298
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,480
divide them in breakout rooms and then

1299
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,480
within say five minutes

1300
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,760
yeah they come back and they share their

1301
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,760
individual plan yeah and they um they uh

1302
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,720
then in the main room they come together

1303
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,680
uh to a plan they agree on a plan okay

1304
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,359
but does that mean that the breakout

1305
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,960
sessions or the breakout rooms also

1306
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,520
automatically lead to some kind of

1307
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,359
cooperation between those yeah yeah yeah

1308
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,000
exactly and

1309
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:30,240
it's like when when martin sent you into

1310
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,920
two four one oh yeah yeah it's the same

1311
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,400
yeah it's the same idea same same

1312
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,960
techniques but do you let them decide

1313
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,520
themselves no which breakout session

1314
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,640
they will join no it's uh i do it

1315
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,640
differently every every day

1316
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,400
so the the way the way i do it when i'm

1317
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,000
creating breakout rooms and it's

1318
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,680
actually the easiest way because the

1319
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,200
tools support it the best is you just

1320
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,800
create random rooms

1321
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,839
yeah so it doesn't really matter who's

1322
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,200
together

1323
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,800
right and that's actually kind of a good

1324
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,480
thing and it's kind of why i do random

1325
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,520
rooms for every different exercise as

1326
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,440
well so even if you did two rounds

1327
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,119
of those planning you put people with

1328
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,240
different groups of people so you get

1329
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,079
different ideas different pollination uh

1330
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,839
coming out of it each time

1331
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,599
um if you put the same people together

1332
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,160
all the time you'll get the same answer

1333
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,800
all the time yeah yeah

1334
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,800
and it's great having uh the designer of

1335
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,640
a team of the team with the backhander

1336
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,119
of the can

1337
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,079
decide and share so

1338
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,680
yeah

1339
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,920
having having cross-functional is is is

1340
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,200
but do they come up with a joint plan or

1341
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,359
a individual plans

1342
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,599
uh

1343
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,640
they come with with a dream plan about

1344
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,839
them well

1345
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,000
of course each one has to um uh do

1346
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,720
different things but they share it and

1347
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,960
they

1348
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,359
come to the main burn and share and for

1349
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,440
this move here zubachanderson they

1350
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,200
decide together so it's like

1351
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,760
it's it's an agreement with the team

1352
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,920
okay so

1353
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,599
so yeah the way the way i think about it

1354
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,480
is that you send them out to breakout

1355
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,720
rooms they each come up with their plan

1356
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,359
they bring it back to the main room and

1357
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,040
then you're joining those two plans

1358
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,119
right if you get two breakout rooms you

1359
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,680
join those two plans together but they

1360
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,319
might individually and separately come

1361
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,960
up with very different ideas

1362
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,480
about how we should proceed

1363
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,559
and you get them back together and one

1364
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,760
group's like oh yeah we never thought of

1365
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,440
that

1366
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,040
right and if we were just in the main

1367
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,480
room they might not have thought of that

1368
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,960
at all they might have only picked one

1369
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,280
way because maybe there's

1370
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,520
frank do you remember we talked about

1371
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,000
before we went um live we were talking

1372
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,000
about board games for a little bit yeah

1373
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,160
and we talked about pandemic

1374
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,799
yeah and you've got that that that hero

1375
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,240
that runs the story and tries to

1376
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,839
tell everybody i can't remember what

1377
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,319
it's called in gaming right there's a

1378
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,640
name for that type of person the alpha

1379
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,720
player who's trying to tell everybody

1380
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,799
else how to do the thing because they

1381
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,640
know best how to win

1382
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,520
right rather than letting people make

1383
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,920
their own decisions discover

1384
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,760
mistakes themselves and by doing

1385
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,720
breakout rooms

1386
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,000
you're effectively isolating that alpha

1387
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,599
player

1388
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,599
from the other room's discussions

1389
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,640
yeah

1390
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,000
i i think that's quite an interesting

1391
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,000
technique i mean

1392
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,920
i would say i'm dying to try it with uh

1393
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,920
with a live team but i do it all the

1394
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,240
time in in

1395
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,839
in courses with groups of

1396
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,240
people who are trying to solve solve

1397
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:39,040
problems and come up with idl

1398
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,040
very rarely

1399
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,520
do i do breakout rooms in a class giving

1400
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,280
everybody the same question and you get

1401
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,319
four rooms come back with exactly the

1402
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,359
same

1403
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,720
story

1404
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,880
right everybody comes up with different

1405
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,640
ways to solve the problem and it starts

1406
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,920
another discussion

1407
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,040
which is great

1408
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,839
uh

1409
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,599
i have a question regarding uh the one

1410
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,920
on purpose like review what was

1411
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,720
accomplished yesterday let's check the

1412
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,839
progression of the sprinting goal

1413
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,880
uh

1414
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:11,200
i doubted about that and said

1415
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,960
like for during the daily we could talk

1416
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,000
about the progression of the spreading

1417
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,440
goal

1418
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,160
if we are on track or not even we are

1419
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,880
building a plan we needed to uh make

1420
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,920
sure the line is on track towards the

1421
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,720
progression of the spreading goal right

1422
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,920
yeah and if it if if that card had just

1423
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,839
said uh review progress towards the

1424
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,680
sprint goal

1425
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,720
then then i would definitely have it on

1426
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,720
the left

1427
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,920
but review what was accomplished

1428
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,640
yesterday as the red herring

1429
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,559
right that's the bit that negates that

1430
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,799
that that that statement and puts it on

1431
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,559
the right

1432
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,160
it's not about

1433
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,240
i i don't really care what was

1434
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,240
accomplished yesterday

1435
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,200
are we currently and how do we move

1436
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,400
forward

1437
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,200
is the important discussion

1438
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,640
how do we plan what's next

1439
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,640
because remember

1440
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,680
so julian something something i think to

1441
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,640
remember is that um

1442
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,359
this is not the only time that the team

1443
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,720
ever talk to each other

1444
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:22,559
this is just the defined time for us to

1445
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,200
get together and re-plan what's next

1446
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,000
i would expect a professional team to be

1447
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,400
talking to each other constantly

1448
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,040
to be updating each other when they have

1449
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,799
problems and oh i'm stuck i'm going to

1450
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,680
involve some other team members and see

1451
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:40,240
if anybody can help um and and

1452
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,079
collaborate with them if i finish a task

1453
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,000
i'm not going to go pull something new

1454
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,680
first i'm going to see if anybody on my

1455
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,599
team needs some help

1456
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,599
right so if we're if we're working in

1457
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,319
that collaborative way

1458
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,240
then we should be able to keep the daily

1459
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,920
focused on the thing that we want which

1460
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,440
is what are we going to what's the most

1461
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,559
important thing for us to do over the

1462
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,160
next

1463
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,960
day's work

1464
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,920
to get towards our goal

1465
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,520
yeah

1466
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,920
i i think yeah i know that i know the

1467
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,760
the main point for this activity but

1468
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,280
personally i still uh

1469
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,839
feel the

1470
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,799
review what was coming yesterday

1471
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,880
and

1472
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,119
another one check if we have individual

1473
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,079
or team blockers these two

1474
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,280
are still something that we could uh

1475
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,839
bring up during the daily

1476
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,839
i think you can certainly bring it up

1477
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,839
yeah right we're definitely not saying

1478
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,559
don't bring it up

1479
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,760
but not the purpose does that make sense

1480
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,400
like if it helps if it serves the team

1481
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,240
to help us get to the purpose

1482
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,240
do it

1483
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,160
if you find that that stops working for

1484
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,319
you because what happens a lot is you do

1485
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,160
it the same all the time and then you

1486
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,480
become mechanical

1487
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,640
everybody's just answering the question

1488
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,160
like a robot so i can get back to work

1489
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,359
and not have to talk with anybody

1490
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,559
anymore

1491
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,839
right and i don't care what you're

1492
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,119
working on and i don't care what i'm

1493
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,119
working on either

1494
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,880
um so so

1495
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,280
keep changing it up keep doing it

1496
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,960
differently do breakout rooms if they

1497
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,280
make sense if you find people are being

1498
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,559
too mechanical switch it up instead of

1499
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,480
focusing on

1500
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,839
what did i do yesterday have a daily

1501
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,599
scrum we're gonna do something different

1502
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:24,960
today we're gonna look at the

1503
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,160
work item aging graph uh for our sprint

1504
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,720
and we're gonna we're gonna make some

1505
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,319
decisions based on that or we're bored

1506
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,200
with that we're gonna look at something

1507
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,720
else oh we missed some stuff maybe we

1508
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,000
should go back to look at that aging

1509
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,520
graph or

1510
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,599
have lots of experiments do it

1511
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,599
differently every time

1512
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,960
people get bored real quick when you do

1513
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,040
the same

1514
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,720
one of the tenets of training from the

1515
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,960
back of the room

1516
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:53,119
is different trump's same

1517
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,799
right doing things differently

1518
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:58,319
is better more more cognitively

1519
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,760
rewarding

1520
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,599
than if you do it the same every time

1521
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,559
even if you do it differently and then

1522
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,839
oh we had a crap daily scrum okay well

1523
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,839
it was one

1524
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,599
crap daily scrum

1525
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,640
right that's okay it's not the end of

1526
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,240
the world

1527
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,240
that we had one crop daily scrum

1528
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,599
so for this activity

1529
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,599
we just needed to figure out what's the

1530
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:28,319
purpose but in fact even those

1531
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,599
items are not of the

1532
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,400
they can still be used during the day

1533
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,520
yes

1534
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,839
absolutely

1535
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,520
except when they inhibit the purpose

1536
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,440
because the purpose is the over the

1537
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,359
thing we're trying to do

1538
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,520
and i do see quite often some of those

1539
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,680
things which is why and i added them to

1540
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,440
the list because we do sometimes see

1541
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,359
those things or sometimes often see

1542
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,960
those things inhibiting our ability to

1543
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,920
get to the outcome that we're trying to

1544
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,280
achieve

1545
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,319
with the daily

1546
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,880
so we just need to be careful right uh

1547
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:01,680
there are certain things that that we

1548
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,440
know work and we know don't but there's

1549
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,799
also things that sometimes they work and

1550
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,240
sometimes they don't and sometimes they

1551
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,359
work for a while and then they stop

1552
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,520
working

1553
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,359
right i'm pretty sure that the teams i

1554
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,760
work with will get

1555
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:16,160
soon bored about the breakout and

1556
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,720
breakouts and i will have to figure out

1557
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,359
something else

1558
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,359
yeah thank you

1559
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,440
i'll see you next time see you next time

1560
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:28,559
hopefully hopefully you can rearrange

1561
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,559
that other meeting that you have

1562
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,480
thank you have a good day bye

1563
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,520
so

1564
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,920
we have uh how many do we have now we

1565
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,520
have sev six people oh well that

1566
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,520
actually that actually works out well

1567
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,359
for asana because that makes the next

1568
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,760
exercise easier

1569
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,079
um easier for me

1570
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,400
for you because i wouldn't be able to to

1571
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,760
split the rooms and do that

1572
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,160
yeah you need you need to be a little

1573
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,359
bit of a teams breakout room guru to do

1574
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,760
to do this one we're gonna we're gonna

1575
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,640
do an an impromptu networking

1576
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,640
exercise where um we're going to we're

1577
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,920
going to break out into pairs

1578
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,799
and we should really uh hide those other

1579
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,480
uh questions anna we didn't do that

1580
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,240
earlier

1581
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,000
there we go

1582
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,839
i'll just hide it like that there we go

1583
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,480
perfect

1584
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:22,079
super simple

1585
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,680
and what we're going to do it we're

1586
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,160
going to we're going to do

1587
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,160
um

1588
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,559
well let's

1589
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,400
let me create three breakout rooms

1590
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,799
because there's six of us

1591
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,119
and we'll do pairs

1592
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:41,200
so three breakout rooms hopefully nobody

1593
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,200
else leaves in between otherwise

1594
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,960
that's

1595
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,240
a little bit of the

1596
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:52,559
downside of public events is if i have

1597
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,160
you in a in a private or public training

1598
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,039
you're trapped because you've paid to be

1599
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,520
there

1600
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,920
right but if uh

1601
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,920
if not then sometimes although

1602
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,440
you know i had private ones sometimes

1603
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,520
people have emergencies that they have

1604
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,520
to drop off for so

1605
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,799
it's just less likely

1606
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,400
so i'm gonna do impromptu networking

1607
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,839
we're gonna do pairs

1608
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,160
uh so i've got rooms one two and three

1609
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:18,000
and you can see that i have columns here

1610
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,760
with room one room two and room three

1611
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:26,240
the blue the pink and the purple columns

1612
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,559
and i'd like you to discuss in your pair

1613
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,799
that question so the first question is

1614
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,119
what would happen if we don't have a

1615
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,480
daily scrum

1616
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,680
okay so adding some post-its uh in that

1617
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,480
space uh would make sense and answering

1618
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,680
that question as a as a pair

1619
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,760
at the end of two minutes so you'll have

1620
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,079
two minutes to answer the question

1621
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,400
and i'm going to

1622
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,640
move one person from each pair to the

1623
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,640
next room

1624
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,960
okay so you'll be with you'll still be

1625
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,720
in a pair but it will be another person

1626
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,960
and then i'll do it again

1627
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,839
for the third question so you'll have

1628
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,839
three different pairs within the same

1629
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:10,160
meeting i did say it needs me to do use

1630
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,480
my microsoft teams kung fu

1631
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,280
uh to make that happen good luck with

1632
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,079
that

1633
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,760
i i i have done it before with 12 people

1634
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,400
successfully i have done it before with

1635
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,079
30 people very unsuccessfully

1636
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,599
um yeah the more more people the more

1637
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,640
complicated it is

1638
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:28,400
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

1639
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,079
open the the room and um one of you will

1640
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,319
stay in the existing room and the other

1641
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,039
person will move to the next incremental

1642
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:37,039
room or i will completely mess it up

1643
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,079
that's the other option that might

1644
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,680
happen

1645
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,359
i think christian i did it successfully

1646
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,799
with your group didn't i

1647
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,319
i did yes

1648
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,599
that was that was when it did work

1649
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,359
successfully

1650
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,799
um

1651
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,960
but it means i've got a little bit of

1652
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,960
homework to do to get it all to organize

1653
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,960
right

1654
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,920
so

1655
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,920
christian is pinned

1656
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,480
sean is pinned

1657
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,119
and

1658
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,119
frank is pinned

1659
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,520
okay

1660
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,400
and they're starting at one

1661
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,400
two three

1662
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,119

01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,839
room it puts you on hold

1687
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,920
okay it's just a it's a characteristic

1688
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,640
it's not a bug it's a characteristic of

1689
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,319
the

1690
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,599
characteristic tool

1691
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,839
it's a feature

1692
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,240
well it is a bit weird i would rather

1693
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:36,559
everybody went on hold

1694
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,720
than they left the meeting which is what

1695
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,559
happens in the list so that you get this

1696
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,880
little message saying they've lost

1697
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,559
access to the chat and then they rejoin

1698
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,480
and have access to the chat again but no

1699
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,319
history it that bit's annoying

1700
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,760
um but they're working on it that's

1701
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,520
actually a bug it's not supposed to do

1702
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,400
it that way

1703
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:57,119
so 50 seconds left so let me

1704
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,440
start up my engine of madness

1705
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,599
um so frank

1706
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,280
is going to

1707
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,480
one

1708
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,760
oh that's the

1709
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,359
all right this is the people that are

1710
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,280
moving christian

1711
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,880
is going to two

1712
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,440
and sean

1713
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,039
is going to three okay

1714
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,920
so that will be

1715
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,799
three

1716
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,039
one

1717
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,039
two

1718
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:28,480
i like one that they're right in here

1719
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,280
people will at some point

1720
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:36,000
set up something equivalent but quite

1721
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,000
possibly only with a subset of the team

1722
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,280
that's enough

1723
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:46,559
yep right i'm gonna click the button

1724
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,000
[Music]

1725
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,000
open out question two

1726
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,000
and add two minutes

1727
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,520
up peter's going sideways instead of

1728
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,520
vertically

1729
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,000
i'm waiting for it to all set up and

1730
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:10,680
then i can click the broadcast button

1731
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,680
and say move on to question two

1732
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,759
yeah so the little broadcast button the

1733
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,839
way

1734
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,920
teams works very differently completely

1735
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,040
differently from zoom from a mechanical

1736
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,279
perspective

1737
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,279
right what it what it's actually doing

1738
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,719
when you create breakout rooms is it's

1739
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,239
creating

1740
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:34,400
completely separate independent meetings

1741
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,480
in teams so they can actually click the

1742
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,799
record button in there they can they can

1743
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,640
do all use all of the tools

1744
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:43,040
um and then

1745
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,799
when i do a broadcast it just sends a

1746
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,719
message to each room

1747
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:49,839
so if i go to my chat

1748
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,120
in teams it's got all of the rooms and

1749
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,120
all of the messages for all of the

1750
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,120
classes so i might do 20 different

1751
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,040
breakout rooms for a class

1752
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,359
and you end up with room ones all over

1753
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,600
the place in room twos it's a bit mental

1754
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,600
um

1755
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,890
i

1756
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:09,520
yes i can i can see what i i'm

1757
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:12,960
[Music]

1758
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,960
thinking i want to do

1759
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,719
this

1760
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,239
so that they move on to

1761
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,799
you

1762
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,400
well i'm either that or i'm making life

1763
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:32,839
painful for them

1764
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,719
that is also an

1765
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:37,679
option uh

1766
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,679
let me get uh

1767
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,799
because there's only 14 seconds left

1768
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:49,279
[Laughter]

1769
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,560
oh

1770
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,239
i don't know if they know that they need

1771
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,239
to answer the second question

1772
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,840
uh

1773
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,840
yeah they've started

1774
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,679
so let me i've got to do the assignment

1775
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,000
madness again so

1776
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,679
frank

1777
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,440
is going to room

1778
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,600
two

1779
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,760
except i've got him listed in room two

1780
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,719
so i've completely balls this up

1781
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,560
sean

1782
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,080
is going to room one

1783
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,080
and christian

1784
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,920
is going to room three

1785
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,040
so the numbers i wrote down

1786
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,800
are crap

1787
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,719
but

1788
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,320
i'm picking i'm picking the right people

1789
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,320
so that part is working out

1790
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,360
i think people uh join some of these

1791
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:45,840
sessions just to laugh at my

1792
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,840
ability to do stuff that's what i think

1793
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,320
maybe

1794
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,320
maybe that's why i'm here

1795
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,480
you're my you're my support

1796
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,560
well we have found a bug with this

1797
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,480
exercise that people

1798
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,040
i didn't seem to explain it properly to

1799
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,840
move to the next question

1800
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,920
yeah but um we'll see what people did

1801
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,159
when they come back maybe they answered

1802
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,480
the next question but in the same role i

1803
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,480
don't know

1804
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,640
maybe it's a little confusing like when

1805
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,640
you move to the other uh

1806
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,800
to another room you have to skip to

1807
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,320
another question so

1808
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,400
yeah

1809
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,080
well yeah i could have done a better job

1810
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,760
of blocking off

1811
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,440
and having uh

1812
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,960
we knew that this was going to be a

1813
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,120
little bit

1814
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,400
yeah this is there's an experiment here

1815
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,320
for sure

1816
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,719
yeah but next time we'll know to have it

1817
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,280
like a blind

1818
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:56,719
that goes down and and

1819
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,719
stop some editing above yeah

1820
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,679
[Music]

1821
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:10,400
oh i can hear my audio problem

1822
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,080
is transferring out to

1823
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,000
the stream so apologies if you're on the

1824
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,440
stream i have an audio problem with

1825
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,520
teams i am on a beta version of teams

1826
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,280
um and

1827
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,199
this week i have had a weird audio noise

1828
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,360
that when i do breakout rooms if i go

1829
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:30,480
into a breakout room and come back

1830
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,600
it breaks the audio and i get a tone

1831
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,960
but if if it happens and anna speaks it

1832
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,679
goes away

1833
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:41,440
so okay yeah so we just have to let anna

1834
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,440
speak and i'll shut up there we go

1835
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:46,400
i don't know if i

1836
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,600
if i would manage to to do this on my

1837
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,600
own so

1838
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,440
speak please

1839
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,719
well i'm going to close the rooms

1840
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,159
because i think we've had two minutes in

1841
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,719
that team i didn't set a timer because

1842
01:12:54,159 --> 01:13:00,080
we were trying to unsnafu them

1843
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,080
um but i'll bring them back

1844
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:06,719
oh you're joven

1845
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,400
um

1846
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:17,120
it would be so cool if scenes had that

1847
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:19,520
feature like uh three second counter

1848
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,520
like

1849
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,320
yeah to go back to the main room or like

1850
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,920
a zoom zoom zoom mutes you when you come

1851
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,360
back to the main room

1852
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,040
but i actually find that really annoying

1853
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,280
because i i'm a teams user i'm not

1854
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,800
expecting to be muted when i go back to

1855
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,800
the main room so

1856
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:39,440
um yeah that's kind of uh

1857
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,679
what happens a little bit there

1858
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,679
so

1859
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:46,239
um

1860
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,840
so what

1861
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,159
what what happened about

1862
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,199
in my explanation

1863
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,280
uh that was lost on me yeah cool no they

1864
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,199
were progressing downward

1865
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,840
and i think i started

1866
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,040
deleting the black arrows because you're

1867
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,520
like what the hell are these things

1868
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,520
doing here

1869
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,400
pasting black arrows

1870
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,560
i'm sorry about that yeah no it was it

1871
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,560
anna and i totally agreed that it was it

1872
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,880
was my dysfunction there either not

1873
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,800
explaining it properly or not i i should

1874
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,440
have had the arrows in it and the arrows

1875
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,280
appeared as i moved the thing down that

1876
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,960
would have been better but i see it's

1877
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,000
it's kind of it's kind of worked out i

1878
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,000
can delete the arrows now

1879
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:32,640
um

1880
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,640
so anna would you like to debrief

1881
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,480
sorry would you like to debrief this one

1882
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,920
oh

1883
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,360
yeah so

1884
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,440
in

1885
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,320
room one

1886
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:46,159
about what would happen if we

1887
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,239
don't have a daily scrum let's see what

1888
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,679
we have in in the three rooms

1889
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,400
um

1890
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:55,040
anything that you see that uh

1891
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,960
we have a pattern in here

1892
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,000
a lot of

1893
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,000
sync meetings

1894
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,199
slower

1895
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,440
slower decision making

1896
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:10,440
less focus

1897
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,440
oh

1898
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,280
so anything

1899
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,239
yep

1900
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:20,239
less alignment

1901
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,960
and something that i

1902
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:25,199
really found very interesting was people

1903
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,159
will at some point set up

1904
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:31,360
something equivalent but quite possibly

1905
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:34,159
only with a subset of the team

1906
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,840
but for the us um

1907
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,360
i never thought about that but it was uh

1908
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,880
surprisingly true

1909
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,239
did it happen to any one of you this

1910
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,520
absolutely

1911
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,239
okay

1912
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,480
yeah clandestine meetings

1913
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,480
with

1914
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,560
decisions coming from it

1915
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,560
that are not shared yes

1916
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,600
so should we jump to the next uh

1917
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,040
question martin or

1918
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,800
uh

1919
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,840
i

1920
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,040
let's see on the time

1921
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:16,000
i i'm not sure are you what

1922
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,000
to the second question

1923
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,040
yes i think we have time for that

1924
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:24,640
sorry i was i was i was planning

1925
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,640
planning what's next in my head there

1926
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:30,800
so we have here high risk of not

1927
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:33,800
reaching it and lack of pure feedback

1928
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,800
um

1929
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,199
so this is uh what happens with uh if we

1930
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:42,000
don't focus on the spring goal

1931
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:44,640
do you want to share anything about this

1932
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,640
we wrote it

1933
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,080
i would say

1934
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,600
the first one's obvious and there's not

1935
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,719
rich you can't not focusing on it how

1936
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,000
long you're going to get there but i

1937
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,520
think the other one is slightly more

1938
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,719
more interesting

1939
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,480
which is

1940
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,520
people might say well what about po

1941
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,640
feedback

1942
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,000
well

1943
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,000
if you're not focusing on the goal if

1944
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,880
you are focused if you are focusing on

1945
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,239
the goal

1946
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,679
then you're going to be suddenly saying

1947
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:07,520
about

1948
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,520
should this be blue or green

1949
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,880
and someone will go off and say to the

1950
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,480
product owner do you want this blue or

1951
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,159
green at which point you get some

1952
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,360
feedback and you do an in sprint

1953
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,640
correction

1954
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,120
if you're just

1955
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,560
plowing along and

1956
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,080
doing whatever the hell it is you know

1957
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,400
making bottles

1958
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,440
them or or not focusing on whatever the

1959
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,440
goal is

1960
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,440
you know is this red wine or white wine

1961
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,440
um

1962
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,440
what is the time now

1963
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,280
i watched the pub in 15 minutes

1964
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,280
um

1965
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,400
stay focused

1966
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,080
and again i suppose that's about value

1967
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,840
focus on the goal i don't know what any

1968
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,280
issues are about reaching that goal if

1969
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,560
you need to course correction with your

1970
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,480
po go off and talk to your po

1971
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,239
yeah and i believe that leaves with uh

1972
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,600
with the next question because if you

1973
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,679
don't have a goal

1974
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,400
you cannot build a plan to reach

1975
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,400
something right

1976
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,040
so risk and waste will be made lack of

1977
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,640
focus non-delivery

1978
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,440
um

1979
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,800
success exactly it's accidental and no

1980
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,239
alignment

1981
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,719
so

1982
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:25,679
yeah so some some some teams

1983
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,920
think that they're just unpredictable

1984
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,360
right their predictability is low

1985
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,520
but it can often be that they don't have

1986
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,280
a goal so success then becomes

1987
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,960
accidental

1988
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,960
why do we fail so many sprints

1989
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,800
right oh because your goal is complete

1990
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,960
these 12

1991
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,800
right so

1992
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,480
you might make it you might not and it

1993
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,480
will be random chance on whether you do

1994
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,159
or you don't right how do the how do the

1995
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,040
dice roll this

1996
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:54,199
uh

1997
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,199
this sprint

1998
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,920
yeah

1999
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:03,280
so yeah without a without a spring goal

2000
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,320
we cannot plan to get to that uh to that

2001
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,440
goal

2002
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:11,120
and without a daily um there is no

2003
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,760
a specific moment uh to plan on the day

2004
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:17,040
to reach that spring goal so everything

2005
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,040
is is really linked

2006
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,280
okay

2007
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,280
yeah

2008
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,199
christian's furiously writing down

2009
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,760
things

2010
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:31,040
he's a christian's a notetaker

2011
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,040
he's not actually ignoring us

2012
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,280
so i think we should jump to the the

2013
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,719
conclusion anna because we have 11

2014
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:39,440
minutes

2015
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,719
oh yeah yeah yeah

2016
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,880
see i'm doing better at the time thing

2017
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:47,440
peter

2018
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,560
yeah feedback is golden yes exactly

2019
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,080
um

2020
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,360
so i think if we've got we can do uh two

2021
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:57,040
minutes each

2022
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:59,679
on the what so what now what

2023
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:02,320
um what i'd like you to do is um just

2024
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,400
individually

2025
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,840
right and we're gonna do three rounds

2026
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,960
we're gonna have two minutes for each

2027
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,120
round

2028
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,320
um and in round one we're gonna we're

2029
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,199
gonna answer

2030
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:14,080
those questions there are to help

2031
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,280
right

2032
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,040
what happened

2033
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,520
what did you notice

2034
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,040
what facts or observations stood stood

2035
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,639
out and you can go have a look around

2036
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,320
the around the mural how people answered

2037
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,360
to get some of those

2038
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,040
um

2039
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:33,520
ideas so what what what do you think was

2040
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,760
what happened during this

2041
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,360
um this this workshop so i'll put two

2042
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,120
minutes on

2043
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:43,040
um and i'll i'll do my usual hiding so

2044
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:46,710
we're just adding

2045
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:49,760
i'm not sure what you are

2046
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,760
[Music]

2047
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,560
to think about um what what we talked

2048
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,800
about what

2049
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
you learned and what happened

2050
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,480
during during this sprint was there

2051
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,480
something that that stood out for you

2052
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,920
that's actually what's the group what's

2053
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,840
the critical what's the critical lesson

2054
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,120
that i've learned

2055
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,080
yes

2056
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:19,520
what happened and then okay

2057
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,719
i hate to say

2058
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,719
i'll write it more than the same

2059
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,520
nothing is an okay answer peter

2060
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,040
no no

2061
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,040
one always learns something in life

2062
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,920
i'll go

2063
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:46,639
mute actually your audio has been okay

2064
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,080
since since i feel like well i i had

2065
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,000
another

2066
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:53,520
microphone it was

2067
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,520
fully charged yeah yeah

2068
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,760
breakout sessions

2069
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,199
i i i still

2070
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,840
would like to talk about that a little

2071
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:04,239
more a breakout session during the

2072
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,400
during the planning uh during the daily

2073
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,440
stand up

2074
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,760
i um how that pans out anna

2075
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,760
do you have do you have a little bit of

2076
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,159
time to go over

2077
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,400
yeah so i anna anna can hang out for a

2078
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:21,840
little bit and talk about that i i

2079
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:25,199
actually have a reasonably hard stop

2080
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,520
at well 7 p.m for me but in in nine ish

2081
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:30,400
minutes because i have to go meet up

2082
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,239
with ralph jochem and help him with some

2083
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,080
mural stuff

2084
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,760
um for his class that he's doing next

2085
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,639
week and this was the time that we had

2086
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,520
so

2087
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:42,159
i'm gonna gonna go off and do that but

2088
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,280
anna anna will be able to host everybody

2089
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,280
who's here

2090
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,920
um but it will be off stream so maybe

2091
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,920
that's a good thing

2092
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:54,400
okay so i'm gonna open up round two

2093
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,760
so don't be typing in round one now

2094
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,600
that's uh

2095
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,159
round one it's finished

2096
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,440
why is that important

2097
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:04,080
right

2098
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:07,840
what patterns or conclusions

2099
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,840
might be emerging

2100
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,719
maybe what hype

2101
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,520
i don't understand frank while why

2102
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,280
keyboards still come with a caps lock

2103
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,639
key that's what i don't understand oh

2104
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,639
yeah yeah yeah

2105
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,080
i know i do it too and you accidentally

2106
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,960
hit it and then you end up with

2107
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,480
lowercase first letters

2108
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,360
i do it all the time

2109
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,960
and

2110
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:34,080
unfortunately i've got a keyboard where

2111
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,679
you can't remove the keys very easily so

2112
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,400
i'd like to remove the caps lock key and

2113
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,400
the insert key yeah yeah those are two

2114
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,400
completely useless keys yeah but you

2115
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,080
can't do it with this one i've got we've

2116
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,040
got the same keyboard

2117
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:50,159
yeah yeah the light of the caps lock is

2118
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,560
doesn't light up anymore

2119
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:53,840
oh mine does light up but um that

2120
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,000
doesn't help me because i don't look at

2121
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,000
it

2122
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:12,239
nice setup with mural uh martin

2123
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,360
uh it's my comp i'd like to compliment

2124
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:17,199
you

2125
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:18,639
it has taken a lot of iterations to get

2126
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,639
um

2127
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,560
my murals but literally i've got a drag

2128
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,840
and drop capability for most of the

2129
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,440
things now

2130
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,639
and i was always like this is the

2131
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,639
exercise we should have and then i

2132
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,679
replace it with this one that looks with

2133
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,600
all of the

2134
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,280
the the the

2135
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,760
setups but yeah

2136
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:39,679
thanks for every kind of exercise for

2137
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:42,400
every liberating structure because

2138
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:45,679
when you live in mural

2139
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:48,960
because i'll quite often um

2140
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:51,360
like i'll spend at least

2141
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,480
what what are what are uh i'll spend at

2142
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,800
least 16 hours a week if not 24 hours a

2143
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:59,040
week in mural yeah yeah

2144
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:01,040
so but you did quite a time investment

2145
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,080
in developing all those templates yeah

2146
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,520
yes

2147
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,840
refining them

2148
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,159
and then uh yeah but it really pays off

2149
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,440
well i i don't me though but uh

2150
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,520
you know yeah the only i as i i always

2151
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,719
say if if i

2152
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:19,280
had this i've opened out round three

2153
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:22,080
and in round three it's

2154
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,840
oh i've er left the same text but what

2155
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:25,199
now

2156
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,440
let me delete that text because it's

2157
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:29,840
confusing what now what could you what

2158
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,280
could you do now what could you change

2159
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:35,080
in the way

2160
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,080
you do things next

2161
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:48,239
i like that improvement requires effort

2162
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,120
i know that's a good one

2163
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,960
sorry

2164
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:54,239
there's a in in round two there's an

2165
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,960
improvement requires effort yeah and i

2166
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:59,040
think that's what a lot of people

2167
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:02,480
take time to realize

2168
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:06,000
yeah well and i have to say that um

2169
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:07,440
um i've been trying uh in the dailies to

2170
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,719
do this

2171
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,440
experiments

2172
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,560
and

2173
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,199
it it doesn't work at first

2174
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:18,320
you you have to try it several times so

2175
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:19,280
that the team starts uh engaging with it

2176
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,400
and

2177
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,080
for example

2178
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,600
sharing metrics and and and helping them

2179
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,080
understanding the metrics i know that

2180
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,360
the scrum masters are not in a daily to

2181
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,560
facilitate

2182
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,679
but we need to help that event to be

2183
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,480
effective

2184
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:36,480
and positive

2185
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,760
and

2186
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,880
there are a lot of techniques that can

2187
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,040
be used on start metrics and i use flow

2188
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:50,600
metrics the overall the aging work in

2189
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:50,600
progress i believe that in the scrum.org

2190
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:59,760
there's the kanban guide for scrum teams

2191
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:02,000
and then there's the professional scrum

2192
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,679
with kanban class

2193
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,040
uh which i'm actually i'm running one

2194
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:09,120
next week

2195
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:11,520
yeah i saw it yeah i think in the other

2196
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:15,679
next to assets there's the the emblem of

2197
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,440
uh scrambled or psk oh yes that's so

2198
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,280
um we we

2199
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:22,080
we're going to spend a little bit of

2200
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:24,639
time talking about the metrics but time

2201
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:27,520
time caught up with us as it always does

2202
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,880
and we thought we'd left enough room

2203
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,600
um

2204
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,840
but

2205
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,679
that's it's always not true right it's

2206
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,040
always not true

2207
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,440
but

2208
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,520
the way i think about it frank is all of

2209
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:43,360
these things that i build in mural are

2210
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,360
just invitations to a conversation

2211
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:49,040
uh yeah

2212
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:52,080
yeah and bright colors and nice looking

2213
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:54,400
you know structures do help

2214
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,639
simple as that and i i think it's even

2215
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,560
more in the virtual world than in the

2216
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,880
physical world

2217
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:04,239
because in especially when you go into

2218
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,880
to to meetings and events and uh you're

2219
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:08,719
doing things online

2220
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,400
you need a little bit more guidance a

2221
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:13,199
little bit more focus so that we're all

2222
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,800
on the same page um so i i do do a

2223
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,639
number of workshops where i just start

2224
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,960
with a blank mural

2225
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:22,239
yeah yeah um and just use it to put

2226
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,719
notes on and have ideation and

2227
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:27,280
it it it really does help but all of my

2228
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,400
scrum dog classes use these these types

2229
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,560
of templates

2230
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,000
um because there's just so many things

2231
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,760
to cover and so many things to talk

2232
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
about

2233
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,520
yeah

2234
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,440
in the physical world

2235
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,000
when i run workshops i do like to have

2236
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,840
as many different color it's a number of

2237
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,040
different shaped post-its and a number

2238
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,960
of different

2239
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:49,679
colored sharpie pens and i bought

2240
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,360
another maybe 40 different colors in it

2241
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,120
and you just tip these out into the

2242
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,719
middle of the table and people think oh

2243
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,400
i want the bright pink one or i want the

2244
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,760
bright blue one so at least it just

2245
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,840

not heavy yellow post-its and a heap of

2247
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,679

that corner over there yeah yeah

2254
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,800

so that's that's good uh getting this

2259
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,320
really powerful new computer um and i'm

2260
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,080
gonna clean out this room and i'm

2261
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,760
basically putting all of the in person

2262
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,800
class stuff in the attic

2263
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,880
um i i much prefer

2264
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,480
the engagement that i get with people in

2265
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,440
the live virtual space

2266
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:45,440
um i've been i've got a blog post that

2267
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,840
i'm working on where i'm analyzing the

2268
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:50,159
data from all of my classes

2269
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,159
um so specific specifically for

2270
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:56,960
scrum.org classes i've done

2271
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:58,080
67 classes since lockdown

2272
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,880
began

2273
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,960
all live virtual classes and i've got

2274
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,199
data of how many people pass the

2275
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,440
assessments i've got people that have

2276
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:09,120
done trust pilot reviews

2277
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,760
so i've got all of my trustpilot data

2278
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:14,400
i've got all of my assessment outcome

2279
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,800
data um and i'm putting a blog post

2280
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,960
together to to to look at

2281
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,360
um

2282
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,840
why i think it's better

2283
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,080
so you you compare in person you're in

2284
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,880
person yep scores

2285
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,480
yep okay interesting and i have i have i

2286
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,239
have a average

2287
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,920
for example i have all of the assessment

2288
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:36,719
scores for everybody that's taken a

2289
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,800
class with me that took an assessment

2290
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,639
and i've got averages for each total

2291
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,520
averages and averages for each class as

2292
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,560
well

2293
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,239
um

2294
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,000
so but you need to say that you're going

2295
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,679
to clear out that cupboard with all

2296
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
these board games you're gonna put them

2297
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,280
in so it will give me room for more

2298
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,360
board games

2299
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,040
okay because i i wouldn't do that i

2300
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,040
would leave them there i'm going to

2301
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:59,679
leave them there but i have i have all

2302
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,600
of i have all this posters and all kinds

2303
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:04,239
of things in that in that space that

2304
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,480
needs to go and more stuff over here

2305
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:08,000
that all needs to go yeah

2306
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,320
um

2307
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,320
yeah

2308
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,719
so i but nothing beats a board game with

2309
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:17,280
a group of people and they're sharing a

2310
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:19,920
table eh no absolutely absolutely we've

2311
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,560
been doing a lot of live virtual uh

2312
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,000
board games which is not as good

2313
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,000
um

2314
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,239
but i definitely like that that

2315
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,840
camaraderie that

2316
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:31,120
feeling of just just playing them

2317
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,560
together even if when you're playing a

2318
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,719
euro game and there's not really that

2319
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,560
much collaboration between like a lot of

2320
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:38,400
a lot of the the the really heavy euro

2321
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,840
games there's very little contact

2322
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,000
between people you're just playing

2323
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,719
against each other for score

2324
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,880
um but it's still it's still a lot of

2325
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,280
fun and definitely cognitive yeah

2326
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,639
peter's got to go to the pub

2327
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:53,600
he's going to get

2328
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,600
going to get blue turd

2329
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,840
bye-bye bye

2330
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:05,120
well i'm i'm i'm hoping um that i'm i'm

2331
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,679
going to leave you as well with with

2332
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:11,360
anna um i've summoned everybody in the

2333
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:13,760
mural to the to the to the feedback wall

2334
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:16,080
so any feedback would be good maybe what

2335
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,159
next sessions you would like i did

2336
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:21,040
notice anna that almost everybody that

2337
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:24,719
came this time was a practitioner

2338
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:26,800
um so maybe we can we we're not doing a

2339
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,800
introduction to next time maybe we need

2340
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,600
to do a more advanced

2341
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,960
uh

2342
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:36,400
topic maybe we need to go go spelunk the

2343
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,800
the pspo2 or the psm2 and see if we

2344
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:42,880
can't find some interesting things to

2345
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,880
talk about for the next time

2346
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:47,280
well

2347
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:49,920
you know i did get some nice ideas and

2348
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:53,280
it's always good to share you know with

2349
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,960
other people uh

2350
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,560
i mean the topic was

2351
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,400
it was quite basic of course but

2352
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,840
nonetheless you know

2353
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,560
and you don't control uh the

2354
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,760
participants i know that problem no so

2355
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,880
yeah some

2356
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:09,360
some sessions we get lots of lots of

2357
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,880
noobs and that's great as well and

2358
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,320
sometimes we get lots of practitioners

2359
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,520
and it's honestly it's different

2360
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,679
questions

2361
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,920
right it's different questions we go

2362
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,360
different level of depth into things and

2363
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,840
and that's cool too

2364
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,040
so um

2365
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,239
yeah and the most difficult of course is

2366
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,639
when you have

2367
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:28,960
those two groups in one session yes how

2368
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,960
can you cater to both that's not what

2369
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,719
well what's interesting is i i do it

2370
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,600
actually well i do it the same way that

2371
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:37,920
i do it in physical classes

2372
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,120
right well physical you know what i mean

2373
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,800
in in professional classes is i i i make

2374
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:45,280
sure they

2375
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,800
understand that part of their job is to

2376
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,080
help coach people in the different

2377
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,400
groups they're in

2378
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,199
not give away the secrets

2379
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,080
right yeah uh and and see

2380
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,080
how

2381
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,480
those conversations pan out with people

2382
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:01,600
and see how you can shape them and so be

2383
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:03,280
being a lean agile practitioner in the

2384
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,880
in the sessions as well and that can be

2385
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,000
a lot of fun

2386
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,000
um because

2387
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,880
christian is a is a is an advanced

2388
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,760
practitioner and he was in my pspo uh

2389
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,080
last week with some folks he knows um

2390
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,679
and he was a lot of help in the in the

2391
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,120
in the sessions striving some of the

2392
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:20,719
conversation coming up with some of

2393
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,719
those ideas explaining things in a

2394
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:25,280
different way than i would uh which

2395
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:26,239
helps people understand which is great

2396
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,400
yeah

2397
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:32,880
so i i am we are going to wrap up the

2398
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,239
the the stream anna is definitely going

2399
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:38,480
to hang out for a little bit because i

2400
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:38,480
know frank has some additional questions

2401
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,880
in minutes

2402
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,360

2406
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,679
the stream
