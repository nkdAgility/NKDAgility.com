The closest overlap is in general references to team and organizational improvement, which aligns with collective achievement but falls well short of the criteria. Scoring is appropriately low across Direct Mentions, Conceptual Alignment, Depth, and Intent, though Audience and Signal are somewhat higher as the audience and relevance narrowly match organizational agility practitioners.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content highlights Scrum Master professional development but lacks any discussion of collective intelligence, human-AI collaboration, or related themes.

It discusses advanced Scrum Master skills, team improvement, product ownership, feedback loops, and agile career growth, but never references OKRsâ€”either explicitly or conceptually. There are no discussions on measurable objectives, key results, outcome-based frameworks, or alignment with John Doerr's principles. All mention of continuous improvement, feedback, or coaching are tied directly to Scrum mastery rather than OKRs. The intended audience is agile practitioners and Scrum Masters, who could be interested in OKRs, but nothing in the content references or implies anything about Objective Key Results as defined in the classification.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a promotional overview of the PSM II course, focusing on deepening Scrum Master skills, team facilitation, product owner support, and agile career growth. While it briefly mentions empowerment, feedback loops, and automation practices, these references are generic and oriented toward Scrum proficiencyâ€”not the deliberate engineering of agency for humans and AI, nor the philosophical underpinnings of Agentic Engineering. There is no substantive discussion of systemic observability, ethical AI integration, decision decentralization, or feedback-driven adaptation in an engineering context. The audience, context, and intent center around Scrum certification rather than agentic engineering practice, with only marginal conceptual overlap in passing mentions of empowerment and automation.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content stays focused on promoting PSM II Scrum Master training. While it glancingly mentions empowerment and automation, it does not address the intentional design of engineering practices to maximize human and AI agency.
