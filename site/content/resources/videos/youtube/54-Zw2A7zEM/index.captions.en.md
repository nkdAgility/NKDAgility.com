While our seasoned Agile coach will definitely include all of the knowledge that a Scrum Master has, it will be deeper with more experience. Effectively, more battle-hardened, they're usually somebody that has had long years of experience working in organisations, developing and implementing Agile practices within organisations and learning the deep technical expertise in Lean, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban that they need in order to be successful. Ultimately, they know where all the bodies are buried. They've seen the successes, they've seen the failures, they know what works and what doesn't. They are there to really help the organisation excel.
