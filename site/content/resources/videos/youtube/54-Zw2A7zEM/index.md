## Scrum Master vs. Seasoned Agile Coach: What Sets Them Apart?

The Scrum Master and the Agile Coach are two roles integral to the Agile universe.

But what distinguishes one from the other? ðŸ¤”

While both roles have inherent value, some distinctions are worth noting.

## The Depth of Knowledge

Every seasoned Agile Coach encompasses all the knowledge that a Scrum Master possesses. However, the depth of this knowledge is profound, stemming from more hands-on experience â€“ essentially making them more battle-hardened. ðŸ’ª

## Years in the Field

Typically, an Agile Coach has been in the game for a long time, enriched with many years of experience, having worked diligently within organisations. Â ðŸ’¡

They've dedicated years to navigating organisational landscapes, moulding and embedding Agile practices, and mastering techniques spanning from lean Agile to Scrum and Kanban. Â ðŸš€

They don't just "know" - they've _lived_ it. ðŸ“ˆ

## Knowing 'Where the Bodies Are Buried'

There's a saying that an Agile Coach 'knows where all the bodies are buried.' ðŸŒŸ

In essence, they've witnessed both the highs and the lows. They've celebrated the wins and learned from the missteps, giving them a unique perspective on what truly resonates and what might falter. ðŸŽ¯

## Guiding Organisations to Greatness

Above all, An Agile Coaches main mission is to propel organisations to new heights.

With a treasure trove of experiences, an Agile Coach is not just there to instruct. They're there to elevate, ensuring organisations implement and excel in their Agile journeys. ðŸŒ±
