# The Power of Automated Testing

# The Power of Automated Testing in Modern Software Engineering | Martin Hinshelwood  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I dive into the critical role automated testing plays in modern software engineering. From reducing human error to speeding up feedback cycles, automated testing is a game-changer for delivering high-quality software that drives profit and value for your organization. Letâ€™s explore how to automate smarter, not harder, and build a foundation of engineering excellence.

**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Automated Testing Matters  
2. 02:00 â€“ Reducing Human Error with Automation  
3. 05:00 â€“ The Value of Fast Feedback Loops  
4. 08:15 â€“ Balancing Test Infrastructure and Complexity  
5. 12:00 â€“ Lessons from Azure DevOps: Transforming Test Strategies  
6. 16:30 â€“ Automating Everything: Best Practices for Engineers  
7. 21:00 â€“ Building a Culture of Engineering Excellence  

**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  

- Developers and engineers looking to improve their testing practices  
- Engineering leaders striving for faster, more reliable deployments  
- Organizations seeking to reduce errors and optimize their software delivery pipeline  

**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  

- Why humans struggle with repetitive tasks and how automation solves this  
- The risks of chasing code coverage and the value of meaningful tests  
- How fast-running unit tests can replace slow, error-prone end-to-end tests  
- The importance of lean, discrete tests for better modularity and reliability  
- Strategies to automate your testing process and reduce manual steps  
- Real-world insights from Azure DevOpsâ€™ journey to three-minute test cycles  

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  

- Automation reduces errors, speeds up feedback, and saves time for delivering value.  
- Testing should be fast, modular, and as automated as possible for maximum efficiency.  
- The fewer manual steps between code and production, the better your delivery pipeline.  
- Automated testing isnâ€™t about quality; itâ€™s about creating opportunities to innovate and grow.
