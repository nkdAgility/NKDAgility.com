It positions Azure DevOps and NKD Agility as solutions for removing such friction and achieving 'engineering excellence.' While 'Operational Practices' is not mentioned directly or frequently, the narrative aligns conceptually: identifying waste and bottlenecks, promoting process improvement, and advocating for DevOps techniques to modernize and improve workflow. The discussion is introductory, naming key concepts (lead times, manual releases, flow), but does not deeply explore practices or metrics. The intent is well-aligned—to raise awareness and prompt action for operational improvement among engineering leads and teams. The target audience (technical leaders, Agile/DevOps practitioners) matches the category. The majority of content is relevant, though a portion functions as marketing/series promotion.",
