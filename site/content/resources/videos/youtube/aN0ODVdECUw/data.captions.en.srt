1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,680
For most organizations,

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,919
they have a a a ton of legacy systems.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
And legacy systems are are they're

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,080
holding back their ability to innovate.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,080
They're holding back their ability to um

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,119
move

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,920
towards the new features and

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,080
capabilities that they're looking for.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:30,160
Um mostly because it gets in the way. It

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,000
adds friction. any anytime you've got a

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
bunch of engineers

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,079
working on anybody working on something

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,719
and you put something

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,480
in their way, it creates a little bit of

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,879
friction, right? And if you have enough

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,879
friction,

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,079
then most people give up. Most people

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,920
are not, you know, the the the the the

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
sort of person that's going to try and

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
fiddle with it until they get it

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,920
working. They just want it to work. And

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,720
if you put enough things in the way,

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
it's it's the same reason that you put a

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
lock on your house or an alarm on your

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,240
car, it's not going to stop a

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,799
professional thief, somebody who's

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,520
really trying uh to get around those

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
things, but it dissuades the vast

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
majority of people. And that's about

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
friction. you're adding friction in that

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
case for a positive outcome, not having

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,799
your car stolen. Um, but in in in

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
engineering work in organizational

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
systems,

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,200
every piece of friction you add in the

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,520
way um makes it less likely that people

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,000
will bother doing the thing that you

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,079
want them to do. So part of

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
working towards

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,320
these ideas around engineering

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,399
excellence is that we want to remove the

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
friction, right? We want to remove that

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
friction because what that friction

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,719
leads to and legacy systems are a huge

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
part of that friction

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
is

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
long lead times, fragile deployments,

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
and your architectures just don't scale

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,640
because

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,720
the the the the effort to change the

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,360
system to get it to the point where it

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
can scale is just insurmountable. And

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
that that friction can be seen at the

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
engineering level with the engineering

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
teams um having difficulty. It can be

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,440
seen at at management level with

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,120
approvals, right? Um why is this going

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,959
to take so long? What is this big

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,879
investment in this thing that's not

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,200
going to provide any value to our our

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,280
direct value to our customers? Well,

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
it's going to provide long-term value to

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,720
our customers. In in 6 months, we'll be

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,599
able to um increase the number of users

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,360
that we have. And it it just often

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,080
doesn't fly because there's not a clear

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,599
understanding of of what it is. There's

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
not a clear understanding of what the

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
problem is and there's not a clear

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
understanding of how do we reduce the

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,920
friction in order to make things

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
successful. And once you have that

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,120
friction in these legacy systems and

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
there's nothing wrong with systems that

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,720
have been around for a long time, that's

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,400
that's not a legacy system. I mean, it

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,319
is, right? It's a system that's been

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,720
around for a long time. But for example,

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,280
Windows has been around for a really

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,000
long time. 1985

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,760
85 something like that. That's a really

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,280
long time, right? That's nearly is 40

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,120
years. 40 year 50 years of Microsoft.

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,040
They just celebrated their their their

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,640
50th anniversary and 40 years of Windows

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,040
at least. So why why don't we think of

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Windows as a legacy system? because it's

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,720
continually updated and maintained and

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,720
people collaborate on how do we get rid

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
of these little frictions that come

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
along. It starts with a bit of

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,280
sandpaper, right, getting in our way.

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,599
Um, but it turns into a bunch of

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,239
boulders and the engine seizes up and we

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,920
can't move forward.

96
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,040
So, your legacy systems

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:14,080
are what's holding back your ability to

98
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:17,280
to innovate, to shorten your lead times,

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,199
to improve quality in your products, and

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,519
to scale your architectures. You need to

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,519
fix them.
