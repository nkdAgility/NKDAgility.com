And so what is the most rewarding part of being a Scrum developer? Building stuff that matters to people. The work that you do should matter. The work that you do doesn't matter, why would you bother getting out of bed in the morning? Why would you care about the thing that you're working on? Why would you spend that extra effort to understand it a little bit better or do something a little bit more creative? Right? Creativity and competence and excellence come from us feeling like the work we do matters. If it matters to others, it matters to us, and we'll focus on it, and we'll do more better work.
