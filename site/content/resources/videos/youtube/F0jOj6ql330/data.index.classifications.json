Conceptual alignment is weak, as the content discusses meaning and impact in a broad sense, not the specificity of Increments as tangible outputs of Sprints. Some relevance exists because developers do deliver increments in Scrum, but this article never connects satisfaction or purpose to the act of incrementally delivering working software.
