1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,860
and so what is the most rewarding part

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,319
of being a scrum developer

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,280
building stuff that matters to people

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,139
the work that you do should matter the

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,580
work that you do doesn't matter why

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,220
would you bother getting out of bed in

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,080
the morning why would you care about the

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,000
thing that you're working on why would

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,000
you spend that extra effort to

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,680
understand it a little bit better or do

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,960
something a little bit more creative

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,520
right creativity and competence and

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,200
excellence

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,540
come from us feeling like the work we do

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,780
matters if it matters to others it

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,820
matters to us and we'll focus on it and

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,820
we'll do more better work
