    "reasoning": "The content primarily addresses technical debt, sustainable architecture, DevOps, and automation as enablers for efficient scaling and maintaining quality. Its focus is on how technical debt affects productivity and growth from an internal perspective, discussing productivity, complexity, and internal team morale. There are indirect nods to delivering features that 'matter' and responding 'to market demands,' but no explicit, substantive discussion of customer outcomes or value measurement from the customer's perspective. Feedback loops and automation are described in terms of internal speed and quality rather than customer satisfaction or insights. There is no measurement of customer impact, nor does customer need drive prioritization in the arguments. As such, alignment, depth, and direct mention scores remain moderate to low, and the content is only partially relevant to the strict Customer Focus definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article touches on value delivery and responsiveness, its main thrust is internal efficiency and quality, not true customer focus. There’s little to no direct discussion of actual customer needs, measurement, or outcomes, so confidence in the Customer Focus fit is low.",
