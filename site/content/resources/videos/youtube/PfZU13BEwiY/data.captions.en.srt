1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,080
scaling without managing technical debt

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:08,440
is a recipe for

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,280
disaster technical debt slows everything

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,240
down every quick fix or shortcut adds

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,000
complexity at first it's manageable but

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,600
as you scale it becomes a major blocker

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,119
new features take longer to deliver bugs

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,320
become more frequent and productivity

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,199
drops scaling isn't just about adding

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,720
resources it's about building on a

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,600
stable Foundation if you're architecture

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,960
isn't solid every new addition becomes a

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,879
risk that's where naked agility helps we

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,280
work with teams to implement sustainable

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,120
architecture and devops practices we

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,160
identify and address weak points

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,760
ensuring your systems are ready to

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,199
handle growth with automated testing

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,680
continuous integration and streamlined

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,480
deployments you can scale efficiently

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
and

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
confidently if you're ready to scale

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,440
without being slowed down by technical
