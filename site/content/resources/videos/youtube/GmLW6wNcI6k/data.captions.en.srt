1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,840
so the question is what does the

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,340
assessment phase of a Consulting

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,960
engagement look like

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,400
and I think ideally there isn't one or

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,619
not quite that it's asynchronous

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,980
a consultant should be continually

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,380
assessing the needs of the business that

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,519
they're working with and quite often

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,519
having that

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,200
if if we agree that we work in the the

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,840
complex space right we know less upfront

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,600
than we discover by doing

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,579
so anything that you do do in an

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,559
assessment phase

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,020
probably a lot of it is throwaway

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,940
because as you start engaging with the

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,559
customer as you start doing stuff you

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,360
start realizing that that's you know

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,340
that wasn't true or it wasn't quite

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,899
right or a completely different thing is

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,059
happening anyway

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,159
lots of customers like an assessment

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,680
phase because then you come in you

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,960
assess what it is that they're doing and

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,119
then they they they decide whether they

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,799
want your help in in fixing whatever it

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,760
is that you've identified

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,799
but in actual fact I think there's more

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,040
value

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:27,180
in just helping just getting started

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,619
just engaging with uh with teams just

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,100
engaging with with people and learn what

33
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,400
the current state of the organization is

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:42,560
by engage by by that in engagement right

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,939
through that engagement so so while I do

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
sometimes do

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,860
um that that kind of assessment phase I

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,659
would probably

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,780
it's not something that I would

40
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,220
recommend to a customer

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,380
um I just want to get started I just

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,540
want to help them I just want to

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,060
um get going so if we can get away

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,079
without it that's awesome if we have to

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,740
do it it might be there's a great

46
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,979
um

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,900
a a phrase like how much backlog do you

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,060
need it's the same idea how much of an

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,360
assessment do you need to do up front

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,400
and the answer is always the same as as

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,160
much as you need to convince the

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,500
customer to to work with you right

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,819
so if if you're going to do assessment

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,060
do just enough but not more

55
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,160
um that is needed to get the cus to

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,860
understand the customer enough to

57
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,800
convince them to to bring you on get

58
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,260
some help and then as you start helping

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,019
them and demonstrating your competence

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,700
and we can start saying well all that

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,280
stuff we thought up front is kind of

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,480
kind of irrelevant now and and let's get

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,060
started

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,459
um I I did a lot of work early on in

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,440
devops engagements I I worked in the US

66
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,680
for three years for for our devops

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,180
consultancy and one of the things that

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
um I always find weird at the time

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,739
because I didn't understand it

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,360
um but they would say if if they didn't

71
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,420
understand what the customer wanted

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,560
right they got on a call they they tried

73
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,599
to understand what the customer wanted

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,319
try to understand what they needed and

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,300
they just like either we don't know or

76
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,220
we think it's very different from what

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,840
they said right because that happens on

78
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,060
as well

79
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,879
um then they would they would parachute

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,099
me in to go figure out what what what

81
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,860
the customer needs because sometimes you

82
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,319
you if if we were doing very short

83
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,739
engagements with customers right so I

84
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,959
would have a weak Max with the customer

85
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,940
five days in those five days I have to

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,200
figure out what the customer needs and

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,299
deliver it

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,760
and it's not like we can extend it

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,780
because on Friday I fly out and on

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,060
Monday I'm at a different customer

91
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,760
somewhere else in the country so it all

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,920
has to be done within that time period

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:04,019
so how do you dynamically adapt to those

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,299
changing needs well you can't really

95
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,640
have that huge plan up front you have an

96
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,739
idea right you have an idea what you

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,379
need to do you have an idea what's going

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,120
on but once you hit the ground you have

99
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,120
to continuously adapt to what's going on
