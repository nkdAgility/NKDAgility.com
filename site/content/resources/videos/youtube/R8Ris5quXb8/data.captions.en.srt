00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,200
it's an awesome uh little uh class that

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,200
helps us get to grips with some of the

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,799
nuances of product backlog management

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,240
how do we make sure that we minimize the

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,719
amount of things that are in that

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,800
product backlog in order to maximize the

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,800
value that we get from it
