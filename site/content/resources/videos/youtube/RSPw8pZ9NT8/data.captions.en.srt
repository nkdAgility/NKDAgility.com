1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,900
so uh the kanban workshop is from uh

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,900
procamban.org

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,840
it's called the the APK applying

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,119
professional kanban

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,720
um and it's uh

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:31,579
really it's it's 16 hours of a deep

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,219
exploration of the

8
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,719
strategy that is devops

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,820
um so there there are other things out

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,260
there that are actual software processes

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,260
right

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:49,379
um but the core of kanban is this

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,300
strategy that allows you to

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,760
um or meta process that allows you to

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,500
monitor any existing process doesn't

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,140
matter what it is right your existing

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,539
process could be scrum your existing

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,120
process could be we've made it up as we

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,560
go along or your existing process could

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,540
be uh Maurice or ssadm or whatever thing

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,520
your organization's doing

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,180
the

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,700
kanban strategy would allow you to

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,960
observe and record what's going on in

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,840
that process you're effectively

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,140
monitoring the flow of work through that

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,840
system thus then you're looking at the

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,000
data right enabling you uh to

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,939
continually make tweaks and changes to

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,700
the system in order to optimize that

31
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,220
flow of value right so that's that's

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,700
that's that's really about that delivery

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,040
piece how quickly are we able to take an

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,140
idea that we get and get it

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,000
all the way into or all the way into

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,439
production potentially so that our our

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,020
customers can use it but it will model

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,820
any system I think that's that's the key

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,299
piece for me

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:02,159
um is the the it models any system and

41
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:06,600
any part of any system right so even if

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,660
you had a a team that's just looking at

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,840
you know their view or their area of

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,580
control is uh from when the product

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,739
owner gives them a feature of the

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,560
business gives them a feature to to to

47
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,620
when they've sent it off to the

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,660
operations team right that could be that

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,900
could be one view so you're looking at

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,260
the cycle time across these two points

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,379
doing the report item aging controlling

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,760
your whip in it at that level but your

53
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,459
business could be looking at a much

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,560
higher level right instead of individual

55
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,019
pieces of value that a teams

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
working on going through the system your

57
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,420
business could look at all of the

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,700
Endeavors that are underway and what is

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,260
there from when they come up to it from

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,519
when it's actually delivered and what is

61
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,260
their throughput what is their cycle

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,200
time what's their current whip what's

63
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,879
the capability of the organization and

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,620
this is especially true in in things

65
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,599
like Professional Services right where

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,099
you get gigs coming through and you're

67
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,780
trying to service them with the people

68
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,420
that you've got and you don't want to

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,920
end up in that death spiral of you know

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,840
we've got more people so we need more

71
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,599
gigs and then we've got more gigs so we

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,700
need more people and you end up in a

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
spiral of reduction in quality because

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,940
you've got to hire people because you

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
need them not because they're the right

76
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,420
people to hire

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,200
um and that's true for big organizations

78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:32,040
as well so so this allows you to model

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,920
the flow of value through any two points

80
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,560
um and really improve the way you work

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,019
because you're able to monitor what's

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,599
going on and that's that's what the the

83
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,459
APK applying professional Kombat is all

84
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,120
about so whether whether you're a team

85
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,420
right and you're looking to improve your

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,220
your engineering excellence and shorten

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,920
the cycle time get value through your

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,200
system quicker or you're doing scrum

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,780
you want to improve

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,280
throughput in your system or you're a

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,959
leadership team and you're looking at

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,980
the work that's underway across multiple

93
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,739
teams it it really doesn't matter what

94
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,040
the system is this is the tool that you

95
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,260
need uh to monitor the data analysis

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,060
that you need to monitor not just the

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,100
flow value through the system but then

98
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,620
look forward into the future and do

99
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,840
probabilistic forecasting on what's

100
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,000
coming up next how long do we think

101
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,520
things are going to take and How likely

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,560
is that to happen right if we're

103
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,860
thinking in bets

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,300
and really looking at the the data from

105
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,919
what we've delivered in the past if we

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,080
have a stable system right you need a

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,259
stable system first then we can start

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,940
looking out into the future using using

109
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,699
effectively some of the same tools that

110
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,860
that when you see them talking about the

111
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,840
weather on TV right

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,820
um there there they say that on on

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,620
Thursday at three o'clock it's going to

114
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,720
rain right that's their their their

115
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,520
prediction and then it'll have a

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,100
percentage likelihood of that to happen

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,479
and let's say it's 85 sure that's going

118
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,940
to happen

119
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,259
what they've done and for them it's much

120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,880
more complicated than what we were

121
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,699
talking about much more complicated

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,740
they've got these really complex models

123
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,860
that model the weather in whatever area

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,680
you're in right and they feed the data

125
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,500
from hist all of history that they've

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,699
got Plus what's currently happening in

127
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,620
the weather and they feed it into this

128
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,539
model and then they run the simulation

129
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,419
thousands and thousands and thousands of

130
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,160
times and what percentage of those

131
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,560
simulations does it rain at three

132
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
o'clock on Thursday well 68 of the

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,220
simulations it rains at three o'clock on

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Thursday well it might rain at three

135
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,919
o'clock on Thursday right it's 65 if

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,720
that's the number of simulation 65 sure

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,340
it will rain at three o'clock on

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,860
Thursday and that's the same thing that

139
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,199
we can do with our engineering processes

140
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,660
right we can look at

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,660
um what are historical delivery

142
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,780
um on average for example

143
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,820
um 85 of the time that's on average

144
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,660
that's the wrong Edward but 85 percent

145
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,840
of the time uh we deliver work in our

146
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,560
team uh let's say six days or less

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,240
so I'm 85 sure that any piece of work we

148
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,600
take on will be delivered in eight days

149
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,720
or less right so we can make that a

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,460
forecast looking into the future and put

151
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,319
it into a simulation and for that we

152
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,560
normally use a Monte Carlo

153
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,600
feed some data in run it 10 000 times

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,520
what's the chances of you delivering 10

155
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,500
things in the next Sprint 20 things 30

156
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,240
things what's the percentage likelihood

157
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,060
that's going to happen and then you can

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,759
have real conversations with your

159
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,979
stakeholders not about what you will and

160
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,740
What You Won't Do but what is the

161
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:50,100
likelihood of certain outcomes happening

162
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,979
with the clear understanding that there

163
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,380
is also no matter how

164
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,440
um high in the the percentiles you go

165
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,560
right you never get to a hundred percent

166
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,840
you can get to the 99th percentile right

167
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,580
but you can never get to 100 so there's

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,880
always a chance that something wouldn't

169
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,100
happen and that's a key learning outcome

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,139
for engaging with stakeholders for the

171
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,419
stakeholders and the teams communicating

172
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,039
with them that we want to be talking in

173
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,600
percentages we want to be talking about

174
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,699
probabilities

175
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,680
um with our with our stakeholders for

176
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,199
whatever it is we're doing How likely

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,919
are things to be successful just like

178
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,960
businesses have always done

179
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,759
