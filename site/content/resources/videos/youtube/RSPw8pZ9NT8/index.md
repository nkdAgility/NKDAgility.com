In my recent Kanban workshop with Procamban.org, titled "APK: Applying Professional Kanban," I had the opportunity to delve deep into the strategic underpinnings of DevOps. Over the course of 16 hours, we explored how Kanban serves as a meta-process that can be applied to any existing workflow, regardless of its nature. Whether your team is using Scrum, a homegrown process, or even something like SSADM, Kanban provides a framework to observe and enhance your current practices.

### Understanding Kanban as a Strategy

At its core, Kanban is about monitoring the flow of work through your system. This means you can effectively track how ideas transition from conception to production, ultimately delivering value to your customers. Here are some key takeaways from my experience:

- **Universal Applicability**: Kanban can model any system, allowing you to observe and record processes at various levels. For instance, a team might focus on the cycle time from when a product owner hands over a feature to when it reaches the operations team. Conversely, an organisation might look at the overall throughput of multiple teams.

- **Optimising Flow**: By monitoring the flow of work, you can make informed tweaks to your processes. This is crucial for improving delivery speed and ensuring that value flows smoothly through your system.

- **Avoiding the Death Spiral**: In professional services, it’s easy to fall into a trap where an increase in gigs necessitates hiring more people, which can lead to a decline in quality. Kanban helps you manage this by providing visibility into your capacity and workload.

### The Power of Data Analysis

One of the most exciting aspects of applying Kanban is the ability to leverage data for continuous improvement. By analysing historical data, you can forecast future performance with a degree of probability. This is akin to how meteorologists predict the weather. They use complex models and historical data to simulate outcomes, providing a percentage likelihood of events occurring.

- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Imagine being able to say, "Based on our past performance, there’s an 85% chance we’ll deliver this work in six days or less." This kind of insight transforms conversations with stakeholders from mere speculation to informed discussions about likelihoods and outcomes.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: To achieve this, we often employ Monte Carlo simulations. By running thousands of simulations based on historical data, we can assess the probability of delivering a certain number of items in the next sprint. This allows for more realistic planning and expectation management.

### Engaging with Stakeholders

The shift from deterministic to probabilistic thinking is a game-changer in how we communicate with stakeholders. Instead of making absolute promises, we can discuss the likelihood of various outcomes. This not only sets realistic expectations but also fosters a culture of transparency and trust.

- **Communicating Probabilities**: It’s essential to convey that while we can be highly confident in our forecasts, we can never reach 100% certainty. This understanding is crucial for effective stakeholder engagement and helps teams navigate the inherent uncertainties of software development.

### Conclusion

The "APK: Applying Professional Kanban" workshop reinforced my belief in the power of Kanban as a strategic tool for enhancing workflows across various systems. Whether you’re a team aiming to improve engineering excellence or a leadership group overseeing multiple projects, Kanban provides the insights needed to optimise your processes and deliver value more effectively.
