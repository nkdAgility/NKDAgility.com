# Can you talk about the Kanban workshop and why it's a great option for organizations

#scrum is a great solution for teams wanting to acquire an #agileframework to help navigate complexity in #productdevelopment. That said, some of the events and artefacts don't resonate with every team, and so #kanban has become an increasingly popular option for #productdevelopment teams that want to navigate complexity, grow agile capabilities, but don't want a #scrumframework in their environment.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the #kanban workshops that NKD Agility run, and how they can help your team adopt #agile or implement #agile more effectively.
