One of the great things for immersive learning for practitioners is that it combats cognitive bias. We tend to think we know more than we do about a particular topic. You wouldn't believe the number of people that participate in training, uh, agile training, that have been doing agile and scrum for a very long time, and they haven't read the Agile Manifesto and they haven't read the Scrum Guide. The Dunning-Kruger effect; they think they know more, uh, than they do. So the power in immersive learning is we continuously whittle away. Um, they can't escape the idea that we know less than we discover by doing. Um, and in order to be doing more, we need that focus.
