1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,319
one of the great things for immersive

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,000
learning for

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:12,519
practitioners is that it combats

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,160
cognitive bias we tend to think we know

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,720
more than we do about a particular topic

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,720
you wouldn't believe the number of

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,080
people that participate in training uh

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
agile training that have been doing

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,039
agile and scrum for a very long time and

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,039
they haven't read the agile Manifesto

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,039
and they haven't read the scrum guide

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,439
the Dunning Krueger effect they think

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,239
they know more uh than they do so the

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,559
power in immersive learning is we

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,480
continuously Whittle away um they can't

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,399
escape the idea that we know less than

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:49,399
we discover by doing um and in order to

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,399
be doing more we need that Focus
