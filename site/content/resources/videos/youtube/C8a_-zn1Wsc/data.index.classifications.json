    "reasoning": "The content focuses on immersive learning, cognitive bias, and continuous improvement within Agile and Scrum. There are detailed discussions on hands-on practice, feedback, and growth, but these are about individual and human team learning, not about humans collaborating with AI agents or hybrid intelligence. There are no explicit or implicit references to AI-human partnership, collective intelligence, or socio-technical systems featuring AI. The depth, alignment, and intent marginally touch on group/team learning but fall short of the category definition.",

It does not address or imply human-AI collaboration or the emergence of collective intelligence as defined. Relevance to the 'Collective Intelligence' category is minimal.",

It refers to setting goals, focus, and reflection, but never mentions OKRs, their structure, or core concepts like Objectives and Key Results. No references to John Doerr or 'Measure What Matters' appear. Discussions of goal clarity or continuous improvement do not connect explicitly to OKR theory, language, or practices. The content is well-aligned with Agile audiences but wholly unrelated to OKRs.",

While it addresses practitioner agency and continuous feedback, it does not explicitly discuss the deliberate design of engineering practices, decentralization of decisions, AI collaboration, or DevOps-infused engineering—the hallmarks of Agentic Engineering. There are no direct mentions of agentic concepts in title, description, or body. Audience and signal are high due to technical targeting, but conceptual alignment and depth are weak regarding Agentic Engineering per the strict definition.",

There are no direct or indirect references to AI agents, contextual intelligence, agency, modern engineering practices, or the integration of autonomous systems as defined by Agentic Software Delivery. Although the target audience overlaps (Agile practitioners), and the structure is focused on continuous improvement—a tangential theme—it completely lacks alignment with the central principles or purposes of the Agentic Software Delivery category. The signal-to-noise is moderate (clear, but off-topic), and no content is outdated or critical of agentic framing. Minimal scores are given for audience and signal due to practitioner overlap, but otherwise the fit is extremely weak.",
