No part of the content addresses SLE definition, calculation, purpose, or practice. While the audience (startup founders interested in Scrum) might overlap, the content does not mention or imply SLE in any way. Minor scores reflect the broad audience match and a single brief mention of 'agile' and 'scrum' in an invitation to connect, but nothing in substance; hence all major dimensions are close to zero. There is no outdated or contradictory material, so no penalties apply. Final confidence is extremely low to reflect nearly nonexistent SLE relevance.",
