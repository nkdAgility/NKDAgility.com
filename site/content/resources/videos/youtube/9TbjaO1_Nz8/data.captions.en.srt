1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,540
I would definitely recommend the the PSP

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,780
Auto and entrepreneur

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,180
um I invite the advanced pspo as well

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,539
but the the

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,680
that that key focus on value

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,760
from the from the pspo and what add your

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,520
product management looks like

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,180
are all key things that an entrepreneur

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,579
needs to bring into their way of doing

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,280
things their story of how how things

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,140
happen for them because usually

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
especially for entrepreneurs their

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,460
organizations are very small especially

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,980
at the start and they're going to be

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,879
fulfilling the role of product owner and

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,280
they're going to set the tone for

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,860
leadership and product management inside

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,079
of their organization and even if later

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,820
on they're handing that torch off to

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,799
somebody else because they're they're

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,600
being successful they're making good

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,560
decisions and then they're getting a

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,840
little bit bigger and they're able to

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,140
hand that torch off

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,460
that torch needs to come with uh here's

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,320
what we're trying to achieve here's

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,420
where we're going yes we have really

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,520
thought about value and I think it's

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,259
even more important for an entrepreneur

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,299
because you want to get past that

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,560
startup phase

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,360
um and I don't know what percentage of

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,799
organizations fail I don't know the

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
exact percentage of organizations

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,479
startups that fail but it's most of them

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,900
right most startups are going to fail

37
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:42,119
and one of the reasons that they fail is

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,159
that they don't have that tight focus on

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,040
value they don't understand what's value

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,259
what's value to their customers and they

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,659
haven't had those conversations written

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,079
it down understand it discussed it and

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:59,220
we have loads of tools in the product

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,460
owner class that you can use as part of

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,619
that story how how do I figure out what

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,960
those things are how do I think about

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,200
those things in order to bring everybody

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,640
in my in my team along with me and help

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,860

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,900
achieve
