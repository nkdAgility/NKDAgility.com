00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
dictatorship vs democracy dictatorship

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:11,880
is absolutely fantastic for um getting

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,039
getting what you want

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,960
done the difficulty is what you want is

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,840
not necessarily what everybody else

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,240
wants and it's not necessarily what the

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
right thing is and what we've kind of

00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,800
the middle someone someone to to to to

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,559
set strategic Direction um and then a

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,239
bunch of folks who are going to

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,239
collaboratively work towards

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,239
