Dictatorship vs Democracy. Dictatorship is absolutely fantastic for getting what you want done. The difficulty is what you want is not necessarily what everybody else wants, and it's not necessarily what the right thing is. What we've kind of found, lots of papers and research around this, is that groups of people collaborating towards a common goal come up with better ideas than one individual specialist alone. So democracy versus dictatorship is probably more somewhere in the middle; someone to set strategic direction, and then a bunch of folks who are going to collaboratively work towards it.
