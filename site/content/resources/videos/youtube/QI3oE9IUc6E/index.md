# How effectively does an APS prepare a team to do solid, professional scrum

There's #scrumtraining that will help you understand the theory of the #scrumframework or a specific accountability like a #scrummaster, and there's other #scrumtraining that helps you embed the learning and improve as a #scrumteam.
