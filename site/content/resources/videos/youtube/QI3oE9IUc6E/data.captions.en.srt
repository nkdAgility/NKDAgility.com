1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,040
the EPS

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,820
prepares a team for professional scrum

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,779
and by really doubling down on those

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,600
core fundamentals of of scrum you you

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,400
must have working usable product at the

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,180
end of every iteration including the

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,699
first

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,199
if you don't we're we're not at does

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,699
there's no agility there if we don't

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,740
have working usable products right

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,079
because we need to be able to test and

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,360
get feedback from that

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,059
um what else is really important from

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,000
the EPS that

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,219
so many one of I think the most powerful

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,340
features of the aps which is why it

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,780
actually is super effective for existing

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,020
teams as well like teams that are

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,079
already doing scrum is that level set of

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,420
what is and is not scrum

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,760
right so quite often in our organization

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,400
we pick up scrum we learn scrum we've

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,220
been doing scrum for a little bit within

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,040
our organization and it picks up a bunch

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,420
of barnacles I don't know well I go with

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,659
a sailing metaphor yeah let's go with

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,960
the ceiling metaphor uh my brother sales

28
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,000
uh he does races across the channel in

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,659
the in the UK from from

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,759
um England over to France

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,979
um I don't I think he's come second once

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,439
but you know it's it's these are these

33
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,400
are really really heavy races

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,360
um and the the the thing anything that

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,340
goes in the water that slows down the

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,400
bolt that slows down the stream of water

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,259
because he's dragged right and even the

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,320
smallest amount of drag can severely

39
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,500
impact over uh over over a race the the

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,619
impact of of your place

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,159
um and Barnacles are the bane of the of

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,180
the of ships not ships sailboats boats

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,979
ships

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,240
you can tell I'm not an expert sailor

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,000
right but

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
um the the the the Barnacles get on the

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
side and then they cause cause drag

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,500
that's what happens when you've been

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,940
doing scrum for a while in your

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,340
organization it picks up a bunch of

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,920
barnacles right stuff that gets stuck

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,379
onto it at some point because

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,900
you needed to solve a problem because

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,640
your organization didn't do things in a

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,440
way that was as effective as it could be

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,020
so we have to stick this thing into

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,660
scrum maybe that thing was user stories

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,280
or story points or maybe that thing was

59
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,980
I don't know we're gonna have a burn

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,379
down or it could be some other report

61
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,300
that your organization really really

62
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,519
really wanted so you had to capitulate

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,440
for and then it's just kind of stuck

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,220
there and maybe it's outlived its

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,099
usefulness but we think we as a team

66
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,379
think of it as part of that overall

67
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,239
package because when we say scrum within

68
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,459
our organization

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,260
that's what we mean the whole package

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,140
including all the Barnacles that we've

71
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,920
we've had attached to our process so the

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,980
EPS is a great place uh to come and

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,980
scrape off those Barnacles right

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,680
um what are the things that are and are

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,900
not core to scrum because everything

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,060
else is a choice so how do we

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,060
disambiguate the choices that we've made

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,220
from scrum itself so that perhaps

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,580
there's other choices that are maybe

80
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,099
more effective now than they were before

81
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,959
um so there's there's a key one of my

82
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,400
favorite exercises at the end of the

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
class

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,140
um is is where can we I kind of have a

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,220
choice and I let teams decide the groups

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,780
decide

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,519
um but they can either do a kind of

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,560
getting started because we're not doing

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,000
scrum and we want to figure out how do

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,220
we get started doing scrum in our

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,340
organization and then there's a kind of

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,519
Barnacle Barnacle exercise right which

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,379
is uh how do we improve like a like a

94
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,260
little retrospect active on our

95
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,959
implementation of scrum to start at

96
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,459
least identifying the Barnacles that we

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,440
have in our scrum process within our

98
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,239
organization and then figuring out how

99
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,519
to how to address them a little bit

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,860
right that's a that's a great exercise

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,480
and if we do it privately within

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,879
organizations there's an additional

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,840
exercise that I run which is the people

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,720
in the class create an organizational

105
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,639
change backlog like what needs to be in

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,740
an organizational change backlog to make

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,020
scrum successful or more successful or

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,460
valid within our organization

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,040
um and really it's an agile

110
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,660
transformation backlog from the people

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,699
who are actually doing the work right

112
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,080
what are their problems going to be and

113
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,759
hopefully there's leadership available

114
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,259
who are able to take ownership of that

115
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,880
and take it forward

116
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,560
so we do that mainly in the private

117
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,060
classes not so much in the public ones

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,320
right because it doesn't make sense if

119
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,759
you get 20 people from 20 different

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,900
companies

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:57,479
that is how the aps effectively prefers

122
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:59,400
teams to be professional scrum teams

123
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,199
