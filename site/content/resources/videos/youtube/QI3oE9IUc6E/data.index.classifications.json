    "reasoning": "The content centers on the Applied Professional Scrum (APS) as a means for teams to excel at Scrum by returning to fundamentals and removing outdated practices. There is no explicit mention or substantial discussion of the Definition of Workflow as described in Kanban or agile theory. While there is some reference to 'organisational change backlog' and practices that impact how teams work, the main thrust is about professionalization, removing extraneous practices, and focusing on delivering working products, rather than articulating explicit workflow agreements, entry/exit criteria, WIP limits, or visualizing and adapting workflow per Kanban principles. The language and approach target Scrum practitioners, but not those specifically interested in the Definition of Workflow; thus, conceptual alignment, depth, and relevance are all quite low. No dimensions warranted penalties; the content is not critical or outdated.",

The term 'Product Developer' is never mentioned, nor are key behaviors or responsibilities unique to the role.

All collaboration references are strictly within human teams. The main ideas and audience partially overlap with Collective Intelligence (as both target improving teamwork in socio-technical settings), but the absence of AI in any collaborative or agentive capacity means minimal alignment and depth. The discussion is relevant to agile practitioners, providing insight into professional Scrum mastery, but offers no substance on the defining topics of human-AI partnership or sociotechnical augmentation with AI.",

The article never mentions Agentic Engineering or its unique philosophical underpinnings (decentralized decision-making, DevOps-infused craft, ethical AI). The discussion sticks to practical application of Scrum fundamentals, not the deliberate design of agency-maximizing environments or systems that involve collaboration with intelligent systems or ethical automation.
