debt Every time you skip quality

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,040
standards every time you fudge what done

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,480
means you're not saving time You're

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,600
creating future rework A weak definition

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,320
of done means your increment isn't truly

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,359
usable It means production risks hidden

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,400
failures and uncertainty It means you

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,760
can't trust what you've built At Naked

Agility we help teams create a strong

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
enforcable definition of done ensuring

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,160
every increment is shippable usable and

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,480
backed by real evidence Not just built

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,000
but delivering real insights Not just

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,680
working but meeting organizational and

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,440
strategic goals Weak delivery isn't

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
about missing features It's about

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,719
missing outcomes missing feedback and

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,039
missing trust Ready to stop paying the

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
hidden costs of weak delivery
