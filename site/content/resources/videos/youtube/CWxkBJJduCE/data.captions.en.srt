1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,759
test D driven development is not about

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,480
building better code it's about having

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,519
better architectures we create better

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,440
architectures because we only create

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,679
what we need to support the things that

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,000
we need it to do doing pair programming

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,680
means that we've got more eyes on the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,080
code it feels like it's going to be less

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,880
productive but productivity is not a

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,080
moment in time for the engineering team

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,120
it needs to be looked at across the

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,960
whole system and we can take uh what

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,280
seems like a a hit on productivity to do

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,640
pair programming because there's two

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,480
people doing things why can't we have

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,079
them both doing their own thing but we

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,360
have less problems that we need later

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
which are much more expensive than the

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,079
pair programming is at the at the start

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
right same with
