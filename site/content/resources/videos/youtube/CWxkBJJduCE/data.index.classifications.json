    "reasoning": "The content is entirely focused on the benefits and practices of test-driven development (TDD) and pair programming in improving software architecture and team productivity. There are no direct mentions or even implicit references to Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, application, or impact on Agile, Scrum, or Kanban workflows. No discussion of cycle time ranges, probability, or any flow metrics tied to SLE concepts is present. The alignment and depth are very low because the article never touches upon SLE, sticking only to developer-focused process improvements. The intent is to advocate for quality and maintainability through specific XP/Agile practices, not to inform readers about SLE or its value. The content is, however, targeted to a technical practitioner audience, which loosely overlaps with SLE's intended audience, but the signal is low for the specific category in question. The very low confidence score accurately reflects near-total absence of relevant category signals.",
