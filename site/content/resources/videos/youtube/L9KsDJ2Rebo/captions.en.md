So it's about the student's ability to take it in really. If you give them two full days, you know how long are they fully engaged in the class? Which bit do they remember? The bits that resonate right now, and then which bit are they going to put into practice straight afterwards? And while that's great and they're going to get a lot of information in there, the ability to spread it up, so for example with PSM over seven weeks means you've got seven opportunities to go and practice things and do things in your real work and not see it in this beautifully clean classroom environment. Let's say in your real work environment, the stuff you have to deal with after the class. 

So you get to see the real challenges and you get to see the real problems, and we can address that. Not only have you got access to a trainer throughout that time, there's a cohort group of people you can work with during the class, and who knows, even beyond if the groups decide to stay in touch with each other. And that will really get them engaged with it, and it'll be a bit more, I hate to say the word immersive, immersive in that you're actually doing it for real. And you know it's well named for that.
