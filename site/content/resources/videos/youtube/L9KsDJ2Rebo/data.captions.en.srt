1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,200
so

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,719
it's about the student's ability to take

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,240
it in really if you give them two full

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,580
days you know how long are they fully

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,380
engaged in the class which bid do they

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,240
remember the bits that resonate right

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,500
now

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,720
and then which bit are they going to put

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,980
into practice straight afterwards and

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,840
and while that's great and they're going

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,580
to get a lot of information in there the

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,759
ability to spread it up so for example

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,980
with PSM over seven weeks means you've

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,559
got seven opportunities to go and

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,379
practice things and do things in your

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,120
real work and not see it in this

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,360
beautifully clean classroom environment

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,219
let's say in your real work environment

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
the stuff you have to deal with after

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,600
the class so you get to see the real

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,020
challenges and you get to see the real

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,059
um problems and we can address that not

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,100
only have you got access to a trainer

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,739
throughout that time there's a cohort

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,660
group of people you can work with during

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,220
the class and who knows even Beyond if

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,380
the groups decide to stay in touch with

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,960
each other and that will really get get

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,460
them engaged with it and it'll it'll be

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,020
a bit more

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,939
I hate to say the word immersive

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,280
immersive in that you're actually doing

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,580
it for real and you know it's well named

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,580
for that
