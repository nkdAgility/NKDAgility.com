As a Professional Scrum Trainer (PST), Kanban Dan is focused on helping delegates acquire the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they need to shine in the workplace.

The 2-day Professional Scrum Master course does a great job of preparing newbie scrum masters, but the 7-week immersive learning experience offers a whole new dimension that ensures more skilled, knowledgeable, and practised scrum masters in the industry.

In this short video, Kanban Dan talks about the elements that most excite him about the new immersive learning journey through scrum.org and NKD Agility
