1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,680
so there's no such thing as a junior

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:11,040
scrum master I I I wrote this post

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:13,879
because I see and continuously

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,119
see a lot

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:19,119
of multiple things so I see a lot

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,080
of

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,760
organizations thinking that the scrum

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,279
Master can can be or teams right

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,480
thinking that scrum Master can be anyone

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,320
in the team and going well they're just

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,719
facilitating a few meetings so we will

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,840
just who's who's who's the least

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,200
productive on our team okay it's this

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,120
junior person I we'll pick them as the

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,480
scrum Master you go do this stuff and

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,120
that that that does that person and

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,160
themselves are complete disservice let's

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,320
tackled that one first right so that's

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,359
that's the first part of why why I I

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,480
wrote it the other part is on the scrum

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,160
Master site

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,000
that there is a

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
belief in the industry that if you want

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,960
to get into

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
it then a good way to do it is to come

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
in through the scrum Master because you

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,200
don't need to do anything

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,840
Technical and that for one of better

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,479
expression is total BS you you do need

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,079
to be Tech you need to be technical

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,960
within the context of the

32
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,920
team just like if you were wanted to

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,880
coach a

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,280
professional soccer

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,280
team you're probably football in my

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,000
words you're probably going to want to

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,560
understand the rules of the sport you're

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,439
probably going to want to understand the

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,520
Nuance of not just the sport itself the

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,520
the the the the the league tables how

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,479
you move between the leagues right the

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,280
the mechanics and the mechanisms of not

43
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,840
just the sport but the leagues and how

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,840
do you navigate your team

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,039
through through that story how how good

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,679
do the individuals need to be how well

47
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,920
do they need to work together how if how

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,239
do they they they they they thread that

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,080
needle of becoming a high performing

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,800
team in that league and perhaps going to

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,480
the next league if you can and maybe you

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
don't want to go to the next league so

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,440
maybe maybe you deliberately need to to

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,360
to lose a game right because you don't

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,760
want to go to you don't want to be

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
pegged High have to go to the next

57
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,000
league and then you'd be the bottom of

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,720
That League rather than the top of this

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,720
one all that kind of stuff the the the

60
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
understanding

61
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,599
of what we're

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,040
doing how we're doing it why we're doing

63
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,920
it and how we're going to get to where

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,519
we're we're going from a strategy

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,000
perspective so that's not the the in in

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,440
scrums perspective in in the perspective

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
of a of a of a scrum team

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,000
the the product owner is going to take

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,440
care of the the the what right I I I'm

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,760
pushing it off to the product owner the

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,519
whole scrum team takes care of the W but

72
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,840
the product owner has the has the

73
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,280
accountability um and we've got this

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,879
what that we're looking at but we've

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,080
also got

76
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,720
the the system that we're using and that

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,680
system that we're

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,439
using needs to be as effective as

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,599
possible so no matter what whats come

80
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,840
through the system we're able to deliver

81
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:40,599
them as quickly as possible and the

82
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,680
system the system coach the person who

83
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,439
is most focused on the system itself and

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,159
encouraging people to reflect on the

85
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,840
system itself and figuring out how the

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,879
system itself needs to change in order

87
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,280
to uh maintain that and how the systems

88
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,239
around that system need to change so

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,920
that could be things in the organization

90
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,799
or things and other teams that that

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,439
would enable us to be more effective if

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
they changed but is that good for the

93
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,319
overall system or just a a local

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
optimization which might be good for us

95
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,400
but negative for the rest of the system

96
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,880
how do we fit into that whole story that

97
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,400
that's not a that's not a junior who who

98
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,800
figures that out right that's somebody

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,400
with deep knowledge and understanding of

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,360
the type of work that the team does so

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,080
in my case that's usually engineering

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,400
teams they have deep technical knowledge

103
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,759
in the type of work that the product

104
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,800
owner does so the context of the

105
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,080
business right because the system has to

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
operate inside of a bigger system the

107
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,400
system of the team has to operate inside

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,360
of a bigger system that is the whole

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,199
organization so understanding the

110
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,440
systems of the organization and how we

111
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,560
navigate

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,960
that and then they they also need to

113
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,160
understand the the

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,280
the things that we see most which are

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,880
the the the the the tools and practices

116
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,800
around how do we actually do those

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,720
things so I I think too many people look

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,160
at the outcome and look at the tools

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,759
people used to get to the outcome and

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,479
they focus on the tools but they don't

121
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,120
focus on how did we pick that tool how

122
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
do we get to that tool and does that

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,360
tool continue to support our needs over

124
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,680
time

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,800
and that's the perview of the the scrum

126
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,039
Master they are they are a system system

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
mechanic there they're a mechanic for

128
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,039
the system and if you're going to be a

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,800
mechanic for a system you want to

130
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,319
understand the systems and that system

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,280
is made up of the way the team works the

132
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,000
capabilities of the team the knowledge

133
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
of the team is made up of the knowledge

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,720
of the product owner and what they're

135
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,479
picking and what direction they're going

136
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,360
and that informs what knowledge the team

137
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
might need in the future and we're

138
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,680
looking at the organization and what the

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,440
organization understands about the

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,440
system what the organization system is

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,120
it's just such a

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,400
big ball ball ball of worms that you

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,840
need somebody with significant expertise

144
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,000
significant history to be able to do

145
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,680
that so that's why I I use the phrase

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
there's no such thing as a junior scrum

147
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,199
Master there there is no such thing as a

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,680
junior Scrat Master just the same as

149
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,440
there's no such thing as a junior CEO or

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,919
a junior CIO the might be somebody who's

151
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,639
new to that role but how did they get in

152
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,440
that role they were selected they were

153
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,080
picked for their their

154
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,280
demonstrated skill and ability already

155
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,919
they they they they are didn't arrive

156
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,240
fully formed right that's um a little

157
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,240
bit of a misnomer I

158
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,440
I I think I think a good example is that

159
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,400
idea of a of of a of a of a gunny or or

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,360
in in in the military right a gunner

161
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,360
Sergeant there's no such thing as a

162
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,120
junor Gunnery Sergeant right you you you

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,720
have a person who demonstrates skill at

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,240
different levels and is promoted through

165
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,919
the ranks right and then they get to

166
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,680
that they're now a gunner Sergeant they

167
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,479
may be new to the role of gunnery

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,560
sergeant and have to learn things about

169
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,280
that role but they bring with them

170
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,680
significant skill and expertise in what

171
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,960
we're doing already they they already

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,080
you're not going to make General

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,039
Sergeant if you don't understand the

174
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,960
organizational structure if you don't

175
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,599
understand not just the the hierarchy

176
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,039
right but also that network of how you

177
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,639
actually get things done inside of the

178
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,960
context of the organizational structure

179
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,520
so there really is no such thing as a

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,240
junior Sun scr Master there's no root to

181
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,479
scrum Master for or should be no root to

182
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,840
scrum Master for somebody who doesn't

183
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,039
have any skills within the context of

184
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
the team because they're going to do the

185
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,159
team and the organization a disservice

186
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,400
they're not competent within that

187
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:21,800
context so my my advice for for people

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,479
who I I I'll use a concrete example I

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,919
had somebody set up a a meeting to have

190
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,879
a chat about becoming a a srum master

191
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,360
and they worked in accountancy they

192
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,279
worked for an in firm and they wanted to

193
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,839
to get into the like the idea of the

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
scum master that they'd heard about and

195
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,959
they wanted to get into that and my

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,399
advice to them was to to fight find a

197
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,440
team or a group inside of the world of

198
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,080
accountancy right so you already know

199
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,200
the context you hopefully you have some

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,880
skills in that context and and make them

201
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,399
try you

202
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,200
work while you're doing the work with

203
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,720
the team to enable them to be the best

204
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,959
team te anybody's ever seen within that

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,640
context and by pursuing that goal you

206
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,120
learn the the the the processes and

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,880
practices that are required within that

208
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,760
context of an account team doing

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,399
accounts what what are the actual

210
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,240
processes what are the systems that make

211
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:26,560
sense within that context how do I

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,680
educate the people on that team in that

213
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
group and The Wider organization on

214
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,839
those practices and convince people to

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,959
and that will build your skill and

216
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,720
eventually the people in your team and

217
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,279
the people in the organization will look

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,959
to you for those things because you have

219
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,959
demonstrated competence in them right if

220
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,160
they're looking to you for those things

221
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,959
you are the scum Master right you are

222
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,760
the coach you are that that that person

223
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,760
and you arrived at it almost you you

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,519
know you became it fully formed because

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,600
you've demonstrated that capability but

226
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,640
it took a long time to learn the things

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
you needed to go over that line and

228
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,399
become that thing and then yes you're

229
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,160
you're you're uh new scrum

230
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,120
Master but there's no such thing as a

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Junior scho Master
