1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,599
so the question is what can a leader

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,800
pragmatically do with a team that is

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,880
identified as the question is

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,000
incompetent right but identified as

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,800
deficient in some way um before you

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,640
resort to to any kind of firing there's

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,000
plenty of things to do um so you may you

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,800
may want to bring in you may want to

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,480
bring in training um training is a good

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
way to Broad

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
paced uh some knowledge across across a

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
group of people um they might not

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,719
remember everything that they learned

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:47,719
but I I do find um although we might

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:52,320
remember 20 25% of what we uh learned in

16
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,800
a in a class um we learn that 25% is

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,520
spread across all of the capabilities

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
that you maybe learned maybe there's 30

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,519
topics or let's say there's 25 topics

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,680
and you remember 1% of each of those

21
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,520
those topics um that that 1% of of the

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,720
total course in each of those topics

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,920
that you remember enables you to know

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,159
where to go look where to go find that

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,720
additional information um so as long as

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,280
um the people that you've got have some

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,280
kind of

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,040
um how would you describe it they

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,439
they're willing to to do things

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,320
themselves Discover right um then then

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,680
you can just broad paste some training

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,240
perhaps the um applying professional

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
scrum for software developers right uh

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
get some broad paste of these modern

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,399
engineering practices across the team at

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
least they're understanding them and

37
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,560
thinking about them and they can go do

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,439
additional research on those on those

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,840
topics and it shows commitment from the

40
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,920
organization on on on on updating uh but

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,280
if they're um already in

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,079
a I guess I would say dejected State um

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,399
I worked at a organization in the UK

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,319
another bank um and they had I I worked

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,039
beside somebody who believed themselves

46
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,120
to be unemployable because they hadn't

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,879
done anything new in four years um that

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
kind of depressive dejected their

49
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,440
already unhappy but don't know what to

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,920
do about it State you might find that

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,560
over time they learn not to learn right

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,319
they stop learning they stop figuring

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
stuff out cuz they're like why bother if

54
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm not going to be allowed to do

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,239
anything um so you need to you need to

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,480
build that back in slowly you need to

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,920
start encouraging them to learn new

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,680
things and it might not be that you

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,280
encourage them to learn you might say

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,800
you need to learn this new thing so we

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
can do this new capability I have them

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
learn the thing and then do the new

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,280
capability have them learn the thing do

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,319
the new capability suggest they learn

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,319
the thing drop in the new capability

66
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,720
right so then they're expected

67
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,120
to it has them have that feeling of if I

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,680
learn it I get value from it rather than

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,159
if I learn it I'll not get value from it

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
because nobody's going to let me use it

71
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,120
so you have to start building back in

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,879
that capability into the team into into

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,959
the whole organization right because

74
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,560
people don't get that way uh um out of

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,360
the box most people that I um have ever

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,519
worked with most teams most people that

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,799
I've ever worked with are interested in

78
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,560
learning more about their uh their field

79
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,360
unless the organization has beaten it

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
into them that they that they're not

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,519
going to be able to use anything they

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,200
knew they learned um I spent my early

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,120
career as a net developer uh hopping

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,159
between companies uh because I would I

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,120
would go to a company because they were

86
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,360
using net to um and then i' would be

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
working there for for a couple of years

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,599
um about halfway or three quarters you

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,879
know a year to 18 months in net 3 would

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,599
become available um and I'd be starting

91
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,840
to learn that technology and then asking

92
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,560
them so when are you going to use this

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,599
new technology and they' be like maybe

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,159
in 3 or 4 years and I'd be like okay I'm

95
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,040
job hunting then for somewhere that's

96
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,920
pulling in net 3 um and then I'm going

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,400
to go work with that not net 3 this.

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,400
net4 comes out I'm going to be learning

99
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,519
that new technology and then if my

100
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,479
organization isn't willing to change

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,840
then I'm going to change right change

102
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:29,759
your org or change your org and I think

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,600
um that continuous move into technology

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,680
maintained my ability to be employable

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,280
my ability to learn and grow my

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,280
knowledge and career and I personally

107
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,919
wasn't afraid to switch between

108
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,600
companies but lots of people are right

109
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,280
so it can be beaten out of them very

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,120
easily that was that was um um through a

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,199
number of organizations Investment

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,720
Banking as well as other other stuff but

113
00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:00,960
um you you you you need to create an

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,400
environment within which people are

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,280
rewarded that doesn't mean financially

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,560
but rewarded for learning new things and

117
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,160
figuring out new ways to do things do

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,240
you give people the freedom to try stuff

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,840
out do you give them the freedom to fail

120
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,400
right doing something about doing new

121
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,720
stuff is you might find things that

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,080
don't work right well yes we can do it

123
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,560
this way no okay well this bit doesn't

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,400
work we're down a dead end we need to

125
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,400
backtrack a bunch and then go down a

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,919
different route and there's some waste

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,280
in that but the waste that you get from

128
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,840
that is often

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,240
overshadowed by the clever and

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
interesting ways that you solve those

131
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
problems and the capabilities that those

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
ideas bring to the organization you

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,199
don't open out new markets new

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,560
capabilities get new users by just

135
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
staying in your lane you have to be

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,880
continually switching Lane and figuring

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,240
out what the best way to solve a problem

138
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,800
is so if you have a team uh that you you

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
take over as a product product owner or

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
as a development manager or any way you

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,400
come into contact in leadership with a

142
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,039
with a team if it feels like they're

143
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,759
they're not they don't feel they're

144
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,120
allowed to learn that they're allowed to

145
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,120
use new things that they're allowed uh

146
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
to do

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,479
stuff you need to fix that problem in

148
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,919
your organization fix the system and

149
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,360
then you'll start seeing a difference in

150
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,160
the teams you'll start seeing a

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,960
different uh Vibe a different k ability

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
a different interest in solving problems

153
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
