In any organization, the skills and knowledge of a team can determine its success or failure. But what happens when a team is identified as deficient? How do you as a leader address the issue before resorting to drastic measures like firing? The answer lies in training and fostering a continuous learning environment.

## **The Power of Training** **üí°**

Before rushing to conclusions about a team's competence, **training** offers a powerful solution. It provides a broad foundation of knowledge that can enhance the skills of the entire group. However, it's important to recognize that not everything taught in training will be remembered. In fact, we might only retain 20-25% of what we learn in a class. But that 25% is spread across all the capabilities taught.

### **Key Benefits of Training:**

- **Exposure to multiple topics**: Even if a team only remembers a small percentage, they are at least introduced to key concepts.

- **Starting point for further research**: The knowledge gained in training enables team members to know where to find more information when they need it.

- **Demonstrates organizational commitment**: Investing in training shows employees that the organization is committed to their growth and success.

**Personal Example**: In my experience working with various teams, I've found that training acts as a catalyst for curiosity. Teams may not master every skill during the session, but they are more equipped to continue learning afterward.

## **Rebuilding a Dejected Team** **üõ†****Ô∏è**

However, there are cases where training alone won't solve the problem. What if your team has already become dejected or feels stuck in their roles? I've encountered situations where employees felt "unemployable" because they hadn‚Äôt learned anything new in years. When individuals stop learning, it‚Äôs often because the organization has made them feel like their efforts won't make a difference.

In such cases, the solution is not just training‚Äîit's about rebuilding confidence and encouraging continuous learning.

### **How to Rebuild a Dejected Team:**

1. **Slowly introduce new learning opportunities**: Don‚Äôt overwhelm the team. Start with one new capability at a time and allow them to see the value of what they've learned by applying it immediately.

3. **Create a feedback loop**: Ensure that for every new thing they learn, they have the opportunity to apply it. This reinforces the connection between learning and its practical benefits.

5. **Encourage small wins**: Success breeds confidence. Celebrate even the small victories to help rebuild morale.

**Personal Story**: I once worked alongside someone who had stopped learning because they believed they wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to use what they learned. Over time, we slowly reintroduced new capabilities to the team. By allowing them to immediately apply their newfound knowledge, we started seeing a shift in mindset and performance.

## **Adapting to Technological Evolution** **üîÑ**

As technology continues to evolve, staying stagnant is not an option. Early in my career, I worked as a .NET developer, constantly moving between companies that were adopting the latest technologies. When I realized that my current organization wasn‚Äôt willing to evolve with the latest version of .NET, I‚Äôd move on to a new company that was embracing change.

### **Why Continuous Learning Matters:**

- **Keeps you employable**: In a fast-paced industry, continuous learning is key to staying relevant. I maintained my employability by consistently learning and adapting to new technologies.

- **Leads to organizational growth**: When an organization fosters a culture of learning, it grows along with its employees.

If your team or organization is not adapting to new technologies, it may be time to reassess the situation. Encourage your team to embrace change, and if your organization won‚Äôt evolve, it may be time to look for one that will.

## **Fostering a Rewarding Environment** **üå±**

Learning should be rewarding, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean financial compensation. There are plenty of ways to reward your team for learning and growing without monetary incentives.

### **Ways to Foster a Rewarding Learning Culture:**

- **Freedom to try new things**: Allow your team the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and technologies. Even if they fail, the process of experimentation can lead to innovative solutions.

- **Freedom to fail**: Failure is an inevitable part of learning. What‚Äôs important is that your team feels safe to fail and learn from those experiences.

- **Celebrate successes**: When a team learns something new and successfully applies it, celebrate that achievement‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a small or significant victory.

**Example**: In my own career, I‚Äôve seen how allowing teams the freedom to fail often results in unexpected breakthroughs. Sure, there may be some dead ends, but the lessons learned along the way far outweigh the temporary setbacks.

## **Fix the System, Not the People** **üîß**

If you find that your team is disengaged or unwilling to learn, the issue may lie in the system, not the individuals. People naturally want to learn and grow. It's when they feel stifled or believe their efforts won‚Äôt be valued that they lose motivation.

### **Steps to Fix the System:**

1. **Assess the organizational culture**: Is there room for innovation and learning, or is the organization stuck in its ways?

3. **Encourage continuous improvement**: Make learning a priority and ensure that your team feels supported in their journey.

5. **Lead by example**: As a leader, demonstrate your own commitment to learning. Show your team that you‚Äôre also willing to evolve and grow with them.

**Advice**: As a leader, you have the power to fix the system that is holding your team back. Create an environment where learning is valued, and you‚Äôll see a shift in team morale and productivity.

## **Conclusion: A Learning Culture for the Future** **üìö**

Building a learning culture within your organization isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù feature‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for long-term success. Training is a great starting point, but it‚Äôs the continuous opportunities for growth, the freedom to experiment, and the safety to fail that will truly transform your team.

Encourage learning, adapt to new technologies, and fix the system when it‚Äôs broken. By fostering a culture of growth and innovation, you‚Äôll unlock the full potential of your team.

And remember, learning isn‚Äôt just about acquiring knowledge‚Äîit‚Äôs about applying it in new and exciting ways. If you enjoyed this blog and want to dive deeper into Agile, Scrum, or DevOps, feel free to reach out and book a coffee chat with me through Naked Agility ‚òï.
