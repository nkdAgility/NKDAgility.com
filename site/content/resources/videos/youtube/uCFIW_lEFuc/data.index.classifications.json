There is no exploration of historical cycle time data, discussion of SLE's two components (elapsed time range + probability), guidance for establishing SLEs, nor any references to authoritative works on SLE. The primary audience is Agile practitioners and leaders, which matches part of the category’s intent, but the overall content serves as a motivational critique of Agile anti-patterns without engaging with SLE as a concept.
