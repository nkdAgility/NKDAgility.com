1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:09,440
one of the seven deadly sins of agile is

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:12,160
sloth and this manifests in a number of

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
number of different ways with with teams

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,879
with

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,359
organizations uh with leadership all

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:23,519
over the place um one of the most common

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,080
um elements is just not bothering our

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,920
bothering our ARS actually doing the

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,960
things um that that that we say we're

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,200
going to do right we say we're doing

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,079
agile but we don't deliver working

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,280
product at the end of the Sprint we say

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,399
we're doing agile um but we have long

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
convoluted deployment processes which

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,640
are not in control of the developers we

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,000
say we're doing agile um but we don't

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,079
have an ordered backlog right all of

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,719
these things

19
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,199
are places where we say we're doing

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,160
something but really we're just kind of

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,920
lazy and line through our teeth in order

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,080
to not have to do the work perhaps it's

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,680
because somebody in leadership in the

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,840
organization has decided that thou shalt

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,240
do Agile and your product is not

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,560
particularly suited to that model

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,200
because it was built in a in a

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
traditional maybe it's got Mainframe and

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,759
all kinds of crazy stuff in there maybe

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
there are other reasons why it's not

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,840
viable within the the the confines the

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,439
structure of of of your organization the

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,439
system that you're in um but I would

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,240
much rather teams and people were honest

35
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,439
and

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,079
transparent with their companies and

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,920
their organizations about what they they

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,280
can and cannot do what isn't is not

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,799
agile um I really like there's a great

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,280
article

41
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:54,840
um called uh detecting agile BS uh from

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,840
the US Department of Defense and if you

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,920
search for it you will find

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,399
uh a great little workflow on it it's my

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,239
one of my favorite uh uh things that I

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:13,160
use in organizations so here are uh six

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,319
sloths uh things that organizations kind

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,879
of say they do um or pretend that

49
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,120
they're agile but they don't actually do

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,160
these things uh and this I think these

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,280
are great uh so first one is our teams

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,519
delivering working software to real

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,000
users every iteration including the

54
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,040
first and Gathering feedback that's like

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,760
that's like the first thing that's

56
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,599
almost agile in a nutshell are we coming

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,120
up with ideas getting those ideas in

58
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,040
front of customers and getting that

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,360
feedback if you're not doing that sloth

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,760
right you're you're you're you're not

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,280
able to get things done uh the second

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,159
one and because this is Department of

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Defense right uh is there a product

64
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,400
Charter laying down the mission

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,959
strategic goals and do all members of

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,680
the team

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,640
understand how they contribute right

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,640
that's absolutely key if how can we

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,319
expect people within the context of our

70
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,799
of our product of our teams of our uh

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,080
organization to make good decisions

72
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,599
about what it is uh that they need to do

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,280
if they they they they don't have all

74
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,959
the information they need right we're

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,480
we're hiring smart clever people and

76
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,480
then we're not empowering them

77
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,760
to do the things that they need to do

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,000
right we're not we're just not

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,640
empowering them um and that that's

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that's part of we need to communicate

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,120
with them and if you don't communicate

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with them sloth if you don't actually do

83
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,680
those things you're you're you're being

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,280
lazy right just do it uh third one is

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,879
feedback uh from users turned into

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,040
concrete work items um on Sprint

87
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,760
timeline shorter than one month right so

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,200
are you getting uh things in front of

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
your customers at least once per month

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,000
um and

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
those that that that shouldn't be that

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,319
hard right it shouldn't be that hard to

93
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,720
engage uh with your with your with your

94
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,120
customers get parts of your product in

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,759
front of your customers and then get

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,759
them to tell you what they think of it

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
right Gathering feedback from from from

98
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,280
those users that shouldn't be that hard

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,479
and if you're not doing it sloth cuz

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,080
it's not that hard you're just being

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,560
lazy uh uh one that I I already

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,000
mentioned a little bit H is the full

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,840
ecosystem of your project agile I.E

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,199
agile programming teams followed by

105
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,800
linear bureaucratic deployments is a

106
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,479
failure right why do you have linear

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,639
bureaucratic deployments after your

108
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,600
adual team have done the work yeah we

109
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,919
might be able to make working product in

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
two weeks but how long does it take

111
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,880
before that increment that two weeks

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,880
worth of work actually gets in front of

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,919
real users so that you can CL close

114
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,919
those feedback loops break down those

115
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,479
assumptions validate what it is that

116
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,919
you're creating that it is actually

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,080
value and and if that's too

118
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,520
long that's it's not agile if you look

119
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,479
at the agile Manifesto you you it

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,919
says ideally a shorter time frame but

121
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,880
only a few months uh between having an

122
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,800
IDE and getting it into into production

123
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,960
um that should be uh the case and then

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,039
the the the fifth one are teams

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
empowered to change their requirements

126
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,759
based on feedback the the people doing

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,240
the work should be able to change and

128
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,000
adapt the requirements that they're

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,840
creating in the system the things that

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,240
they're building we want to build more

131
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,000
of the right things and less of the

132
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,360
wrong things we want to maximize the

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,919
amount of work not done all of those

134
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,160
things require the people doing the work

135
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,280
to be able to delete add or change

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
things from the backlog as needed based

137
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,520
on those interactions that we've already

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,680
talked about with the customer and if

139
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,800
you're not doing that sloth right why

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,280
are you not doing that why is somebody

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
not addressing the problems of why you

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,479
can't do that if your organization is

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
saying we want to do Agile year we want

144
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,280
to get all the benefits oh but you you

145
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,319
can't change your requirements you have

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,000
to do everything that here's the 300

147
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,919
things we need you to do that's

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,720
fundamentally not agile welcome changing

149
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,039
requirements even late in development

150
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,360
these are just fundamental uh uh

151
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,919
principles of agility and then the last

152
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,800
one on the Department of Defense you

153
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,000
know not well known for being an agile

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,440
organization but um the last one on

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,599
their list is are teams empowered to

156
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,840
change their process based on what they

157
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,039
learn so not only changing the work that

158
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,199
they're doing but changing the way that

159
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,280
they're doing the work and why aren't

160
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,479
your teams empowered to do that well

161
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,800
because people more senior can't be

162
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,800
bothered with that they just want to buy

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
agile from some vendor install it and

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,280
then everybody just does it that way

165
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,080
that's that's not fundamentally how

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,280
agile Works agile is about the emergent

167
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,440
practices The Continuous change

168
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,160
emergence and adaption of our processes

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,720
practices and tools in order to be able

170
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,840
to maximize the value delivered to the

171
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,879
customer the stakeholder which maybe the

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,280
business themselves right and without

173
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,919
those abilities we can't do that that I

174
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:38,120
I I feel like these six things

175
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,120
absolutely impit omey that's not a

176
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:48,560
word are sloth right if you're not able

177
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,199
to do all of these things you're not

178
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
really that interested in moving towards

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,599
agility you're really not that

180
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,479
interested in doing those things it's

181
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,919
it's lazy it's inept get off your ass

182
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,680
and fix it

183
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,599
