If you're an organization that invests heavily in trainingâ€”especially if you're supporting a large number of people trying to step into the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master roleâ€”then immersive learning should be at the top of your list. Itâ€™s an investment that can dramatically increase your team's effectiveness. Unlike traditional training, where learning can quickly fade, immersive learning helps people **internalize** the knowledge and put it into practice immediately.

## Why Immersive Learning Outperforms Traditional Training

In traditional training, participants are bombarded with concepts and theories. You learn something new, then quickly move on to the next topic, and before you know it, you've forgotten 80% of what you just learned. At the end of a typical training, only a handful of actionable tips remain in your mind.

But here's the issue: while you might increase the overall **baseline knowledge** in your organization, how much of that training sticks? And more importantly, how much of it gets put into practice?

### The Key Benefit of Immersive Learning

Immersive learning goes beyond simply absorbing informationâ€”it ensures that participants **practice** what theyâ€™ve learned. This is where the real value lies. By giving your team **assignments** based on real-world scenarios, theyâ€™re able to close the loop on their learning. They donâ€™t just **learn**; they **do**.

Hereâ€™s how immersive learning achieves this:

- **Hands-on assignments:** Participants are given practical assignments that they can implement with their teams right away.

- **Closing the learning loop:** Teams return after completing their assignments to share their experiences and lessons learned.

- **Knowledge sharing:** Through collaboration, Scrum Masters can learn from each otherâ€™s successes and challenges.

## Closing the Learning Loop

In immersive learning, the loop isnâ€™t complete until knowledge has been applied. The concept is simple: you learn, you apply, and you reflect on the results. This method ensures that the learning sticks and becomes part of your daily practice.

Without closing this loop, the vast majority of training becomes lost in theory, never seeing the light of day in real-world scenarios.

Imagine this scenario: you attend a traditional [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) class, learn about the **[Definition of Done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}})**, but never actually implement it with your team. In immersive learning, youâ€™d take what you learned and go back to your team with a specific assignment: "Talk to your team and develop a **Definition of Done**." You then return to the next session and share how it wentâ€”what worked, what didnâ€™t, and how you might improve.

### Practical Assignments and Real-World Application

One of the most valuable aspects of immersive learning is the practical assignments. Letâ€™s take the example of the **Definition of Done**. Itâ€™s one of my favorite topics because it directly impacts the quality of the product youâ€™re delivering.

#### Example Assignment: Crafting a Definition of Done

A typical assignment might involve the Scrum Masters going back to their teams and facilitating a discussion around the **Definition of Done**. If your team doesnâ€™t have one, then the Scrum Masterâ€™s role is to help create one. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach they might follow:

1. **Talk to the team** about their current understanding of the **Definition of Done**.

3. **Facilitate a discussion** to define what "done" really means for the team and their product.

5. **Document the Definition of Done** and ensure it is clearly understood and agreed upon by the team.

7. **Put it into action** by ensuring that every story or task adheres to this definition moving forward.

If the only outcome from an immersive learning session was that all of your Scrum Masters returned with a well-crafted **Definition of Done** for their teams, that would be a massive win for your organization. Quality would improve across the board, and teams would have a much clearer understanding of whatâ€™s expected.

## Real-Time Feedback and [Continuous Improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}})

One of the biggest advantages of immersive learning is the real-time feedback. After completing their assignments, Scrum Masters come back to the next session and share their experiences:

- **What did you do?**

- **How did it go?**

- **What challenges did you face?**

By sharing their experiences, Scrum Masters get feedback not only from the **facilitator** but also from their **peers**. This collective learning experience enables teams to refine their practices in real time.

For example, letâ€™s say 12 Scrum Masters from the same organization take part in the immersive learning class. They each go back to their teams and work on creating a **Definition of Done**. When they return, some will have succeeded, while others may have faced roadblocks.

- **Why were some Scrum Masters more successful?**

- **What could the others learn from them?**

These are the kinds of questions that lead to breakthrough insights and improvements. By pooling their knowledge, Scrum Masters help each other tackle organizational challenges.

### Knowledge Sharing Across the Organization

This knowledge-sharing element is often overlooked in traditional training. Immersive learning creates an environment where teams can learn from each otherâ€™s experiences, both successes and failures. Itâ€™s common for one team to say, "Thereâ€™s no way we can implement that hereâ€”it just wonâ€™t work with our organizational constraints." Then, in the same session, another team might say, "We do this all the time and it works great for us." This sparks conversations and new ideas.

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Tip:** When one team discovers a way to implement a Scrum practice successfully within the bounds of organizational constraints, itâ€™s worth having a **cross-team discussion** to spread that knowledge. This is where the power of immersive learning comes into play.

## The Value of Immersive Learning for Your Organization

So, why should your organization invest in immersive learning over traditional training? The answer is simple: **effectiveness**. Immersive learning ensures that knowledge isnâ€™t just taught, but practiced, shared, and refined.

### Key Takeaways

- **Immediate application:** Teams apply what theyâ€™ve learned through practical assignments.

- **Continuous feedback:** Real-time feedback ensures that Scrum Masters can improve and iterate on their practices.

- **Collective learning:** Teams learn from each otherâ€™s successes and challenges.

- **Real impact:** Concepts like the **Definition of Done** become part of your organizationâ€™s DNA, improving quality and alignment across the board.

If your goal is to elevate the skills of your Scrum Masters and embed Scrum practices deeply within your organization, immersive learning is the way to go.
