1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,200
if you're an organization uh that buys

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,719
lots of training um especially if you

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,679
have a a large cader of people in your

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,920
organization that are are currently

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,830
trying to do the scrum Master

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,160
role then the most

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,480
[Music]

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,119
valuable purchase you could make is

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,599
immersive learning and the reason that's

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,600
much more valuable for your organization

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,200
is that that it gives the people in your

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,120
organization the ability to close that

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,000
loop on their learning so normally when

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
you're when you're training you you you

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,960
you you learn

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,559
something and then you learn something

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,440
else and then you learn something else

18
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,719
and then you learn something else and by

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,600
the time you get to the end of that

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,039
process you've probably forgotten 80% of

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
all of the things that came before and

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,760
maybe when you come out of that training

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,920
class there are few things uh a

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,080
actionable things right those those

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,119
hints and tips and topics and uh stories

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
and how to there's only maybe a few of

27
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,479
those you can actually try you you've

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
increased the level of Baseline

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,200
knowledge in your organization right

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,920
everybody now understands perhaps what

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,200
scrum is and what a scrum Master is and

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,000
but have they actually

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,360
internalized any of those learnings and

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,759
how much of those learnings are they

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,320
actually able to put into practice and

36
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,079
the key value additional value in

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,640
immersive learning is in allowing the

38
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,520
people in your organization to actually

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,240
put the things into practice and we

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,880
enable that in the form of

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,280
assignments so each each uh uh person in

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,040
the in the class is given an assignment

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,920
it's probably the same assignment for

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,600
everybody but if you've got a bunch of

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,039
scrum Masters you're coming bringing to

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,560
the class they're going to go off into

47
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,079
their teams with their either with their

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,079
teams or with their leadership or um um

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
in in that area in that context and

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,920
they're going to try one of these things

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,720
one of these exercises so an assignment

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,280
might be oh I'm trying to think of what

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,440
what what a what a an example assignment

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,840
might be uh my favorite topic is

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,000
definition of done quality are we

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,800
creating enough quality in a product and

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,080
one of the assignments might be to go um

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,319
talk to the team and ask them about

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,519
their definition of

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,400
done and if they don't have a definition

61
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,640
of done help them create one and put it

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,000
into action that could be an assignment

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
for a scrum Master to do and if the only

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
thing that came out of the entire class

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
was that all of your scrum Masters all

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
of your teams had a definition of done

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,480
and it was actually actualized then that

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,080
would be a a a a total Boon for your

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,120
entire organization in in enabling that

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,400
level of quality uh but that's just one

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,440
of the exercises um that we might do one

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,720
of the assignments that the teams might

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,680
get and not only do they do the

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,560
assignment right but they come back at

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,519
the beginning of the next session and

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,879
they explain what did you do how did it

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,200
go what were the problems that you ran

78
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,599
into closing that learning loop again

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,200
and um figuring out well you didn't get

80
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,400
the outcome that you

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,239
wanted here are some other things you

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,319
can try and that can come from both from

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,000
the the facilitator of the debrief right

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,599
but also from the other people in your

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,920
organization who've actually done that

86
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,840
thing inside of your organization if you

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
bring 12 scrum Masters to a training

88
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,879
class and those 12 scrum Masters all go

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,519
and try and do this definition of done

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,360
some of them will be successful and some

91
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,799
of them won't some of them will be very

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
successful and some will only be a

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,360
little bit successful right

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,640
so why were certain scrum Masters

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,000
successful why were other ones not how

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,280
do we bring that knowledge together so

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that they can they can assess for

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,639
themselves what other ways to do things

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,280
CU because quite often I I've done a lot

100
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,639
of

101
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,400
um private training classes and you find

102
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,800
that even inside an organization one

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
person will say no there's no way you

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
can do this thing it's not possible

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
within our organization and then there's

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,000
somebody over in the in the in one of

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,440
the side videos will go we do it our

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,280
team does that and we do it very well

109
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,240
and we do it within the bounds of the

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,520
organizational constraints and then the

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,479
other person like holy crap how do you

112
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,479
do that who do you speak to how can we

113
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,199
get some of that as well and even that's

114
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,560
that sharing of knowledge we've tried

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,600
something it works here it doesn't work

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,560
here and closing those feedback loops

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,520
bringing those conversations together

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,199
are

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,880
are

120
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,759
the whole reason that the immersive

121
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,600
learning classes are going to be much

122
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,600
more beneficial to organizations than

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
the traditional approach if you want to

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,880
have a discussion about how immersive

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,240
classes can revolutionize your training

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,039
experience then please book a call on

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,560

to hear from you
