1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
when we're engaging with

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,599
customers especially new customers one

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,519
of the things we we we try and be 100%

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:14,000
clear

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:18,160
on is that we're not going to solve your

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,519
problem all of the messes all of the

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,160
issues are yours to

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:31,160
fix but what we can

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:34,000
do is we can um help you see the problem

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,160
s and keep a little bit of focus on

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
those problems so that you can solve

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,440
them right we're we're we're bringing

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,440
the Torches so that we can see what's

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,280
going on shine a light in those those

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,719
dirty Corners where are the under the

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,199
rug where we've been sweeping uh um the

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,239
dust right and point at that and say

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,280
look we need we need to resolve this

19
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,160
this is causing you problems this is

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,479
slowing you down this is costing you

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,880
money right and help those organizations

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:13,000
um Get Better by helping them figure out

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,840
like what are your options quite often I

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,200
I think it's it's really

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,720
interesting how

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,000
many

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,040
organizations and

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
Engineers I'm going to include engineers

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,520
in this because I think it's true there

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,520
too um

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,960
we tend to not get a lot of

32
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,119
training right you don't I don't see

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,159
organizations sending their Engineers on

34
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,560
coding courses I don't see them sending

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,280
them on product courses I don't see them

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,960
sending them on API courses I don't see

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,600
them sending them on security courses I

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,759
don't see them sending they don't they

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,640
don't do that so almost everyone of your

40
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,439
engineers is self-taught

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,640
right and when you're self-taught

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:08,520
you learn something within the bounds of

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,920
what you looked at and we stop looking

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,959
when we find an answer right it's like

45
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,440
when you're looking for your keys in

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,080
your house right if you've lost your

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
keys and you're looking for them you

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,920
don't find your keys and then keep

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
looking right you don't find them and go

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,360
I think I'll look a little bit more in

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,560
case I find more keys No I found them so

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to stop looking right so

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,480
they're always in the last place you

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
look and that same is true for knowledge

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,000
when we find an answer most of us stop

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
looking and use that answer but perhaps

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,879
there are five better

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,760
answers perhaps there are five

59
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,519
progressively better answers that we

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,480
could be finding and that's the value of

61
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,280
bringing in sometimes somebody from the

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,800
outside to look at what it is you're

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,800
doing and how you can be more effective

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,360
at it is that experience knowledge and

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,799
experience I've been doing devops

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,920
probably the best way to describe it

67
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,599
doing devops before it was since before

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,200
it was called devops was called

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,080
application life cycle management uh

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,360
before then and I've I've been looking

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,040
at that for for 20 years um I've been a

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:27,040
software engineer for 20 years I've been

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:30,560
a a a scrum coach and consultant for 10

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,239
years seeing what all of these

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,000
organizations out there are doing and

76
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,879
seeing the things that work for them and

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
the things that don't cuz not every

78
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,439
organization does everything well they

79
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,879
might do some stuff well and other stuff

80
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:49,840
not so much right um means that we can

81
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,120
bring a whole bunch of

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,840
ideas have you thought about this have

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,799
you looked over

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,239
here here's a tool that you could use to

85
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
get you started in the

86
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
space Oh if that tool doesn't work for

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,599
you here's the type of tool you're

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,040
looking for right and that provokes

89
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,519
people to go look for Alternatives look

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,680
for other ways to do things look for

91
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,120
Solutions and perhaps they'll find their

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,360
own ones that are even better than the

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,800
ones that we came up with but that

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,639
process is something that you and your

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,160
people have to do so when you're

96
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:36,000
engaging um as for devops we're going to

97
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,880
help you understand where you are right

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,039
now um help work with you to understand

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,840
what direction you want to

100
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:48,479
go and help you keep moving in that

101
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
direction but it's you and your people

102
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,320
that have to do the work because it's

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,320
you and your people that have to learn

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,960
the things institutionally you know that

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,960
um institutional knowledge that an

106
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,880
organization gets that when you bring in

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,520
new people although they come in with

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
their own ideas they learn that

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,880
institutional knowledge you want that

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,400
institutional knowledge to be moving in

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,320
that direction right the the the weight

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,800
of progress is in the direction that you

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,680
want to go which is

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,600
not building up a whole bunch

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
of refinement and work you've not done

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,400
it's doing those things and doing it

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,479
properly and not actually doing things

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:39,000
well well and we can help you keep

119
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,000
progress in those directions
