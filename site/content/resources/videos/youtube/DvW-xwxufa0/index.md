# Can you walk us through your consulting process What methodologies and tools do you employ?

Introduction: The Limits of Self-Taught Learning

- The Knowledge Trap: When we teach ourselves, we often stop learning as soon as we find an answer. It's like finding your keys—you stop searching once you've found them. But what if there are better answers out there?
- The Search for Better Solutions: The risk with self-taught knowledge is that we may miss out on better solutions simply because we stopped looking once we found something that works.

 🔍 The Value of Experience and Continuous Learning

- Decades of Experience: With 20 years in software engineering and 10 years as a Scrum coach and consultant, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t across various organizations.
- DevOps Evolution: Having been involved in DevOps since it was known as Application Lifecycle Management, I’ve witnessed its growth and transformation firsthand.
  
  🔄 Continuous Learning: Unlike the self-taught approach where learning stops after finding a solution, continuous learning involves constantly seeking out better methods, tools, and practices.

 💡 Diverse Knowledge Brings Better Solutions

- Organizational Insights: Not every organization excels in every area. By working with a variety of companies, I've gathered a wealth of insights into what works well and what doesn’t.
- The Power of Perspective: Bringing in different ideas from multiple sources can lead to discovering better solutions that you might not have considered on your own.
  
  💡 Ask More Questions: Have you thought about this? Exploring additional possibilities can lead to significant improvements.
