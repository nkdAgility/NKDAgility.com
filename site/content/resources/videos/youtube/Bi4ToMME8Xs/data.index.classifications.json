There are no explicit mentions, nor does the content engage with philosophical or deliberate design aspects related to maximizing agency; the focus is on general agile skill improvement. While the audience (practitioners and organizations) could potentially overlap, the scope is too broad to assume alignment. Depth remains superficial, with no nuanced discussion of agentic development concepts.",
