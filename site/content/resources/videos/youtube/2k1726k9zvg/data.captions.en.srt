1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,460
oh I kind of like that question what's

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,280
the difference between a newbie scrum

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,620
master and a professional scrum master I

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,340
I feel like neither of

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,900
um

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,420
I feel like neither of those things

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,100
exist right I think that's that's that's

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,199
where I would go initially and I would

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,000
say that there's no such thing as a

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,060
newbie scrum master

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,480
you you become a scrum Master because

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,239
you've demonstrated that competence

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,640
um in in your team to be able to help

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,040
them be more effective right so you're

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,899
not really a newbie you're just picking

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,660
up that accountability of the scrum

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,700
Master you are an experienced uh

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,460
effective professional at that point

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,200
when you pick up the accountability of

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,940
the scrum master so I feel like that

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,980
that newbie is a bit of a bit of a thing

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,719
and really there's the there's no such

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,579
thing as a professional scrum Master

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,260
that's just a scrum master

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,420
right just as there's no such thing as a

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,960
newbie scrum Master a professional scrum

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,760
Master is is scrum.org's brand of how

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,380
they explain things

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,820
but if you look at the scrum guide it

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,119
doesn't talk about professional scrum

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,159
master or true scrum master or certified

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,200
scrum Master right doesn't talk about

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,060
any of those things because there is

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,100
just the scrum master

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,080
and I think

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,780
um

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,360
if we were to look at professional scrum

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:33,380
master and see well what is it it's

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,380
trying to create that idea around

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,000
we need to approach the role of a scrum

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,920
Master From A A professional's

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,220
perspective it's it's not just we're not

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,180
just playing the scrum master we're not

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,180
just uh uh uh decking around as the

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,000
scrum Master where it's a professional

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,100
role that provides value to the

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,700
organization it provides value to the

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,640
team it's picking up accountabilities

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,840
that that perhaps if everybody on the

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
team picked them up because maybe

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,259
everybody on your team is capable of

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,160
picking up the accountabilities of the

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,480
scrum Master the the team would have a

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,239
hard time getting anything done if

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,000
everybody's picking that up so that's

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,280
that's one person who the team respects

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
says well I'll pick up some of these

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,780
things and go sort them out so that so

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,000
that you can all focus on delivering

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,319
valuable product and being as effective

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,760
as you can at delivering valuable

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,220
product and here's some things that I'm

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,300
going to pick up and help up with and

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,220
help enable you as a team to do

65
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,200
um the the

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,319
something so that we can all get on with

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,780
the stuff that we need to do right and I

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,760
think that's that's that idea that

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,680
scrum.org is trying to sell of the

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,959
professional scrum master of

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,660
professional scrum is that

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,319
um we're doing the thing

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,120
rather than going well you know we you

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,000
know we we I'm going to be the scrum

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Master but in actual fact it's Sprint

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,239
planning I'm gonna you know tell the

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,159
team right you're not taking on it

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,080
you've not taken on enough work this

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,959
Mark this Sprint I'm sure you can fit

80
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,060
some more work in there oh Bob have you

81
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,580
you don't have enough stuff assigned to

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,379
you I think some more stuff uh you can

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,019
take on some more stuff this print right

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,400
and and and that idea of well that

85
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,800
that's not

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,620
scrum Master right that's that's that's

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,720
uh that's uh well I guess I might say

88
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,099
that's a project manager but even if if

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,480
you were a project manager and you were

90
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,099
doing that you kind of suck at project

91
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,739
management too

92
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,260
so so that's just somebody who sucks

93
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,360
that's not a professional

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,040
if when you're a professional you you

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,900
you figure out what what are the things

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
I can do to help my team be more

97
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,319
effective right help the group of people

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,420
that I'm working with or that I'm

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,940
managing right it doesn't matter what

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,400
terminology you use how do you help that

101
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,799
group be more effective stop doing

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,019
things that that are less effective or

103
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,519
try and change things in your

104
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,959
organization are less effective and

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,720
increase their effectiveness that's

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
really all we're talking about from from

107
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,599
a professional scrum Master perspective

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,019
is

109
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,760
do the thing don't just

110
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,540
mess about the edges of the thing

111
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,540
actually do it
