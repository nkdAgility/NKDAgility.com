Having everyone from your company attend a workshop together opens up opportunities for candid conversations you wouldn't typically have in a public class with competitors. 💼</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In a private workshop, you can delve into your 'dirty laundry' without external eyes peering in. It is an arena for mutual learning, real-time problem-solving, and unique experience sharing.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the significant advantages of the APS class is that it's an experiential class, a practical 'how do we engage in problem-solving. This practical, hands-on problem-solving approach is at the core of Agile principles and Scrum methodology.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-power-of-scrum-workshops\">Power of Scrum Workshops</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>What are the benefits? Simply put, they are plentiful!</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Here are some benefits of why organisations should consider running an Applying Professional Scrum Workshop. 🚀</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>✅ <strong>Collective Learning and Conversation</strong>: You can maybe have conversations you wouldn't want to have in front of, let's say you're in a class in one of your competitors is also in a public class.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>✅ <strong>Experiential Learning:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a practical 'how do we engage in problem-solving. So the first part of people's experience as a group is that they understand how they currently approach problem-solving.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>✅ <strong>Embracing Scrum:</strong> Then we teach them Scrum. We run a bunch of exercises, have a bunch of conversations, and then do another Sprint where they use Scrum practices.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>✅ <strong>Holistic Participation</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; it's important to bring everybody to the class so they all understand what value Scrum is bringing.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>✅ <strong>Safe Environment to Experiment</strong>:&nbsp; During the class, you've got a safe environment to do things differently from how your organisation is. It gives them a chance to put their organisational baggage down and do things a different way.\"</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-level-up-your-organisation\">Level Up Your Organisation</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Running an Applying Professional Scrum Workshop can be a transformational step for your organisation.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If done well, it can result in a more Agile, responsive, and efficient workforce ready to tackle future challenges head-on! 🌟</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Here's a list of a few advantages:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>First and foremost, it exposes your team to practical problem-solving exercises, shedding light on how they currently approach tasks and challenges.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Secondly, it was an eye-opening experience. Through practical exercises, teams are 'thrown in the deep end', revealing their default process when asked to build something. It's a reality check and often a much-needed one!</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Lastly, teams are shaken out of their comfort zones through hands-on exercises and intense feedback sessions.
