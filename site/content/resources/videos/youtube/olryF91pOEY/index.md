# Can organizations run an Applying Professional Scrum workshop? How will that help them?

Sometimes, in our enthusiasm to successfully adopt #scrum, we can focus on the dogma of #agile and the mechanics of #scrum a little too much. 

That focus on the mechanics, rather than the spirit of the #agile values and principles as described in the #agilemanifesto can lead to teething problems, which in turn become bigger problems as they become embedded in our daily practice.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of running an APS (Applying Professional Scrum) workshop for your team to get them focused on working effectively and applying the #scrumframework properly.
