1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,580
all right so the questions can

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,260
organizations run a professional uh

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,300
scrum applying professional scrum

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,639
workshop and how will it help them

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,060
um I think of that they can

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,400
um we teach probably more private

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,340
applying professional scrum EPS classes

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
uh than public ones

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,760
um

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,199
it can be of huge value to have

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,119
everybody

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,800
within the bounds of the class be from

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,540
the same company right because you can

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,340
maybe have conversations that you

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,840
wouldn't want to have in front of let's

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,579
say you're in a class in one of your

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,520
competitors is also in a public class

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,020
right you I want to air some of the

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,739
dirty laundry that you might want to

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,539
hear during that private class and but

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,899
one of one of the big advantages of the

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,800
aps class is that it's an experiential

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,699
class it's a it's a practical how how do

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,260
we how do we engage in problem solving

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,780
um so the first part of the experience

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,420
that that people have as a groups right

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,420
so if you bring your whole team to the

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,799
class is that they they they get an

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,080
understanding of how they currently

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,380
approach problem solving

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,520
right so that this this works for both

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,659
teams that are doing scrum perhaps and

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,580
I've been doing it for a long time and

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,439
kind of want a tune-up

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,479
um as well as teams that are not doing

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,640
we're not doing anything particular and

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,680
we want to change to doing a new process

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,700
and maybe there's some some capability

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,860
in in scrum that we want to Leverage

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,900
um and so the first exercise that we

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,600
have them do is a practical exercise

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,700
Building Product

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,540
um and it's generally a bit of a car

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,600
crash right so they learn how their

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,920
current approach and the outcome they

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,240
get from their current approach

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,100
we kind of throw people in the deep end

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,500
and we just ask them to build some stuff

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,840
right but that's their default process

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,000
when you and your company go ask them to

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
build some stuff this is how they

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,860
initially approach solving the problem

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,840
and then we go through the process of

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,120
it's usually quite dramatic by the way

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,560
that that experience especially me

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,500
providing feedback on the product

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,360
they've created especially if they uh

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,640
deliver a PowerPoint presentation

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,500
instead of an actual product right which

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,599
has happened on occasion

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,239
um but I can be quite quite

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,700
um negative about the work that they've

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
done right which is very traumatic for

64
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,599
the people that are hearing it so they

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,480
get this kind of shock of

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,340
oh maybe maybe we've got a problem maybe

67
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,260
we're not understanding how we're

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,819
supposed to get to working usable

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,220
product at the end of every iteration

70
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,680
maybe maybe we need to think about this

71
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,200
differently right they've just failed so

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,000
their minds are more open to change

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,060
right what could we do differently in

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,700
order to have a more happier outcome and

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,260
then we teach them scrum we're on a

76
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,580
bunch of exercises we have a bunch of

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,360
conversations

78
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,420
and then we do another Sprint where the

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,400
use scrum practices they have a scrum

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,720
Master they have a product owner and

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,599
that

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,200
difference in how they feel right

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,560
connected to the way they work currently

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,819
changes their perception on what it is

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
they're trying to do how are we trying

86
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,659
to solve this problem how can these

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,900
tools that that we're talking about

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,640
scrum how can this tool help us get

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,739
better at delivering usable working

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
products and there's more to it than

91
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,040
that right there's a there's a much more

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,280
to it than that but that's one of the

93
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,319
key key learning outcomes of of the

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,860
class is that practical engagement with

95
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:50,159
the people that are actually there and

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,319
it really helps when you've got a

97
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,780
cross-functional group of people

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
so I actually don't recommend just

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,340
bringing your your software Engineers

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,780
right or just bringing your testers to a

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,739
class although I've had people try and

102
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,560
do that

103
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,120
and but you want to bring a whole who

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,280
who are the people that are building

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,280
this product right so maybe you've got a

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,560
team of of of of five to ten people who

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,299
are working on your product

108
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,440
who are the other people that engage

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,160
with them

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,740
right so that might be stakeholders that

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,300
might be other people from other teams

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,940
it might be people in leadership

113
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,740
positions that engage with this team

114
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,160
bring everybody

115
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,820
to the class so they all get a clear

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,220
understanding of what value scrum is

117
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,199
bringing right because you want the

118
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,620
people in a leadership position

119
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,259
to help enable this thing

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,360
you want the stakeholders to help enable

121
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,060
this thing and get engaged in the

122
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,440
process and provide help and support to

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,720
doing things differently

124
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,360
if everybody that surrounds your team

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,580
your your your group of people that you

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,520
want to do things differently aren't

127
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,320
inherently understanding and engaged in

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,280
that process

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,400
they may not understand why you're doing

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,500
things a particular way and then they

131
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,419
feel like it's not going to provide them

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,660
with value so why would they support it

133
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,160
and in fact maybe they sabotage it not

134
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,259
consciously right but you're not

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,940
providing what I just want this thing

136
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,360
and that might not be the engagement

137
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,120
that that's required so

138
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,139
that how can it help right quite part of

139
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,419
that question

140
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,680
is is is

141
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:41,160
it gives everybody that may be involved

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,060
in this process a clear understanding of

143
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,919
what value it's intended to bring

144
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,780
and it gives them a clear understanding

145
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,300
because during the class you know you've

146
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,919
kind of got a safe environment to

147
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,780
um do things differently from the way

148
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,919
your organization is it gives them a

149
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,720
chance to put their baggage

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,460
organizational baggage down and do

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,560
things a different way

152
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,860
and they also get a clear understanding

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,680
of well maybe we like this different way

154
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,820
right we everybody within the bounds of

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,320
the class sees that they like this

156
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,539
different way but they realize that

157
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,539
there are organizational things

158
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,919
that are going to make it difficult to

159
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,080
do that differently

160
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,780
and if you have the support of your

161
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,759
stakeholders leadership

162
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,280
and all the people that are building the

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,199
product it's very easy to make changes

164
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,780
to the way your organization does things

165
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,039
right because everybody's supporting it

166
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:38,400
uh uh uh from that perspective so

167
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,740
um I think that that

168
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,259
shared vision

169
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,080
of what it looks like going forward into

170
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,300
the organization is for me the the

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,620
clearest value proposition of the EPS

172
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,380
Workshop

173
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,180
right is that that everybody's then on

174
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,979
the same page everybody understands what

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,020
we're trying to do everybody's

176
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,080
potentially supportive right that's part

177
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,979
of my job as the trainer is to to to to

178
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,620
to to not only teach people scrum but

179
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,259
help deal with those I don't know what

180
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,080
do you call them when um

181
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:16,800
there might be negative perceptions of

182
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,020
of scrum or agile or or whatevers that

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,240
come from how people have seen it work

184
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,759
at other organizations or how it's been

185
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,979
used trying to dispel a lot of those

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,020
myths poke at some of those things and

187
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:31,080
and help everybody understand what they

188
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,639
could get from it if they did it in a
