    "title": "Continuous Delivery Without Compromise: Why Best Practices Donâ€™t Exist in Complex Systems",
    "description": "In this video, I dive into a question I often get: *What are the best practices for enabling continuous delivery?* The answer may surprise youâ€”there are no best practices in complex environments. Instead, there are *adequate practices* that must adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of your team, product, and market. Watch as I explore the philosophies and techniques that can support your organization in delivering quality software continuously while maintaining user trust and system reliability.\n\n ðŸ“š *Chapters*  \n1. *00:00 Introduction* â€“ Why best practices donâ€™t exist in complex environments.  \n2. *02:15 Adequate Practices, Not Best Practices* â€“ Adapting to your unique context.  \n3. *05:00 Audience-Based Delivery vs. Environment-Based Delivery* â€“ Moving away from traditional Dev-Test-Staging-Production models.  \n4. *08:45 Testing in Production* â€“ Embracing the reality of modern systems.  \n5. *11:30 Real-World Example: Azure DevOps Team* â€“ How audience-based delivery transformed deployment.  \n6. *16:00 The Role of Telemetry in Continuous Delivery* â€“ Monitoring, feedback, and decision-making.  \n7. *19:30 Circuit Breaker Pattern and System Resilience* â€“ Ensuring users can work even when parts of the system fail.  \n8. *25:00 Fix It, Find It, and Fix It Again* â€“ A philosophy for evolving automated checks.  \n9. *29:00 Final Thoughts* â€“ Continuous improvement as a relentless pursuit.  \n\n\n ðŸŽ¯ *Who This Video is For*  \n- *Engineering Teams & Leaders*: Seeking ways to support frequent, high-quality deployments.  \n- *Delivery Managers & Product Owners*: Balancing user experience with delivery speed.  \n- *CTOs & System Architects*: Adopting adaptive philosophies in system design.  \n- *Software Teams Moving to Continuous Delivery*: Transitioning to modern deployment strategies.  \n\n ðŸŒŸ *What Youâ€™ll Learn*  \n- Why best practices donâ€™t apply to complex systems and what to use instead.  \n- How audience-based delivery models enable better testing in production.  \n- The importance of telemetry and feedback loops in continuous delivery.  \n- How the Azure DevOps team leveraged audience-based delivery and automation to evolve their systems.  \n- Why resilience patterns like the circuit breaker are critical for maintaining user trust during system failures.  \n\n ðŸ’¡ *Key Takeaways*  \n- *No Best Practices*: Instead, focus on adaptable, adequate practices suited to your unique context.  \n- *Audience-Based Delivery Works*: Deploy small changes to select users and expand iteratively.  \n- *Testing in Production is Necessary*: Thereâ€™s no substitute for real-world validation in complex systems.  \n- *Resilience is Key*: Implement strategies like the circuit breaker pattern to ensure continued usability.  \n- **Relentless Improvement**: Continuously update your practices and systems to support quality and stability.  \n\n ðŸ”— *Ready to Enable Continuous Delivery for Your Team?*  \nAt **Naked Agility**, we help organizations embrace modern practices, adopt adaptive philosophies, and deliver quality software with confidence.
