1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,319
I often get asked about best practices

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,599
that help teams do continuous delivery

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,400
how do how one of the best practices and

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm I'm going to start right up front by

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
saying there's no such thing as best

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,359
practices when you work in the complex

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,840
environment there's no such thing as

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,720
best practices best practices are for

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,720
simple work in simple environments where

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,240
you can have a procedure and you follow

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
it continuously it becomes the best

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,960
practice the best way to do it and you

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,680
get the same results every time that's

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,360
not the world that we live in so the the

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,200
phrase I quite often use which is I

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,520
guess a little bit passive

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,160
aggressive there's there's no best

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,680
practices there are only adequate

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,840
practices for the situation at hand and

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,000
the situation might change right that's

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,239
that's fundamentally what we're talking

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,920
about but there are a bunch of

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,440
practices that we see many organizations

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,640
leveraging and getting success

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,840
from and we should try them and see if

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,360
they work for us that maybe that may be

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,880
makes more sense than than than best

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,119
practices so the question usually is and

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,280
if I take out the word best there what

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,280
practices enable cross functional

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,159
collaboration to support continuous

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,320
delivery without compromising quality

33
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,640
one one of those practices is some way

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,320
to control

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
what code ends up in production or not

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,200
that's a that's a very powerful practice

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,960
or what code is enabled for people

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,560
that's probably a better way to just say

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,320
it most most organizations most

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,280
products are have moved or are moving

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,840
towards or are thinking of moving

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,439
towards more of an audience-based

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,920
deployment pattern or delivery pattern

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,159
rather than an environment-based

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,640
delivery pattern right and so there is

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,799
still environments within the context of

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
this depending on how it's set up but

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,360
one of the the I think one of the core

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,680
practices that supports this idea of

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,040
continuous delivery that supports this

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,519
idea of continuous quality in in in

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,480
production is is definitely moving

53
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,720
towards audience-based delivery strategy

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:31,080
so in the old the old in the ye olden

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:33,720
days the delivery strategy was Dev test

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,920
staging production right Dev test

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,040
staging production kind of thing and

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,599
everything was done in Dev the

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,519
developers built all the stuff and then

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,159
it got pushed

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,280
to test testers tested all the stuff and

62
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,319
then it get pushed to staging and

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,599
something else usually load testing

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,599
there and then it got pushed to

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,519
production maybe if you're deploying to

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,760
customers they have in the way right

67
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,000
there also a uat enironment um these are

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,840
all costs these are all at costs and

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,239
they're extreme costs and they're not

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,680
worth it costs they they they not only

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,560
have a cost to actually do at the time

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
they have massive massive cost

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,239
implications on our ability to build the

74
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,319
right thing they have massive cost

75
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,720
implications on um the cost of fixing

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,239
stuff later and they have massive cost

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,239
implications because we're we're

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
effectively testing quality in rather

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,640
than building it in right testing

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,959
quality in is the most expensive way to

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,200
gain gain quality building quality in is

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,599
is how how we should be doing that so

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,799
this this practice of audience-based

84
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:47,920
right audience-based delivery means we

85
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,040
switch to a model and I'm I'm going to

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,920
use the words I'm going to use make it

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
sound like we're testing in production

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,040
and in

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,360
fact that's one of the the terminologies

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,200
that that we do use in that context is

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,200
testing and production right and the

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,840
reality of the world in which we live in

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,439
Building these complex interconnected

94
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,879
systems that we all build and work on is

95
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,199
that there is no place like

96
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,239
production there's there's no way to

97
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,120
simulate production there's no way to

98
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,040
truly validate that What You've Done

99
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,280
Works in production until you get to

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,639
production so wouldn't it be better is

101
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,240
if we can get a small change quickly

102
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:39,400
into production for a small set of

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,840
users and then be able to

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,199
increase or decrease that user set on

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
demand so that we can validate that the

106
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,199
product works in real world and real

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,440
real scenarios and that's effectively

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,400
what what what we talk about with this

109
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,240
set of practices this idea of of

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,840
Shifting left and

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,120
continuous continuous delivery and

112
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,360
there's a lot of practices that help

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,800
with that so so audience-based

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,919
deployment model is probably um the the

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
the the main thing and if you're

116
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,919
thinking oh our product is too big and

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,440
too complicated to be able to do that

118
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,759
the windows team move to that Windows is

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,319
deployed on an audience-based

120
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,840
model rather than more traditional

121
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,720
environment based model there's because

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,120
there's is a physical product that's

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
physically deployed to people there's

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,400
still a little bit of the old school

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,199
environment in there for sure so it's

126
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,600
not a complete

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:49,880
thing Cloud products you can go complete

128
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:53,680
but they go their their time from uh

129
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,840
cutting code to it being in production

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,240
with real users is only I I I think for

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,680
themselves it's only a few hours like

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,759
internal to the windows team but nightly

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
as I understand at least nightly they're

134
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,319
deploying new versions of Windows out to

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,039
all of the participants within Microsoft

136
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,199
so if you're inside of Microsoft and you

137
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,840
take a a BG it that's their internal it

138
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,280
Department BG build of Windows like

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,479
you're not self-managing BG build then

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,919
um you you're you're getting nightly

141
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,080
builds of Windows or or I think many

142
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,880
people are that means that what the

143
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,520
Developers wrote yesterday you're

144
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,919
testing today and it's in production

145
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,240
because you're you know you're a manager

146
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,919
in Microsoft um you're doing your day

147
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,160
job which is managing people you might

148
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,840
be a mar managing marketing people right

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,400
inside of Microsoft uh or managing

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Consultants or managing whatever and

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,599
your machine has the latest version of

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,240
Windows you're you're using it in

153
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,560
production so that's getting into

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,599
production as quickly as possible and

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,080
then what they're doing the engineering

156
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,280
team is they're monitoring the Telemetry

157
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,319
this is the audience-based deployment

158
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
model they're monitoring the Telemetry

159
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,960
and deciding what whether they want to

160
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,400
open that particular build out to more

161
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,319
people um and when they open it out to

162
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,080
more people the next ring they I guess

163
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,440
Microsoft called them Rings ring based

164
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,360
deployment model right but it's really

165
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,639
audience-based each ring has an audience

166
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,280
of people and they're they're all

167
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
production and they're just opening it

168
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,240
out to more and more people that's

169
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,919
that's a pretty simple version because

170
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,919
it is a physical product that's deployed

171
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,879
on your machine right physical which

172
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,919
your operating system so so it's it's

173
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:42,560
got to run on bare metal and in Cloud

174
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,800
but it runs on metal right but if if you

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,639
look at something like Microsoft teams

176
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,440
Office 365 right they they have the

177
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,840
ability to switch on and off features

178
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,560
for specific users so regardless of what

179
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,360
build is shipped in Microsoft teams for

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,840
example and I have I'm in the tap

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,000
program for teams basically their

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,400
version of the Insiders and I get

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,520
features before the general public the

184
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,080
the the everybody gets features and that

185
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,479
can be specific to me as an individual

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,840
user within my company or all users

187
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:27,639
within my company and that enables that

188
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,800
choice right so you even as a customer

189
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,839
in the tap program I can choose that I

190
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,159
get the oh my goodness me The Cutting

191
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,080
Edge latest and greatest and somebody

192
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,760
else in my business gets

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,880
the reasonably reasonably stable they're

194
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,399
kicking the tires ready for for moving

195
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,720
to wider audience more general public

196
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,560
audience and then general public have a

197
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,880
way to opt into some extra features and

198
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,399
things so it it we're all able to

199
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,800
communicate with each other right we can

200
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,640
all join the same call and some people

201
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,399
are using more different features from

202
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,079
other people within the context of that

203
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,560
call some of them have new capabilities

204
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,440
whole new code bases that are that are

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,320
running their part of that that story

206
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,839
and it's really interesting because I I

207
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,120
I do I do do calls with Folks at

208
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,079
Microsoft and I've had Folks at

209
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,680
Microsoft who are on much earlier builds

210
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,320
than me because they're choosing to help

211
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,440
out that team or they work on that team

212
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,399
and yeah occasionally their call drops

213
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,720
and they have to log back in like oh

214
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,680
sorry early build I got a bug and

215
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,120
that's there's a risk benefit analysis

216
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,079
there if you're working in a company and

217
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,880
you

218
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:48,480
want to take the earlier features so

219
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,800
that you can pre validate them for your

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
company understand what they are to help

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,160
with training and whatnot of people in

222
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
your company understand what's coming

223
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
down the pipeline then you can choose to

224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,800
do that but you're choosing to take a

225
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
little bit of risk right because it's

226
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,079
going to be a little bit less stable

227
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,720
it's going to be a little bit L this is

228
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,920
this idea of testing in production I'm

229
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,560
not expecting a complete crash of

230
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,640
everything and nothing works right but

231
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,000
the occasional glitch the occasional

232
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,079
weirdness I'm good with that I teach

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,680
training classes on Microsoft teams I

234
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,160
teach all my classes on Microsoft teams

235
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,880
using Microsoft teams breakout rooms

236
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,519
using all those things I'm in the tap

237
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,079
program I have an earlier capability

238
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,279
occasionally things go a little bit

239
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,040
weird for me that's just a teaching

240
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,480
moment in the class cuz we're talking

241
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,959
about how we deliver software and how we

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,839
deliver products and part of that is

243
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,000
accepting that there are going to be um

244
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,839
some mistakes they're going to be if

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,040
you're doing continuous delivery to

246
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,760
production there are going to be things

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,279
that get past your your automated Gates

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,920
Right and and end up in production it's

249
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:57,959
what you do with that information that's

250
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,160
one of the best complimentary practices

251
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm I'm going to use the word best there

252
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
is is that philosophy and how you do in

253
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
fact it's not even a practice it's a

254
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,839
philosophy you need to have a philosophy

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
of fix it find it and fix it so if

256
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,399
something does make it past into

257
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,920
production and you're doing continuous

258
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,200
delivery you need to figure

259
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,600
out how why how did this get past my

260
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
automated

261
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,880
checks and how can I change my automated

262
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,800
checks to be able to catch those things

263
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,399
that's that's that's that's it

264
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,040
if you find oh it's not possible to

265
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,959
change our automated checks because of

266
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,600
the way we've architected the system and

267
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,959
this you might be ask I would expect a

268
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,760
team to be asking themselves the

269
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,880
question should we be changing our

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,720
architecture so that these types of

271
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,240
problems can't make it into production

272
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,920
and how long is that going to take a

273
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,720
great example the aure devops team had a

274
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,880
a bunch of

275
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,320
incidents where one service that really

276
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,600
shouldn't be mandatory took out the

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,560
entire platform right so they're running

278
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,560
a an online platform and for example the

279
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,680
profile service this is the the this was

280
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,160
their first example the profile service

281
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,279
stops working does it matter that you're

282
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,199
showing like the ID of the user or the

283
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,079
good of the user versus

284
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,760
The Friendly name of the user because

285
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,199
the pro you get that friendly name I've

286
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
got the gooded I get the friendly name

287
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,040
name from the profile service and now I

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,360
can display the friendly name but what

289
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,639
if that profile service is down would

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
you rather your entire system was down

291
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,680
or it showed a good in place of a

292
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,920
username in some cases right some small

293
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,519
number of cases I'd rather it showed the

294
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,800
good and the system still worked because

295
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,800
then my users can still do their job my

296
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:57,120
users can still use the system they just

297
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,600
see a a small controlled glitch right

298
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
and then when that profile service comes

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,360
back up or we fix it that turns back on

300
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,160
again and there's a pattern a coding

301
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
pattern called the circuit breaker

302
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,079
pattern and it's exactly what you think

303
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,480
it is when one of the services stops

304
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,120
working it breaks the circuit and then

305
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,760
every so often it tries the circuit to

306
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,440
see if it's back up and if it's not up

307
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,279
it just breaks the circuit again and

308
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,760
then Waits a little bit longer and then

309
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,600
tries the circuit if it still doesn't

310
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,760
work breaks the circuit and waits a

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,000
little bit longer so this service on

312
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,079
this site is not down because it can't

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
connect to this service and the Azure

314
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,199
devops team had this problem that the

315
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,880
profile service took out the entire

316
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,839
system so millions of developers all

317
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,480
over the world were unable to look at

318
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,839
their code do their work items do all

319
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,440
these things because the friendly name

320
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,760
couldn't be displayed i' mean a bit

321
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,880
factious with that but the profile

322
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,800
service was

323
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,440
down that's insane so one of one of the

324
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,120
practices that you need to think about

325
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,320
is one of the let's call it philosophy

326
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,680
the philosophy you have to think think

327
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,240
about is no we need to change it we need

328
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,880
we need to we need to look at the impact

329
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,600
to our users and make decisions based on

330
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,519
our ability to maintain our service

331
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,880
maintain high levels of quality maintain

332
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,519
the ability for people to continue to

333
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,560
work within the context of our product

334
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,240
even when the unavoidable happens which

335
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,360
is systems are going to break systems

336
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,079
are going to be down how do you uh cope

337
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,959
with that that's probably if I was to

338
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,839
say there's a best practice it's not a

339
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:40,279
best practice it's maybe a best

340
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:44,320
philosophy and that's to to continuously

341
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:48,000
seek to better your product better its

342
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,000
ability to support its users and do that

343
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
continuously and relentlessly
