    "reasoning": "The provided content details the use of Minecraft Education Edition as a tool for teaching and engaging participants in Scrum training through the APS course. Nowhere in the content is 'Service Level Expectation' (SLE) mentioned directly, either as a term or concept. The main focus is on logistics, technical requirements, and the rationale for choosing Minecraft over other case studies to simulate complexity in Scrum environments. There is no discussion on SLE definition, calculation, application, or its role in Agile, Scrum, or Kanban practices. Audience alignment gets a slightly higher score since the content targets Scrum practitioners, who might benefit from SLE education, but the piece itself is not intended for that purpose. Signal to noise is low as most of the content is logistical and technical rather than on-topic for SLE. As there are no explicit SLE mentions or in-depth related discussions, all dimension scores are minimal and penalties are not applied since there is no outdated or undermining information. The resulting confidence score (1.7) appropriately reflects that there is virtually no evidence of SLE relevance in this resource.",
