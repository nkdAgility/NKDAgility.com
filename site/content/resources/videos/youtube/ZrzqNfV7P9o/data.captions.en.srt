1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,940
um so the question was why Minecraft

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,940
makes it so awesome

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:20,640
I started teaching the aps with

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,680
Minecraft 10 years ago 12 12 years ago

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,140
um and 12 years ago

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,580
if you got a group of people together in

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,840
a training room

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,619
and ask them the the default

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,800
um

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,540
case study was an animal website

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,520
right so build an animal website we

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,200
break everybody up into teams they would

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,280
they would pick an animal mascot and

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,140
then they would have to create a website

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,840
about that animal and everybody got the

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,539
same set of requirements

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,059
but 12 years ago that was hard right you

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,700
were probably in a in a in a room with

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,960
limited internet access right if the

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,360
students were all turning up in our

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,640
particular office if there was internet

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,620
it wasn't fast

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,719
and they had to actually go build

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,200
something right they actually had to

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,740
crack open Visual Studio or eclipse or

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,479
whatever their favorite tool was and go

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,060
and go bring all of those things

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,580
together to create a website

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,320
and and that's not true anymore it's

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
just it's just that's not what happens

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,220
anymore what happens when you ask people

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,020
to create an ammo website is they go

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,320
create a Wix site and they're done in

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,640
five minutes they go create a a Google

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,740
sites

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,799
um or whatever other platform is out

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,479
there and they're able to solve that

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,759
what used to be an incredibly complex

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,100
problem in a very short space of time

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,380
and then they're just adding new pages

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,470
and the only thing we really have to

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,079
pick on is that

43
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,040
[Music]

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,500
um

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,960
the only thing we have to pick on is the

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,140
the the the teams

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,780
quality right so are there broken links

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,479
are there half finished pages is the

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,240
text too small to read right which which

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,399
is a little bit I don't know it's just a

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,920
little bit [Â __Â ] though it made the class

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,380
go from this awesome experience where

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,540
you had this hugely complex problem that

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,400
you were solving uh because you had to

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,319
do it in 30 minutes right so I'm a

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,940
website's not complex unless I make you

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,459
do it in 30 minutes then it's complex

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,599
right and it just became simple

59
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,860
so Minecraft brings in that complexity

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,500
again

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,940
um it it it it levels the playing field

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,800
and there's actually two massive

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,780
benefits one is that it levels the

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,260
playing field for everybody in the room

65
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,020
understands complexity it simulates that

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,599
that a complex situation that they have

67
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,060
to organize around to solve that complex

68
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,800
problem within the bounds of of

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,360
Minecraft so we're not teaching the

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,220
whole class in Minecraft right it's just

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,640
the the case study the Sprints that

72
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,099
we're doing in Minecraft and when you

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,680
come back from that you can dive into

74
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:02,940
the relationship problems the way people

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,800
approached the problem you can dive into

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,099
um how they communicated with each other

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,140
all kinds of really interesting aspects

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,879
the additional thing is that everybody

79
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,599
can now participate

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,980
so what would tend to happen when the we

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,340
were during the Sprints of the animal

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,159
website uh there would be a few of the

83
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,159
participants would be the actual coders

84
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,200
who were building the website and the

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,620
rest of the people on the on the team

86
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,260
were either just helping them or doing

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,019
their email uh uh or helping them for

88
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,540
five minutes and then doing their email

89
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,099
or collecting some information emailing

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,580
it to the developer right it goes into

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,200
that black hole of the magic and Magic

92
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,780
Black Magic developer over there who's

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,640
going to going to build the thing and

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,159
then they would have nothing to do

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,440
in the Minecraft space every single

96
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,480
person can participate every single

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,879
person can do something it doesn't

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,159
matter what skill level you have when

99
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,140
you come into it with Minecraft in 30

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,780
minutes you can figure out how to

101
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,720
provide some value figure out how to add

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,920
it you're learning as well so we can

103
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,060
diagnose some of those learning

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,840
techniques it's just fantastic

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,840
experience for everybody
