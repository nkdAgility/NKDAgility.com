1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,879
there are three core principles of caman

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,519
to keep it really simple there's

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,639
defining and visualizing your workflow

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,799
that's like creating your rule book as a

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,760
team how are you going to function what

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,400
does your system look like right so

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,160
defining and visualizing a workflow the

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,840
second core principle is to actively

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,840
manage the items in the workflow so now

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
that you can see them you can see what's

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,239
going on you have a visualization you're

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,280
going to actively take action so you're

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,960
not just going to passively look at it

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,719
actively take action and then the third

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,079
principle is improving your workflow you

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,160
want to make changes to the workflow in

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,079
order to make things a little bit better

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
to make things flow better through your

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
system
