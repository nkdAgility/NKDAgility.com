There are three core principles of Caman. To keep it really simple, there's defining and visualising your workflow. That's like creating your rule book as a team. How are you going to function? What does your system look like? Right, so defining and visualising a workflow.

The second core principle is to actively manage the items in the workflow. So now that you can see them, you can see what's going on. You have a visualisation; you're going to actively take action. So you're not just going to passively look at it; actively take action.

And then the third principle is improving your workflow. You want to make changes to the workflow in order to make things a little bit better, to make things flow better through your system.
