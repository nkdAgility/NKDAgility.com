    "reasoning": "The content focuses on dispelling myths about 'special Sprints' in Agile and strongly advocates for core Agile principles: continuous improvement, accountability, and delivering value at the end of each Sprint. However, the text never directly mentions Objective Key Results (OKRs), does not discuss their theoretical foundations, implementation advice, or any of John Doerr's concepts. While there are general thematic overlaps—like focus, accountability, and outcome-orientation—these ideas are entirely framed within Agile and Scrum delivery context. There are no references to OKRs as a framework, nor do any of the 'four superpowers' get explicitly or structurally mentioned. Even the mention of value is not connected to outcomes in OKR terms. Thus, while the content could arguably be of interest to audiences that might care about OKRs, as it stands, there is neither conceptual depth nor surface mention to warrant classification as Objective Key Results content.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses Agile delivery principles and cautions against 'special Sprints' but does not mention or explore the theory, practice, or terminology of Objective Key Results. Alignment with OKRs is minimal and purely incidental.",

    "reasoning": "The content centers on core Agile values—continuous improvement, accountability, and product increment delivery—aligning with some agency principles (developer autonomy, feedback). However, it never mentions 'Agentic Engineering,' nor does it explicitly discuss maximizing human or AI agency, observability, DevOps integration, or ethical AI. The depth is solid for Agile, but not for agentic topics. The intent is aligned tangentially; audience and focus fit practitioner themes relevant to Agentic Engineering, but most content stops short of philosophical discussions about agency or deliberate engineering design.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article refutes special sprints and promotes Agile values like continuous improvement and accountability, overlapping partially with practices that support agency. However, it lacks any explicit or substantial exploration of Agentic Engineering concepts or themes.",

It does not mention or align with Agentic Software Delivery concepts such as autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic—human collaboration. The intent is to clarify Agile misconceptions rather than explore agentic delivery. There is some audience overlap due to targeting Agile practitioners, but the themes, terminology, and solutions do not reference agentic strategies, governance, or AI integration. No penalties applied as it's not outdated or contradicting the category in tone.",
