1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,680
there are no special Sprints there are

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,360
no Sprint zeros there are no hardening

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,920
Sprints there are no bug fix Sprints all

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:16,680
of these things create safety nets and

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:20,119
safety nets generally get used people

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,080
take more risks because they know they

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,880
have a safety net and risks when we're

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,320
trying to create usable working product

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,640
are not a good thing they are risks to

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,239
the business and we want to focus on

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,719
usable working product at the end of the

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:41,920
Sprint so don't have any special Sprints

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,920
don't be an agile Bandit
