1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,580
do you think that we are in the slope

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,619
of Enlightenment in Garner's hype cycle

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,859
and I would maybe have to say

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:22,080
not yet I think that's going to be my my

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,800
answer I think we're still in the trough

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,160
of disillusionment right and I think the

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,660
reason the reason I think that is

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,360
perhaps I'm wrong right but every time I

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,460
uh uh turn on my my LinkedIn I'm reading

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,540
the feeds I'm I'm seeing what's going on

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,579
every time I look it's uh uh scrum sucks

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,300
scrum doesn't work safe sucks safe

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,239
doesn't work uh agile 2.0 is the way

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,760
forward agile 1.0 is dead

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,960
um agile is dead right there's all all

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,399
these types of posts there's still a

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,399
significant

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,920
and I think majority of people are still

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,860
in that trough of disillusionment does

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,200
that mean that lots of companies are not

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,119
already in the slope of Enlightenment I

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,100
I think they are I think lots and lots

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,760
of organizations out there lots of

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,159
people uh um um are in in that slope of

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,080
Enlightenment already

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,180
um but there are lots of organizations

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,860
out there who just just haven't made it

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,939
yet there's people out there who are

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,560
still

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,299
um disillusioned that they can't have

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,820
twice the features in half the time

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,159
Jeff's book title didn't help with that

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,079
right because it sets a level of

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,119
expectation lots of people don't even

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,740
read the book which is there's a little

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,960
bit of bit going on that's not really

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,840
what it's about right but

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,299
um that that that that that

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,340
belief of what agile was supposed to

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,299
deliver

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,520
um

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,159
most organizations have not really

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,380
worked out the hard work that is

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,420
involved in actually doing it and

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,880
getting there and it's not a magic wand

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,320
that's going to going to going to solve

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,360
their problems so I think I think

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,060
there's still a huge number of people in

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,380
that uh trough of disillusionment I love

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,959
that phrase

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,480
um but as as I think I think we're

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,400
definitely on that upward turn of that

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,640
slope and there's definitely more

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,319
certainly the early adopters and even ow

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,300
could I say the late major some of the

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,060
late majority the early majority sorry

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,980
some of the early majority are already

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,780
um in in that Enlightenment mode that

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,060
they realize that

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,040
um it's not all the hype that is the

61
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,260
important but it's the fundamental

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,660
change in the way we work and the way we

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,760
understand how we do things and that

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,160
realization that it's people that solve

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,900
problems not tools right

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,940
um it's people that solve problems not

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,940
bureaucracy

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,879
um and putting putting truly truly

69
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,099
putting people first and being willing

70
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,540
to dismantle

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,420
um whatever

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,000
processes practices or tools

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,739
ways of doing things are getting in the

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,440
way of people actually doing the work

75
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,000
that they need to do and and helping the

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,400
business

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,440
be successful right

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,220
um I think that's that's that's where we

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,860
are right now but we're we're the we're

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,659
certainly on the little up up of that

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,060
slope I think

82
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,920
