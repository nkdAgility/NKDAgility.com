    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses Agile maturity and the journey through Gartner’s Hype Cycle but makes no explicit or implicit reference to OKRs, their theoretical underpinnings, structure, or purpose. 'Objective Key Results' are not mentioned in any way (neither the term nor its principles), and the discussion is almost entirely focused on Agile disillusionment, people-centric mindsets, and reframing Agile adoption. There is some indirect thematic overlap in the sense that genuine Agile practice may eventually emphasize measurable outcomes and strategic clarity—qualities that the OKR framework can support—but there are no clear links to OKR theory, structure, or implementation. All dimensions score near zero due to the total absence of connection to the OKR framework as defined.",

However, it does not directly reference Agentic Engineering or its key themes such as maximizing agency, systemic observability, DevOps-infused craft, or ethical AI collaboration. While aligned in spirit with enhancing human agency in work, it stops short of discussing the systemic or philosophical design aspects that define Agentic Engineering. The focus is on general Agile maturity and people-centricity, not deliberate engineering of agency for humans or AI. Audience and intent partially overlap, but the discussion remains at a reflective, cultural level rather than engaging engineering practices core to the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The piece focuses on Agile maturity, people-centric work, and overcoming disillusionment, which partially relates to maximizing agency.

The content focuses on the evolution of Agile practice—people, culture, and the hype cycle—without discussing autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agentic architectures, or governance. The alignment is weak; the main idea is overcoming Agile disillusionment, not integrating AI agents with human work. Audience and signal are moderately relevant, as it targets Agile practitioners, but there is minimal conceptual overlap with Agentic Software Delivery. No penalty was warranted as the content is neither outdated nor critical of the category.",
