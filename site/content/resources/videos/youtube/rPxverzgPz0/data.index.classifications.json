There are implicit references to the foundational elements (e.g., transparency, accountability, leadership participation), but these are mostly tied to courses, tools, and practices. The material largely avoids direct examination of the deeper system-level convictions, ethos as a bedrock, or demonstrable system behavior underpinning sustainability and transformation. The primary audience is teams and practitioners, matching the category, but the depth and explicit conceptual alignment to Ethos are moderate, as the content stays practical rather than probing the 'why beneath the why.' Signal is decent, but a notable portion is promotional or general encouragement. No penalties applied.",

The main focus is on team learning, organisational adaptation, and process realignment.

The emphasis is on general team practices, not on the distinct responsibilities, professional accountability, or role delineation of Product Developers per modern frameworks. The audience of new Scrum teams could include Product Developers, but the language never distinguishes this accountability nor delves into the behaviors, integration, or unique challenges of this role.
