In fact, I'd even say that if you're considering whether it's worth the investment for your team, I believe this course hits the sweet spot for beginners in Scrum.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Stepping into the realm of Agile and Scrum can be overwhelming for newcomers. &nbsp;However, the Agile Practitioner Series (APS) course is designed to make this transition seamless for newbie Scrum teams. &nbsp;This course breaks down the complexities of Scrum into digestible modules, ensuring a steady progression from foundational concepts to more advanced methodologies.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-outcomes-are-priceless\">Outcomes are Priceless üåü</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As I've discussed in previous articles, APS's outcomes are exceptional and enlightening.&nbsp; This course gives you a clear understanding of the changes your organisation and team need to make to implement Scrum successfully. üöÄ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;It's not just about learning the ropes of Scrum but also about realising the modifications required in your current operational structures. üîÑ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Organisational Change</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the most impactful exercises in the APS course involves reflecting on what changes your organisation, as a team, needs to make to be successful with Scrum. &nbsp;ü§î</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you're a new team, you have the benefit of a fresh perspective.&nbsp; This course helps you identify gaps in transparency, accountability, and interactions that may be missing in your organisation.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It's all about strategising for success. üéØüëç</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Organisational Change Backlog</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The highlight of the course for many new teams is creating an 'Organizational Change Backlog'. &nbsp;This achievement can be incredibly powerful, especially when leaders are in the room. &nbsp;üí™ And it's usually not difficult for me to tell who the leaders are in that room and nearly always, I'm right.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This backlog represents a collective understanding of what needs to shift in your organisation to make Scrum work effectively. &nbsp;This is a great way to ensure your team feels heard and it promotes active participation from leadership. üó£Ô∏è</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Teams Drive Change</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The beauty of APS is that it doesn't stop at identifying the changes needed within an organisation. &nbsp;The course motivates individuals to volunteer and help implement the items on the backlog.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This is where teams feel empowered, involved, and ready to try something new. &nbsp;They feel they're being heard, which fuels a sense of initiative and drives a proactive change. üëè</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For me, these are the main reasons why the APS course makes the most sense for a newbie team moving into Agility and Scrum.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Course that Realigns</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The APS course is excellent for realignment too.&nbsp; While it's incredibly effective for newbie teams, it also serves as a valuable realignment tool for those who've been in the Scrum game for a while and could do with undertaking regular refresher courses. &nbsp;Without a refresher course, getting lost in the latest jargon, misconceptions, and misguided new practices is easy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>APS helps realign teams to the core principles of Scrum, busting myths like we can't change the sprint backlog after we've started the sprint, which has nothing to do with Scrum whatsoever.&nbsp; The APS course taken as a refresher course ensures teams adapt, evolve and get better at what they do.‚ú®</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The idea is to continually adapt and bring empirical processes into the way we do business.&nbsp; So, I highly recommend the APS course to all newbie Scrum teams to learn Scrum and facilitate a deep understanding of how to create effective change within their organisations.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So why wait? &nbsp;Let's get started on this transformational journey.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you want to learn more about Scrum and Agile methodologies, check out my Agile and Scrum courses that cater to all levels. &nbsp;I promise you'll find immense value! üöÄüí°</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Naked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you are interested in #agiletraining, visit <a href=\"https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/\">https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit <a href=\"https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/agile-consulting-coaching/\">https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/agile-consulting-coaching/</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We would love to work with you.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Keywords: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
