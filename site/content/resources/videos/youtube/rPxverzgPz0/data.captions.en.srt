1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,000
so would I recommend the aps course to a

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,880
newbie scrum team I think that's its

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,660
sweet spot and what it was designed for

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,500
the the the EPS is

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,600
the thing I the the the the outcomes I

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,939
love about the EPS I've talked in other

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,880
videos about like what happens in the

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:35,460
aps but the the outcome is a realization

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,219
of what needs to be different in your

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,540
organization in order to give this thing

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,640
a try

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,500
so if you're a new team in an

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,239
organization moving towards scrum and

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,640
your organization maybe has done a

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,579
little bit of scrum maybe maybe hasn't

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,219
maybe it's brand new to them one of the

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,100
exercises near the end of the class is

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,440
based on everything that you as a team

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,260
you as a group of people attending this

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,559
class have learned

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,900
what are the things that are going that

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,840
you would need to change in your

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,080
organization in order to be successful

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,760
at this because we've just talked about

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,979
um what it should look like the levels

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,920
of transparency the interactions between

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,540
people the accountabilities and perhaps

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,540
those are just not present in your

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,540
organization so what does need to change

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,840
and especially when I have groups of

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,380
people that are new very new to scrum

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,820
there's a a moment at the end where we

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,400
create an organizational change backlog

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,439
um and it it works the best when you

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,119
have leaders in the room

36
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,400
right if you've got a big class and

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,500
you've got leaders in the room I can

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,299
actually say so who's who's the most

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,259
powerful person in the room who's the

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,479
hippo

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,399
right who's the most powerful person and

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,460
and I've done this in classes where it's

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,579
the CEO right and the CEO says uh that I

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,280
am I'm like this backlog's for you right

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,799
and I I literally give it to them and

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,300
it's it it that's one bit that's maybe a

47
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,660
little bit better in person because

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,020
you're ceremonially giving them this

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,980
huge stack I've had 50 cards out of a

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,020
class before here are all of the things

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,000
um that this group of people that have

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,280
just been through this class believe

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,379
need to change in your organization in

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,480
order to be successful at this that's

55
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,900
hugely powerful not only from the

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
perspective of the people feeling that

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,200
they're heard to come up with it but

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,239
also powerful from the CEO participating

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,099
in the class like demonstrating that

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,920
this is important enough that I turn up

61
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,319
and receiving that backlog but then

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,220
actually doing something with it and

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,220
that's where there's been the most

64
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,019
impact from the EPS is when there is

65
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,540
somebody in the room who can take that

66
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,400
backlog who can then do something with

67
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,560
it because you get like who's the most

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,800
important person here's your backlog who

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,739
can help them and people volunteer in

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,379
the room could one person from each team

71
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,760
volunteer to help this person uh action

72
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,379
some of these items and figure it out

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,500
and people volunteer and they feel

74
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,180
involved and they feel empowered and it

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,239
creates this

76
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,580
like I don't know get up and go this

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,280
gumption to go go make the change go do

78
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,620
this thing differently and try something

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,099
new right try something different and

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,000
see if it's successful and I think uh uh

81
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:41,580
that that for me is

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,120
why a newbie team

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,599
moving into scrum moving into agility is

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,099
is almost The Sweet Spot of of the EPS

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,420
class

86
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,580
it's also great to realign

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,319
people who have been doing scrum for a

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,900
while and think they know everything

89
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,220
right uh we need to be doing user

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,319
stories and we need to be doing story

91
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,959
points and we have to do estimation and

92
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,080
scrum says we can't change the Sprint

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,239
backlog uh uh after we've started the

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,159
Sprint and all of these crap things that

95
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,079
are nothing to do with scrum whatsoever

96
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,400
but people believe they are because

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,359
that's how they do things in the

98
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,740
organization and that that realignment

99
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,440
also results in some of the same

100
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,120
epiphanies as well it's not as huge as

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
new teams

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
um but but creating that organizational

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,199
change backlog oh we've got something

104
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,000
wrong let's adapt let's change it let's

105
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,060
bring some of that empirical process

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,820
into the way we do business as well

107
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,220
hugely important
