1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:09,519
what is evidencebased management I think

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,480
the easiest way to describe it is just

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,799
bringing science and empiricism to

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,800
leadership all right how do we how do we

5
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:21,119
make decisions as Leaders what's the

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,359
data that we're using to inform our

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,160
decisions and when we make decisions

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,080
what is the impact that those decisions

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,599
have on the organization and how how are

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,559
we measuring that um in most

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,559
organizations that I see a lot of that

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,000
is done by either gut feeli right so

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:42,079
there's not really any data or it's

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,120
there's a lot of vanity metrics in the

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,199
organization um the the represents us

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,960
looking good but doesn't necessarily

17
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,399
change the way we do business so

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,199
evidence-based management is an attempt

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,079
to address that and help organizations

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,879
understand their business value right

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,760
that's the the the key thing there is

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,880
the business value are we focused on Val

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,200
delivering value to our stakeholders our

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,560
customers and how are we measuring that

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,640
value and it really really talks about

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,960
um uh two two categories with four key

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,360
value areas that you we we we feel like

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,040
um is a good idea to measure right um

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,079
the the at the top we've kind of got

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,799
market value um that's a obviously

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,759
that's key right if we don't have any

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,119
market value we're we're we're not going

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,759
to be a sustainable business um and the

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,560
two sides to that is value we already

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,000
have our current value um so that's in

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360
our product and our services and things

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,439
that our business does right now and the

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,079
other side of that is unrealized value

39
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,880
right what's the value we've got left

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,360
sitting in the table markets we haven't

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,119
uh uh new markets New Opportunities new

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,880
things that we haven't new customers we

43
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,039
haven't got yet um so trying to

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,799
understand those two and although

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:11,760
evidence-based management comes with a

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:15,920
set of um I guess you could call them

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,959
example metrics in each of these in in

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,200
each of the key value areas uh the

49
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,760
reality is that you need to find the

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,640
metrics that make the most sense for

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,519
your organization within those

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,959
contexts I just like to see us having

53
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,560
metrics in each of the key value areas

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,840
so we we were talking about market value

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,640
so current value and unrealized value um

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,040
but there's also our capability as an

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,959
organization our ability to actually do

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,879
stuff right um so the the the the top

59
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,120
two are about doing doing the right

60
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,480
thing are we moving in the right

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,319
direction are we uh focused on filling

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,159
those gaps perhaps in our our Market

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,400
capability um and then the bottom half

64
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,680
is our organizational capability so that

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,840
kind of kind of sits in two key value

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,159
areas so it's four total and that's time

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,920
to Market which is our how fast we can

68
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,319
go from IDE into Market get stuff in

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,360
front of the customers to test our

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,680
assumptions right because we assume that

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,080
something is going to provide value but

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
until we actually get it in front of

73
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,440
customers we're not really sure um we

74
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,640
just you know we have an assumption and

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
and we want to test it um and the other

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,840
side is ability to innovate right right

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,959
how much time do we spend um delivering

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,040
new stuff and what are the things that

79
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,040
impact our ability to spend time

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,439
delivering delivering new stuff and I

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,560
think those four together if we as a

82
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:50,640
business have a core understanding of

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,959
our current value our unrealized value

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,360
our ability to innovate and our time to

85
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,000
Market that gives us a holistic view of

86
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,879
our ability to deliver business value

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,159
and then once we've decided on what

88
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,400
those metrics are and we're we're we're

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,560
able to monitor our organization and

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,599
maybe maybe you only do that quarterly

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,920
right uh collecting a this large set of

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,239
metrics we're then able to see how the

93
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,560
decisions that we make the changes that

94
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,560
we make to our

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,919
organization actually impact on those

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,080
metrics that we've decided to to to look

97
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,400
at so that that is what evidence-based

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,400
management is we're going to use

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,120
evidence to manage our organization

100
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,160
right so this is something that a

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,919
manager would use um at the the

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,360
depending on you know whatever whatever

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,000
you're you're the top of um the pyramid

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,240
for right it could be a product it could

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,960
be a service it could be a whole

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,400
organization a whole company um how are

107
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,280
you measuring these things and how do

108
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,800
you use that data to inform the

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,520
decisions that you make an

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,360
evidence-based manag agement is just

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,639
bringing that story together and saying

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
yes we have metrics yes uh uh we're

113
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,960
we're looking at them we're monitoring

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
them in a regular Cadence and we're

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,720
making different decisions based on

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,000
those metrics and seeing how that shapes

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,080
the direction uh that we end up going um

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,600
and I that's because this is something

119
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,880
that that so many organizations don't do

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,680
you would believe the number of

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,680
organizations that I go into and they

122
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,360
have no goals they have no strategy and

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,360
they have no way to measure it

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,360
um it this this can be a competitive

125
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,960
Advantage right if you able to leverage

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,120
empirical uh uh hypothesis driven

127
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,240
database decisions to shape the

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,000
direction of your organization to the

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
market and the market niches that you

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,280
are able to

131
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,639
find that that can be the competitive

132
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,080
advantage that you need to be successful

133
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,280

134
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,080
