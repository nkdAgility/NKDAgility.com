As many of you know, I’m Martin Hinshelwood, and I’ve dedicated a significant portion of my career to developing tools that facilitate seamless migrations within Azure DevOps. Today, I want to share my insights and experiences with the Azure DevOps Migration Tools, which you can find on the Visual Studio Marketplace. With over 50,000 migration sessions per month and a staggering 340,000 work items migrated in just the last 30 days, it’s clear that these tools are making a substantial impact.

### Getting Started with Azure DevOps Migration Tools

Before diving into the nitty-gritty, I must stress that these tools are not designed for novices. They are built by Azure DevOps consultants who have extensive experience in handling migrations worldwide. If you’re ready to take the plunge, let’s explore how to get started.

#### Key Features of the Migration Tools

- **Comprehensive Migration Support**: The tools support migrations from TFS 2013 and onwards, allowing you to move work items, links, revisions, and attachments across various Azure DevOps environments.
- **Sync Capabilities**: One of the most exciting updates is the ability to sync changes made in the source system during the migration process. This pseudo-sync feature ensures that any modifications are captured and migrated, providing a more accurate reflection of your work items.
- **Customisation Options**: The tools offer various processors to cater to your specific migration needs, including work item migration, area and iteration path migration, and even field mapping for different processes.

### Setting Up Your Migration Environment

When preparing for a migration, I recommend running the tools on a dedicated machine with access to both the source and target environments. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up your environment:

1. **Create a DevTest Lab in Azure**: This allows you to manage your virtual machines efficiently, including automatic shutdowns to save costs.
2. **Select the Right Virtual Machine**: I typically opt for a machine with at least four processors and 16 GB of RAM to ensure smooth operation during the migration.
3. **Install the Migration Tools**: Use Chocolatey, a package manager, to install the Azure DevOps Migration Tools easily. This simplifies the installation process and manages dependencies effectively.

### Configuring the Migration

Once your environment is set up, it’s time to configure the migration. Here’s how to create a migration configuration file:

- **Generate a Template**: Run the migration tool to create a default JSON configuration file. This file will serve as the foundation for your migration settings.
- **Define Source and Target**: Specify the URLs for both the source and target Azure DevOps collections. Ensure that the field names for reflective work item IDs are correctly set.
- **Set Up Processors**: Enable the necessary processors for your migration. For instance, if you’re migrating work items, ensure that the work item migration processor is activated.

### Best Practices for a Successful Migration

From my experience, here are some best practices to keep in mind:

- **Migrate Open Work Items First**: Focus on migrating open work items initially. This allows teams to start working in the new system while you handle the closed items in a subsequent migration.
- **Use Date-Based Queries**: When rerunning migrations, use date-based queries to capture any changes made after the initial migration. This ensures that you don’t miss any critical updates.
- **Monitor Performance**: Be aware that migrating large volumes of work items can strain the Azure DevOps API. Implement automatic retries for any failed requests to ensure a smooth migration process.

### Community Support and Contributions

As an open-source project, the Azure DevOps Migration Tools thrive on community contributions. If you encounter issues or have suggestions for improvements, I encourage you to create an issue on GitHub. Our community is robust, with over 40 contributors ready to assist.

### Conclusion

The Azure DevOps Migration Tools are powerful assets for any organisation looking to streamline their migration processes. With careful planning, a solid understanding of the tools, and adherence to best practices, you can achieve a successful migration that sets your team up for future success. If you have any questions or need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out. Happy migrating!
