00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,040
patching defects at the end is too late

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,639
If you're finding problems during UAT

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
staging or after release you've already

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,320
lost Every latest stage defect costs you

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,520
more time more money and more reputation

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,359
than it should And most of them they

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,240
could have been caught much much earlier

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,720
At Naked Agility we help teams shift

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,359
left We strengthen the definition of

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,680
done to embed quality checks early

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,239
validation during deployment Security

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,120
built into the pipeline Telemetry ready

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,000
before everything goes live When you

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,320
move quality to the front you stop

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,440
firefighting at the back You save time

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,640
You save face And you deliver increments

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,079
you can actually trust Need fewer

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,079
production surprises Let's shift left

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
and catch issues earlier
