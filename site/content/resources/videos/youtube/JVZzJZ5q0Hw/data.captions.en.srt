1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,960
so the question is what what's what's

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,540
the most common mistake or mistakes in

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,340
spin planning and let's start with the

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,740
purpose right

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,180
um Sprints planning's purpose is to plan

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,340
the Sprint

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,619
sounds reductive right but this purpose

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,840
is to plan the Sprint

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,859
um what I would expect to see happen

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,239
there

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,579
is that we we we're going to going to

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,239
um walk into Sprint planning

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,780
with an ordered well understood product

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,180
backlog as input we're probably already

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,340
going to have an idea of what your

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,600
Sprint goal is going to be right because

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,340
you know what your product goal is going

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,219
to be you've probably just discussed it

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,260
at your uh review

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,120
with your stakeholders and what's next

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,300
right

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,340
um and the team probably already has an

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,539
understanding of all the other work that

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,880
they're going to have to bring into the

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,080
Sprint as well as working on the Sprint

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
goal

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,600
so then the purpose of the Sprint is to

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,580
decide what it is we're doing how much

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,080
we think we can do

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,340
um and what what does that what does

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,979
that look like

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,759
so the one of the big mistakes that

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:27,600
teams make is is is not having

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,360
an ordered understood product backlog

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,520
walking into Sprint planning it is the

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,000
fundamental mistake that almost every

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,960
team that I that I work with

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,240
runs into at some point and that's that

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,540
um they're taking on work because

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,840
they're told to take on work not because

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,360
they actually understand that work

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,659
if you're a good good

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,020
um indication of this is if your team is

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,220
sitting doing planning poker during

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,659
Sprint planning you're doing it wrong

46
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,380
you should not

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,539
be sitting doing planning poker like we

48
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,620
don't understand this thing what is it

49
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,360
that's too late that's far too late if

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,700
you're if you walk into Sprint planning

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,099
and you pull something off the product

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,720
backlog and you're looking at it and the

53
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,940
team has never seen it before they've

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,440
got no clue what this thing is and they

55
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,680
suddenly realize that you need a

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,720
firewall change and all ops take six

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,540
weeks to implement a firewall change

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,340
you're just screwed already right you

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,319
can't bring that into this Sprint you

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,099
need to know about that six weeks ago

61
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,900
that's what refinement's for

62
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:45,540
refinement is where you push off the

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
understanding of the work that any any

64
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,680
estimation you want to do although

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,840
estimation's not required by scrum right

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
sizing right or the sizing you're going

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,819
to do the understanding of what's in

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,220
your product backlog all comes before

69
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,980
Sprint planning and when you walk into

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,860
Sprint planning it's a case of planning

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,700
the Sprint not planning all the stuff

72
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,879
that you should have planned already

73
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,300
before you got there right so that's

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,220
that's one of the biggest uh mistakes

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,019
that I see teams making is not already

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,459
understanding stuff I'm going to caveat

77
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:23,640
and say somebody will say uh uh but what

78
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,220
if we just received feedback uh from the

79
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,500
stakeholders at Sprint review and

80
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,840
there's a bunch of unknown stuff that

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,099
comes into Sprint planning awesome we're

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,739
gonna have a long Sprint planning this

83
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,319
Sprint right that's that's where we

84
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,019
might see uh planning poker or other

85
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,239
estimation techniques or whatever you

86
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,840
need in order to gain understanding

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,299
because some surprise happened right

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,060
there was a surprise

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,220
and we need to deal with that surprise

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,900
if every Sprint is a surprise they're

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,519
not doing it right right you're

92
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,560
absolutely not doing it right you need

93
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,900
you need to minimize the chance of

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,000
surprise I there are some products out

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,819
there where they get more surprises than

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
than other products that's cool right

97
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,280
roll with it it's what works best for

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,519
you you're trying to maximize your

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,440
Effectiveness as a team so we maximize

100
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,660
the value that we deliver to the

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,760
customer and for that we need to

102
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,460
understand the work that we're doing we

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,699
need to understand as best we can the

104
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,040
work that is coming towards us

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,380
so that when we get into Sprint planning

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,960
we can have a conversation about what

107
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,580
we're working on this Sprint right

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,320
that's what we're working on this Sprint

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,820
is what comes into Sprint planning and

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,380
ends up in your Sprint backlog and

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,320
that's what you're going to do

112
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,120
but during every Sprint you are also

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,800
working on refinement

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,600
you're also refining things in the

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,300
product backlog you're also gaining more

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,440
understanding of things that you don't

117
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,419
know yet

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,400
so when you're planning your Sprint you

119
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,400
also that's the other thing that teams

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,160
don't take into account you also need to

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,919
carve out how much time do we need to

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,440
spend understanding the surprises and

123
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,560
the unknown in the future

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,479
so that the next Sprint isn't going to

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,460
be on yet another surprise and the

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,740
Sprint after that isn't going to be yet

127
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,259
another surprise okay

128
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,520
that's why

129
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:25,979
doing too much is another thing the the

130
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,199
taking on too much in the Sprint right

131
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,580
because if you take on too much in the

132
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,560
Sprint you're like oh well we don't have

133
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,880
time to do all this refinement

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,860
right

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,419
because we're doing all this stuff and

136
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,979
we've taken on too much and we're really

137
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,139
struggling and we're having to cut

138
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,400
corners and we're really and then we get

139
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,419
to the next Sprint planning and we're

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,919
like oh

141
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,419
we don't understand anything that's in

142
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,740
our product back clock okay we're

143
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,539
screwed again okay we're gonna do the

144
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,060
same thing again and it's uh it's like a

145
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,800
death cycle you also find that teams

146
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,960
that end up in that position often don't

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,460
meet their Sprint goal so now they're

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,720
unhappy that they've not bet their

149
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,360
Sprint goal because that's supposed to

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,120
be a thing right so you've got a team

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,460
that continuously and repeatedly is

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,320
unable to meet the things that they've

153
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,660
been asked to commit to every single

154
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Sprint how happy do you think that team

155
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,039
is going to be

156
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,720
not happy at all right

157
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,360
do happy

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,880
successful teams make great products or

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,100
do sad unhappy teams make great products

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,660
I would suggest that sad unhappy teams

161
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,000
do not make great products so you don't

162
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,300
want sad unhappy teams so stop creating

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,280
them stop building a situation

164
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,319
right here where you have these sad

165
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,199
unhappy teams because they're unable to

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,960
continuously and repeatedly unable to

167
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,759
meet the expectations that they're

168
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,039
setting for themselves but other people

169
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,160
are setting for them as well stop doing

170
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,080
that [Â __Â ] that's really bad right that I

171
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,419
mean that that's that's Sprint planning

172
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,500
is supposed to set that that purpose

173
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,419
that

174
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,220
um set the purpose for the Sprint why

175
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,500
are we doing this Sprint what are we

176
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,900
going to do how are we going to do it

177
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,699
right and you've already failed if you

178
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,259
walk into the Sprint and you don't know

179
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,400
the answer to most of those things

180
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,160
already

181
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,020
right other than surprises right which

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm fully accepting you could walk into

183
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,500
a Sprint and uh great example of that is

184
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Imagine imagine you were working on the

185
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,900
Microsoft teams team

186
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,240
right building Microsoft teams and you

187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,300
walk into your first Sprint planning

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,979
after Lockdown from covid and you're

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,699
told immediately that we've just gone

190
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:35,280
from I don't know uh 150 000

191
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,259
simultaneous users to 500

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,960
000 simultaneous users practically

193
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,599
overnight and that our systems are

194
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,000
starting to crumble right that's where

195
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,979
you throw out everything you thought you

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,099
already knew and you're gonna start

197
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:53,880
again and perhaps they spent 90 of that

198
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,500
Sprint refining what's next and only a

199
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,380
little bit working on the stuff they can

200
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,259
right Sprint planning is all about

201
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,479
figuring out what it is you need to do

202
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,860
next but don't leave it too late get

203
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,860
your refinement in there first

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,460
