1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,940
So the question is,

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,010
what's the most common mistake
or mistakes in sprint planning?

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,050
And Let's start
with the purpose, right?

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,500
Sprint planning's purpose
is to plan the sprint.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,500
Sounds reductive, right?
But its purpose is to plan the sprint.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,780
What I would expect to see happen there
is that We're going to walk

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,940
into sprint planning

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,300
with an ordered, well understood
product backlog as input.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,720
We're probably already gonna have an idea
of what your sprint goal is going to be,

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,640
right? Because
you know what

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,720
your product goal is going to be.
You've probably just discussed it at

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,540
your review

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,080
with your stakeholders
and what's next, right?

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,040
And the team probably already
has an understanding of all the other work

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,280
that they're gonna have to bring
into the sprint as well as working

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,770
on the sprint goal.

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,930
So then the purpose of the sprint is
to decide what it is we're doing,

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,820
how much we think we can do,

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,170
and What does that look like?

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:25,150
So one of the big mistakes
that teams make is not having an ordered,

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,330
understood product backlog walking
into sprint planning.

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,600
It is the fundamental mistake
that almost every team that I work

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,900
with runs into at some point and
that's that they're taking on work

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,720
because they're told to take on work,

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,980
not because they actually
understand that work.

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:57,370
If you're, a good indication of this is if
your team is sitting doing planning poker

27
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,470
during sprint planning,
you're doing it wrong.

28
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,190
You should not be sitting
doing planning poker

29
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,820
like we don't understand
this thing. What is it?

30
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,310
That's too late.

31
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,440
That's far too late.

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,220
If you walk into sprint planning
and you pull something

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,740
off the product backlog
and you're looking at it

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,480
and the team has never seen it before,
they've got no clue what this thing is

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
and they suddenly realize
that you need a firewall change

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
and all ops take six weeks
to implement a firewall change,

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,080
you're just screwed already, right?
You can't bring that into this sprint.

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,740
You need to know about that six weeks ago.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,940
That's what refinement's for.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,300
Refinement is where
you push off the understanding

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,980
of the work, that any
estimation you want to do,

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,760
although estimation is
not required by Scrum, right?

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Sizing, right? All the
sizing you're going to do,

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,480
the understanding of what's in
your product backlog, all comes

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,970
before sprint planning.

46
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,650
And when you walk into sprint planning,
it's a case of planning the sprint,

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,920
not planning all the stuff
that you should have planned already

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,530
before you got there, right?

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,480
So

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,420
that's one of the biggest mistakes
that I see teams making

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,920
is not already understanding stuff.
I'm gonna caveat and say,

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,220
somebody will say,

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,120
but what if we just received feedback

54
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,040
from the stakeholders at sprint review
and there's a bunch of unknown stuff

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,840
that comes into sprint planning?

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,980
Awesome. We're
going to have

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,240
a long sprint planning this sprint, right?

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,720
That's that's where
we might see planning poker

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,610
or other estimation techniques or
Whatever you need

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,150
in order to gain understanding
because some surprise Happened right?

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,280
There was a surprise

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,200
and we need to deal with that surprise.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,160
If every sprint is a surprise
you're not doing it right,

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,440
right? You're
absolutely not doing it right.

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,000
You need to minimize
the chance of surprise.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,460
There are some products
out there where they get more surprises

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,560
than other products.

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
That's cool, right?

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,510
Roll with it. It's what
works best for you.

70
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,210
You're trying to maximize
your effectiveness as a team.

71
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,060
So we maximize the value
that we deliver to the customer.

72
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,900
And for that, we need
to understand the work

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,650
that we're doing.
We need to understand

74
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,820
as best we can the work
that is coming towards us

75
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,440
so that when we get into sprint planning,
we can have a conversation

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,740
about what we're working
on this sprint, right?

77
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,180
That's what we're working
on this sprint is what comes

78
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,720
into sprint planning
and ends up in your sprint backlog and

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,360
that's what you're gonna do.

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,750
But during every sprint,
you are also working on refinement.

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,400
You're also refining things
in the product backlog.

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,270
You're also gaining more understanding
of things that you don't know yet.

83
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,780
So when you're planning
your sprint, you also,

84
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,870
that's the other thing
that teams don't take into account,

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,830
you also need to carve out
how much time do we need to spend

86
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,220
understanding the surprises
and the unknown in the future

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
so that the next sprint isn't going
to be yet another surprise, and the sprint

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,580
after that isn't going
to be yet another surprise,

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,660
Okay?

90
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,460
That's why doing
too much is another thing.

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,290
That taking on too much
in the sprint, right?

92
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,940
Because if you take on too much
in the sprint, you're like, oh,

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,960
well, we don't have time
to do all this refinement,

94
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,610
right?

95
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,760
Because we're doing all this stuff
and we've taken on too much

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,360
and we're really struggling
and we're having to cut corners

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,250
and we're really...

98
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,040
And then we get to the
next sprint planning

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,940
and we're like, oh, we don't
understand anything that's in

100
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,800
our product backlog.
Okay, we're screwed again.

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,520
Okay, we've got to
do the same thing again.

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
And it's like a death cycle.

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
You also find that teams that end up
in that position often don't meet

104
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,190
their sprint goal.

105
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,940
So now they're unhappy
that they've not met their sprint goal

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,240
because that's supposed to
be a thing, right?

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,390
So you've got a team
that continuously and repeatedly

108
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,740
is unable to meet the things
that they've been asked

109
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,900
to commit to every single sprint.

110
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,010
How happy do you think
that team is going to be?

111
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,200
Not happy at all, right?

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,040
Do happy,

113
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,130
successful teams make great
products, or do sad,

114
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,000
unhappy teams make great products?
I would suggest that sad unhappy teams

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,940
do not make great products.
You don't want sad unhappy teams

116
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,220
so stop creating them.
Stop building a situation where

117
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,900
you have these sad unhappy teams
because they're unable to continuously

118
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,500
and repeatedly unable
to meet the expectations

119
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,700
that they're setting for themselves
but other people are setting for them

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,540
as well. Stop
doing that shit,

121
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,470
that's really bad, right?

122
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,400
That, I mean, that's sprint planning
is supposed to set that purpose,

123
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,530
set the purpose for the sprint.
Why are we doing this sprint?

124
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,050
What are we going to do?
How are we going to do it?

125
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,720
And you've already failed
if you walk into the sprint

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,190
and you don't know the answer to most
of those things already,

127
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,700
right? Other
than surprises, right?

128
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,180
Which I'm fully accepting you could walk
into a sprint and a great example

129
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,060
of that is imagine imagine
you were working

130
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,220
on the Microsoft Teams team,

131
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
right? Building
Microsoft Teams,

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,460
and you walk into your first
sprint planning after lockdown

133
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,850
from COVID, and you're told immediately
that we've just gone from,

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,060
I don't know,

135
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,860
150,000 simultaneous users to 500,000
simultaneous users practically overnight,

136
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,010
and that our systems
are starting to crumble,

137
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,780
right?

138
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,850
That's where you throw out everything
you thought you already knew,

139
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,460
and you're gonna start again,
and perhaps they spent 90%

140
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,520
of that sprint refining what's next
and only a little bit working

141
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,020
on the stuff they
can right sprint planning is all

142
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,560
about figuring out what
it is you need to do next,

143
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,040
but don't leave it too late.
Get your refinement in there first.
