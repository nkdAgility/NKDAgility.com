So the question is, what's the most common mistake or mistakes in Sprint planning? Let's start with the purpose, right? 

Um, Sprint planning's purpose is to plan the Sprint. Sounds reductive, right? But this purpose is to plan the Sprint. 

Um, what I would expect to see happen there is that we're going to walk into Sprint planning with an ordered, well-understood product backlog as input. We're probably already going to have an idea of what your Sprint goal is going to be, right? Because you know what your product goal is going to be. You've probably just discussed it at your review with your stakeholders and what's next, right? 

Um, and the team probably already has an understanding of all the other work that they're going to have to bring into the Sprint, as well as working on the Sprint goal. 

So then the purpose of the Sprint is to decide what it is we're doing, how much we think we can do, um, and what does that look like? 

So one of the big mistakes that teams make is not having an ordered, understood product backlog walking into Sprint planning. It is the fundamental mistake that almost every team that I work with runs into at some point. And that's that they're taking on work because they're told to take on work, not because they actually understand that work. 

If you're a good indication of this, it's if your team is sitting doing planning poker during Sprint planning, you're doing it wrong. You should not be sitting doing planning poker like, "We don't understand this thing." What is it? That's too late. That's far too late. If you walk into Sprint planning and you pull something off the product backlog and you're looking at it and the team has never seen it before, they've got no clue what this thing is, and they suddenly realise that you need a firewall change and all ops take six weeks to implement a firewall change, you're just screwed already, right? You can't bring that into this Sprint. You need to know about that six weeks ago. That's what refinement's for. 

Refinement is where you push off the understanding of the work, any estimation you want to do, although estimation's not required by Scrum, right? Sizing, right? Or the sizing you're going to do, the understanding of what's in your product backlog, all comes before Sprint planning. And when you walk into Sprint planning, it's a case of planning the Sprint, not planning all the stuff that you should have planned already before you got there, right? 

So that's one of the biggest mistakes that I see teams making is not already understanding stuff. I'm going to caveat and say somebody will say, "But what if we just received feedback from the stakeholders at Sprint review and there's a bunch of unknown stuff that comes into Sprint planning?" Awesome! We're going to have a long Sprint planning this Sprint, right? That's where we might see planning poker or other estimation techniques or whatever you need in order to gain understanding because some surprise happened, right? 

There was a surprise, and we need to deal with that surprise. If every Sprint is a surprise, they're not doing it right, right? You're absolutely not doing it right. You need to minimise the chance of surprise. There are some products out there where they get more surprises than other products. That's cool, right? Roll with it. It's what works best for you. You're trying to maximise your effectiveness as a team so we maximise the value that we deliver to the customer. And for that, we need to understand the work that we're doing. We need to understand, as best we can, the work that is coming towards us. 

So that when we get into Sprint planning, we can have a conversation about what we're working on this Sprint, right? That's what we're working on this Sprint. What comes into Sprint planning ends up in your Sprint backlog, and that's what you're going to do. 

But during every Sprint, you are also working on refinement. You're also refining things in the product backlog. You're also gaining more understanding of things that you don't know yet. 

So when you're planning your Sprint, you also need to carve out how much time do we need to spend understanding the surprises and the unknown in the future so that the next Sprint isn't going to be on yet another surprise and the Sprint after that isn't going to be yet another surprise. 

Okay, that's why doing too much is another thing. Taking on too much in the Sprint, right? Because if you take on too much in the Sprint, you're like, "Oh, well, we don't have time to do all this refinement," right? 

Because we're doing all this stuff and we've taken on too much and we're really struggling and we're having to cut corners. And then we get to the next Sprint planning and we're like, "Oh, we don't understand anything that's in our product backlog." Okay, we're screwed again. Okay, we're going to do the same thing again, and it's like a death cycle. You also find that teams that end up in that position often don't meet their Sprint goal. So now they're unhappy that they've not met their Sprint goal because that's supposed to be a thing, right? 

So you've got a team that continuously and repeatedly is unable to meet the things that they've been asked to commit to every single Sprint. How happy do you think that team is going to be? Not happy at all, right? 

Do happy, successful teams make great products, or do sad, unhappy teams make great products? I would suggest that sad, unhappy teams do not make great products. So you don't want sad, unhappy teams. So stop creating them. Stop building a situation right here where you have these sad, unhappy teams because they're continuously and repeatedly unable to meet the expectations that they're setting for themselves, but other people are setting for them as well. 

Stop doing that. That's really bad, right? I mean, that's Sprint planning. Sprint planning is supposed to set that purpose. 

Um, set the purpose for the Sprint. Why are we doing this Sprint? What are we going to do? How are we going to do it, right? And you've already failed if you walk into the Sprint and you don't know the answer to most of those things already, right? Other than surprises, right? Which I'm fully accepting you could walk into a Sprint and, uh, a great example of that is imagine you were working on the Microsoft Teams team, right? Building Microsoft Teams, and you walk into your first Sprint planning after lockdown from COVID, and you're told immediately that we've just gone from, I don't know, 150,000 simultaneous users to 500,000 simultaneous users practically overnight and that our systems are starting to crumble, right? 

That's where you throw out everything you thought you already knew and you're going to start again. And perhaps they spent 90% of that Sprint refining what's next and only a little bit working on the stuff they can. 

Right? Sprint planning is all about figuring out what it is you need to do next. But don't leave it too late. Get your refinement in there first.
