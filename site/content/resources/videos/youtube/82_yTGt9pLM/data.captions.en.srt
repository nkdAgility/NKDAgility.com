1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,099
foreign

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,099
Consulting that is a very nebulous term

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,699
that people often have difficulty

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:21,600
articulating what the heck that thing is

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:22,859
uh I have my approach to Agile

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,060
Consulting

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,500
um I have there's a number of different

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,119
parts to it

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,519
um probably the main part again is

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,099
talking to talking to people

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,360
um help people helping people

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,399
um understand that there are other

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,980
options to the way they do things people

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
kind of get a lot quite often people get

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,780
locked into one framework like scrum or

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
kanban

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,920
um and they don't realize that there's

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,559
not there's not really anything making

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,500
them do that one thing there's actually

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,079
lots of choices in that that story what

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,879
are the strategies that you need in

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,879
order to be successful at building

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,260
products at delivering uh whatever it is

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,699
that you're you're delivering as an

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,640
organization

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,540
um and there's often quite a loose

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,460
connection people focus on delivery and

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,979
they forget about the business as well

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,080
right so a lot of agile Consulting is

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,900
helping them understand that this is not

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,840
a tool for delivering stuff agile's just

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,900
an idea that is a different way of

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,119
working for your whole organization

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,560
um and how they can start bringing in

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,360
some of those ideas into their

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,580
organization so it's kind of filling

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,740
that gap between that that Ideal World

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,840
that training talks about

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,220
and the realities of the organization

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,579
and where does the organization

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,680
currently sit on those those those agile

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,540
scales and how do we start moving that

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,840
needle so that they gain more ability

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,880
right they get more uh faster at being

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,979
able to deliver stuff tighter feedback

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,380
loops talking to their customers more

47
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,119
delivering more value and ultimately

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,979
making more Revenue right that's that's

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,380
the ultimate goal of most companies is

50
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,540
to maximize the revenue for the effort

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,579
that they put in so being able to

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,840
increase that so having conversations at

53
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,000
different levels in the organizations

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,920
whether I'm dealing with teams right and

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,660
helping teams get better at building the

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,379
product that they're building

57
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,599
um or talking to people in middle or

58
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,720
leadership

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,760
teams who are orchestrating that across

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,319
a much wider audience either their whole

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
organization or in the Professional

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,220
Services environment

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,560
um so there's a lot of engaging in

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,180
talking with people running workshops

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,160
right helping them not just there's

66
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,560
almost two there's two things that

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,860
workshops are good for right

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,940
um it will run well-run workshops one is

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
that

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,140
um you get the outcome of the workshop

71
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,760
right that's that's one Oak one that's

72
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,319
only one of the outcomes but that's

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,140
that's quite important but the other

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,360
outcome is do the people that came to

75
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,060
the workshop did they learn anything

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,599
that can make their work better right

77
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,700
did they learn how to run workshops

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,459
better how to engage with people better

79
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,340
how to converse with people better and

80
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,980
navigate that Minefield uh that that's

81
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,800
often called the grown Zone

82
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,140
um that that battleground of of people

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,940
not agreeing right which is which is

84
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,459
very common and how do you how do you

85
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,080
navigate that so so building up those

86
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,819
those skills in people that I work with

87
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,180
and that's a lot of agile Consulting is

88
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,040
finding people in your organization who

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,540
are the people that we that need to be

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,940
the ones that are doing the work right

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,440
because I can't do it I'm outside of

92
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,420
your company I can't make changes to

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,099
your company that's not possible it's

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,959
not possible for a consultant to come

95
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,519
and say here here's how you should run

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,980
your business go do it right that's

97
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,599
that's not how it works the people in

98
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,580
your organization need to be the ones

99
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,580
that make the changes that understand

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,519
the ideas and the job of the consultant

101
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,459
is to come in and effectively provoke

102
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,799
change help people think differently so

103
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,799
they see what it is they need to do next

104
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,680
that's that's the hard part right

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,319
um but also you know a state of agile

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,780
reports I've done those as well like

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,939
whereas our organization currently right

108
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,160
lots of organizations are quite large

109
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,139
and perhaps instead of just bringing

110
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,540
somebody in to help them they need to

111
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,699
have a conversation first about what is

112
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,100
the help we think we need where are we

113
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,380
right now and where do we want to get to

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,540
right that's an initial conversation

115
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,580
so I've done reports for organizations

116
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,979
where I come in and I interview people

117
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,500
at all levels in the organization create

118
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,120
a a report that talks about the current

119
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,620
state of agility within your

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,840
organization what are the opportunities

121
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,960
for improvement and what are the top

122
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,419
three things that are are I see at least

123
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,860
I see is the biggest problem

124
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,320
um and then it's up to the organization

125
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,880
to have a conversation about whether

126
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
they need more help or they think they

127
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,120
can do all of that themselves right

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,199
um and quite often they do come back but

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,940
it can take a longer period of time

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,259
right because they go try things they're

131
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,660
trying to build momentum inside the

132
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,979
organization and then a year later they

133
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,960
come back around and say can you come

134
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,340
and help us with additional stuff or

135
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,080
provide some training in a particular

136
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,300
context right

137
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,479
um and and telling those telling telling

138
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,100
those stories inside the organization so

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,500
I think I think that's what I would

140
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,139
quantify as agile Consulting you need

141
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,240
lots of tools in your toolbox

142
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,400
um I try and have as many tools as I can

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,039
I'm always learning and figuring out new

144
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,960
tools and new ways of doing things

145
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,960
um and then bringing that to the

146
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,680
customer engagement knowledge experience

147
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,979
uh uh methods Theory right as well as

148
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,960
tools and capability what is it that

149
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,340
what information is your organization

150
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,160
missing

151
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,199
that I can provide you to help you move

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,539
