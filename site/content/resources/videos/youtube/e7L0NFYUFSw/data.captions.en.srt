1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,820
hmm

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,160
uh does scrum allow you to do twice the

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,660
work in half the time at such a [Â __Â ]

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,299
marketing

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,699
thing isn't it right that that's uh

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,619
that's how I want to sell lots of books

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,740
phrase

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,740
um

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,820
does it do that no

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
right that's not what you're trying to

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,679
trying to achieve when you say twice the

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
features in half the time right you're

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,940
talking about 400 percent

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,660
increase my math is right at 400

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,700
increase in in in in in output and and

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,340
it's and and it's an output focused

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,320
measure right

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,920
features is output and scrum is not

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,460
output focused it's outcome focused

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,280
we want more value not more stuff if we

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,739
could deliver 10 of the stuff that I

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,239
deliver but a hundred times the value

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,340
it's going to be better

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,340
right so

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,799
that that's just some yeah it's terrible

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,960
terrible phrase and probably has done

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,640
quite a lot of damage to to in the

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,040
industry or at least

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,000
um it seems to have have damaged that

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,020
but also Woody actually talks about in

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,420
the book

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,880
right that's the that's the title of the

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,560
book it's like when you see agile books

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,479
that have the word best practice on the

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,159
front and you're like oh but there's no

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,020
such thing as best practice in the agile

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,439
world it's you know emergent practices

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,820
yeah but you your your your publisher is

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,040
not going to sell a book that says

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,360
adequate practices on it right they're

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,939
gonna sell a book that says best

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,299
practices because that's marketing

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:55,140
um so so I when you actually look at the

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,079
contents of the book how he explains

46
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,180
um what he meant by twice the features

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,340
in half the time I think it gets a

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,520
little bit better right it gets a little

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,780
bit better and it is definitely a book I

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
have used

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,480
leverage successfully with people in

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,020
leadership

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,819
to get them more friendly more on board

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,300
with the process especially if they're

55
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,940
very opposed right because it's got that

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,819
cover is covers a good lead right

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,760
they're gonna the opportunity pick up of

58
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,920
that book and so I have I I have

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,540
leveraged it I have bought copies of the

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
book I have a box somewhere with with

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,599
copies and I will go leave them near

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,099
executive bathrooms and customers I go

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,099
uh and then they're gonna that's that

64
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,379
that book that they pick up and just sit

65
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,019
and have a read of and

66
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:51,300
talk you know it talks about the the

67
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,239
Udo Loop it talks about Jeff when he was

68
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,420
a fighter pilot and just those

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,640
compelling stories about where some of

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,040
this where he felt some of this stuff

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,959
came from and being able to do that but

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,280
no the title of the book is just it's

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,379
it's [Â __Â ] you're not getting twice

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,480
the features in half the time you maybe

75
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,580
twice the value and

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,620
half the features I don't know maybe

77
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,680
that makes sense I don't know but it's

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,159
it you want to be focused on outcome not

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,159
output
