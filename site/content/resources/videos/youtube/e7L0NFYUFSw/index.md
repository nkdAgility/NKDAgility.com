# Does scrum really allow you to do twice the work in half the time?

Jeff Sutherland, the co-creator of #scrum, titled his book 'How to do twice the work in half the time' and it's been a value proposition for the #scrumframework ever since.

If you're a traditional organization using #projectmanagement, it can be a very attractive proposition because your focus lies in delivery - execution of a predetermined plan - and it's natural to assume that #scrum will enable your team to simply do more with less.

Many #agile purists and #scrum practitioners will tell you that the goal of #scrum is to be more effective, rather than efficient, and so productivity isn't really the goal of #agile. So, how do we reconcile the value proposition of a co-creator of #scrum with what it actually empowers you to do?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood speaks about the value proposition of #scrum and whether it does actually allow you to do twice the work in half the time.
