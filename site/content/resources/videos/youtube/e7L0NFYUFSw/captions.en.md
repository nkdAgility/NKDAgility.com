Hmm, does Scrum allow you to do twice the work in half the time? That's such a marketing thing, isn't it? Right, that's how I want to sell lots of books. Does it do that? No, right? That's not what you're trying to achieve when you say twice the features in half the time. Right, you're talking about 400 percent increase, my math is right, at 400 percent increase in output, and it's an output-focused measure, right?

Features is output, and Scrum is not output-focused; it's outcome-focused. We want more value, not more stuff. If we could deliver 10 of the stuff that I deliver but a hundred times the value, it's going to be better.

Right, so that's just some... yeah, it's a terrible phrase and probably has done quite a lot of damage to the industry, or at least it seems to have damaged that. But also, Woody actually talks about it in the book. Right, that's the title of the book. It's like when you see Agile books that have the word "best practice" on the front, and you're like, "Oh, but there's no such thing as best practice in the Agile world." It's, you know, emergent practices.

Yeah, but your publisher is not going to sell a book that says "adequate practices" on it, right? They're going to sell a book that says "best practices" because that's marketing.

So, when you actually look at the contents of the book, how he explains what he meant by twice the features in half the time, I think it gets a little bit better, right? It gets a little bit better, and it is definitely a book I have used leverage successfully with people in leadership to get them more friendly, more on board with the process, especially if they're very opposed, right? Because it's got that cover; it covers a good lead, right?

They're going to have the opportunity to pick up that book, and so I have leveraged it. I have bought copies of the book. I have a box somewhere with copies, and I will go leave them near executive bathrooms and customers. I go, "Uh," and then they're going to... that's that book that they pick up and just sit and have a read of.

It talks about the Udo Loop; it talks about Jeff when he was a fighter pilot, and just those compelling stories about where he felt some of this stuff came from and being able to do that. But no, the title of the book is just... it's... you're not getting twice the features in half the time. You maybe get twice the value and half the features. I don't know, maybe that makes sense. I don't know, but you want to be focused on outcome, not output.
