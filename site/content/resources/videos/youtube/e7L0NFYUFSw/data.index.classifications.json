    "reasoning": "The content directly addresses Scrum’s value-vs-output philosophy, debunking a marketing phrase. While it explores outcome focus and briefly mentions collaboration and continuous improvement—concepts relevant to Product Developers—it does not discuss the Product Developer role, structure, or formal accountability. The emphasis is on dispelling myths for a broader Agile/Scrum audience, not specifically for or about Product Developers. Some tangential mention of team behavior merits minor credit, but there is little substantive exploration of Product Developer responsibilities or cross-functional practices. Penalized for lack of focus on the relevant accountability and for a critical (though not satirical) stance, as defined by instructions.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content critiques misleading Scrum marketing but does not address the Product Developer role, accountability, or behaviors as defined in modern frameworks. Its primary focus is on clarifying outcome versus output for a general Agile/Scrum audience, with only minor conceptual overlap.",
