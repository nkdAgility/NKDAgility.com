While it covers topics like autonomy, accountability, feedback, and value delivery—concepts adjacent to Agentic Engineering—it does not explicitly address the deliberate design of engineering practices to maximise human or AI agency. There is little reference to DevOps ethos, ethical AI, or decision decentralisation. The focus is mainly on general Agile dysfunctions, not on agentic engineering frameworks or philosophy. The alignment is thus partial and indirect, focused more on Agile as a mindset or process rather than as a vehicle for maximising agency.",

    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses Agile anti-patterns and guidance for effective Agile practices. However, it does not mention or meaningfully address agentic software delivery, AI agents, contextual intelligence, or human–AI integration. Its focus is on organisational behaviour and culture in Agile, not agentic delivery. There is minimal, if any, implicit relevance—no signal of modern AI, agents, or systemic augmentation. All scores are low in line with the category criteria, as the content lacks conceptual fit or targeted intent.",
