1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,120
so project management was designed to

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,460
plan work that we understand

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,700
or that has low variance at least right

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,119
let's let's call it 10 to 15 maximum

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,380
variance in expected outcome to actual

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,500
outcome

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:28,019
but in in complexity the definition of

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,140
complexity is that more is uh unknown

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,800
than none right so it's at least more

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,020
than 50 percent not understood you don't

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,660
know 50 of what's going to happen those

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,840
are the surprises that creep in as

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,719
you're Building Products uh so project

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,120
management doesn't work in complex

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,579
environments because it doesn't handle

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,579
that level of variance
