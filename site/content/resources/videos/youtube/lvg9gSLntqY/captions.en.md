So project management was designed to plan work that we understand or that has low variance at least right let's let's call it 10 to 15 maximum variance in expected outcome to actual outcome.

But in complexity the definition of complexity is that more is unknown than none right so it's at least more than 50 percent not understood you don't know 50 of what's going to happen those are the surprises that creep in as you're building products.

So project management doesn't work in complex environments because it doesn't handle that level of variance.
