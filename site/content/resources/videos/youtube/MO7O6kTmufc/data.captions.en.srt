1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,280
once you've figured out what your

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,840
outcomes are you need to figure out what

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,920
metrics are going to help you measure

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,000
progress towards those outcomes so I

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,480
mean these can be super tactical things

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
that help you move towards those

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,039
outcomes it can be leading or lagging

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,080
measures there's all kinds of things uh

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,840
that come into that but evidence-based

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,600
management is that application

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,440
of practices within the context of that

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440
data to help you make decisions
