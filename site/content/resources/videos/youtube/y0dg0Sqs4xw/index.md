# What is a common mistake made by rookie agile consultants?

The #agile industry has a bit of a problem when it comes to regulation, skills development, and validation of an #agilecoach or #agileconsultant. In some cases, a #scrummaster with 2 years' experience can simply amend their CV and call themselves an #agilecoach or #agileconsultant without having the necessary skills, expertise, or experience to do the job.

There are great certification paths for an #agilecoach, and there are great #agileconsultants out there, it can just be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff if you've never worked with an experienced #agileconsultant.

So, how do you know if your person is the right person for the job? How do you know if your #agileconsultant is making rookie mistakes or whether they are the perfect catalyst to help you successfully adopt and master #agile?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood highlights a common mistake made by rookie agile consultants and provides some insights into what they should be doing instead.
