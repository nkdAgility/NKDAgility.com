1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,580
I think the common mistake made by my by

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,460
rookie agile Consultants

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,560
is the belief that just following the

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,180
rules of whatever process or or

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,199
practices you've picked is going to

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,199
solve any problems and it's it's not

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,099
uh scrum is a great tool but it is just

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,320
a tool people need to want to do it the

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,540
team needs to want to do it they need to

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,760
pick it not the agile consultant so

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,920
picking

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,860
processes for the team is probably the

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,899
biggest rookie mistake

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,460
um but also focusing on

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,760
the rules

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,620
of the game rather than the under rather

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,360
than the underlying reasons for playing

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,699
in the first place

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,219
right why why are we wanting to move

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,680
towards a greater degree of agility why

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,300
do we want scrum well it's so we can get

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,240
closer to the customers and make better

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,280
business decisions right so that we can

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,900
iterate quicker on the wrong ideas and

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,680
do more of the right thing and less of

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,619
the wrong thing empiricism right

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,040
um so I think their biggest mistake is

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,040
not focusing on those underlying

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,040
principles that support the ideas so

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
that the people involved understand what

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,020
decisions they need to make in order to

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,280
support and benefit from the process

33
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,140
rather than just telling people what to

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
do you're gonna do scrum

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,420
okay well you end up with a lot of

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,000
friction and push back and uh people not

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,000
liking what's going on and if everybody

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,720
in the team's not on boards you're not

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,720
going to be successful
