I think the common mistake made by rookie agile consultants is the belief that just following the rules of whatever process or practices you've picked is going to solve any problems and it's not. 

Scrum is a great tool but it is just a tool. People need to want to do it. The team needs to want to do it; they need to pick it, not the agile consultant. So picking processes for the team is probably the biggest rookie mistake. 

But also focusing on the rules of the game rather than the underlying reasons for playing in the first place. Right, why are we wanting to move towards a greater degree of agility? Why do we want scrum? Well, it's so we can get closer to the customers and make better business decisions. Right, so that we can iterate quicker on the wrong ideas and do more of the right thing and less of the wrong thing. Empiricism, right? 

So I think their biggest mistake is not focusing on those underlying principles that support the ideas so that the people involved understand what decisions they need to make in order to support and benefit from the process rather than just telling people what to do. You're gonna do scrum? 

Okay, well you end up with a lot of friction and push back and people not liking what's going on. And if everybody in the team's not on board, you're not going to be successful.
