# How does Naked Agility select Scrum trainers?

#agile has gained a lot of traction since it's inception in 2001 when a team of 17 brilliant #softwareengineer came together to design a new style of working that departed from the heavily prescribed #projectmanagement processes of the past.

#scrum is one of the most popular and widely adopted #agileframework in the industry, with good reason, but although the #scrumguide is less than 20 pages long, it can be incredibly difficult to implement and master.

It takes a great deal of expertise, experience, and commitment to master #scrum and that's why #nkdagility are so selective when it comes to selecting and partnering with #professionalscrumtrainers from around the world.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood - CEO of NKD Agility and #scrumexpert - explains how #scrumtrainers are selected and why the process is so rigurous.
