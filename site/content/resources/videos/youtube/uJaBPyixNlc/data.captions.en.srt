1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,799
so

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,080
in order to be an associate trainer for

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,039
naked agility ultimately you you you

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,980
need to be able to to co-teach with

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,160
somebody who is already an associate

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,199
trainer or myself who can who can vouch

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,140
for you right

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,059
um but what we tend to be looking for is

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,940
is not

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,520
trainers we're actually our associate

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,579
trainers are not are not just trainers

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,120
our associate trainers are

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:49,260
um consultants and coaches and trainers

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,940
because the reality is the the

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:58,860
thing that makes our training powerful

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,480
is the stories that the trainers have of

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,579
the circumstances that they've run into

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,240
and things that companies have tried and

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,619
why something that that a purist would

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,000
say this is how you should approach

21
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,920
something why that might not work for

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,540
you right here are circumstances where

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,619
it's worked here's circumstances where

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,360
it hasn't right and and how in different

25
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,700
Industries because because you get those

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,840
questions in training you get people

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,080
asking those questions of but in my

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,020
specific circumstance

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
that's not going to work and the trainer

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,280
needs

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,220
the competence and background knowledge

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and expertise to be able to bring that

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,040
person around to understanding why

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,020
that's why that might be an

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,560
organizational dysfunction rather than a

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,299
uh uh you know they can't do it the way

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,520
that they need to do it in order to get

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,259
the benefit they want because of some

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,759
organizational constraint that perhaps

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,180
needs to change

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,399
and and that can be really difficult for

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,460
trainers that are just trainers and have

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,619
never been a a coach or a consultant

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,959
um I myself spent

45
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,000
10 years as a software developer and

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,680
then 10 years as a devops consultant

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
right

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,379
um helping organizations get get better

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,180
at delivering software so I tend to work

50
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,700
with software teams

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,340
um so I just just brought on

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,879
um another another trainer

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,720
um Joanna from scrum.org

54
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:38,040
um she has a PHD in robotics and has

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,260
been coaching uh uh software teams

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,260
um a bit of scrum Master for many years

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,700
before she became a PST a professional

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,060
scrum trainer

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,620
um so that's the type of person that I

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,840
like to work with

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,180
um I work with Russell Miller who's also

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,180
a PST

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,819
but he has developed and built

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,739
components for fighter aircraft in the

65
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,560
US Military

66
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,379
um he designed control surfaces for

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,860
aircraft and project management project

68
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,840
managed uh uh and developed products

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,620
within the the context of Lockheed

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,640
Martin right these are organizations

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:23,280
that are going to test your ability to

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,980
figure out how to do Agile even within

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,620
the most horrendous constraints

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,500
which are the circumstances our students

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,000
find themselves in right so you need to

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,220
be able to have answers for those things

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
you need to be able to have here's a

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,720
place you can start that I have seen

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,540
work oh you're within an organization

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,360
that says you can't do Agile because we

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,000
don't do Agile here here are things you

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,099
can do without using the word agile or

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,900
using the word scrum that will enable

84
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,959
you to get a little bit a little bit

85
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,640
more benefit demonstrate that you can do

86
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,980
something a little bit better make the

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,560
metrics look better right and then

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,659
they're more likely to listen to you

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,760
um it it's it's

90
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,040
yeah I think it's it's it's really

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,159
important that all of the trainers that

92
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,280
we have have the competence expertise

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,139
and experience to be able to

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,199
um

95
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,720
debate with the students on the merits

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,720
of agility within their specific context
