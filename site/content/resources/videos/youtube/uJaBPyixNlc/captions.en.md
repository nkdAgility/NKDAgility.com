So in order to be an associate trainer for naked agility ultimately you you you need to be able to co-teach with somebody who is already an associate trainer or myself who can vouch for you right.

Um but what we tend to be looking for is not trainers we're actually our associate trainers are not are not just trainers. Our associate trainers are consultants and coaches and trainers because the reality is the thing that makes our training powerful is the stories that the trainers have of the circumstances that they've run into and things that companies have tried and why something that a purist would say this is how you should approach something why that might not work for you.

Right here are circumstances where it's worked here's circumstances where it hasn't right and and how in different industries because because you get those questions in training you get people asking those questions of but in my specific circumstance that's not going to work and the trainer needs the competence and background knowledge and expertise to be able to bring that person around to understanding why that might be an organizational dysfunction rather than a you know they can't do it the way that they need to do it in order to get the benefit they want because of some organizational constraint that perhaps needs to change.

And that can be really difficult for trainers that are just trainers and have never been a coach or a consultant. Um I myself spent 10 years as a software developer and then 10 years as a devops consultant right.

Um helping organizations get better at delivering software so I tend to work with software teams. Um so I just just brought on um another trainer um Joanna from scrum.org. Um she has a PhD in robotics and has been coaching uh software teams um a bit of scrum Master for many years before she became a PST a professional scrum trainer.

Um so that's the type of person that I like to work with. Um I work with Russell Miller who's also a PST but he has developed and built components for fighter aircraft in the US Military. Um he designed control surfaces for aircraft and project managed uh and developed products within the context of Lockheed Martin right.

These are organizations that are going to test your ability to figure out how to do Agile even within the most horrendous constraints which are the circumstances our students find themselves in right so you need to be able to have answers for those things you need to be able to have here's a place you can start that I have seen work.

Oh you're within an organization that says you can't do Agile because we don't do Agile here here are things you can do without using the word agile or using the word scrum that will enable you to get a little bit a little bit more benefit demonstrate that you can do something a little bit better make the metrics look better right and then they're more likely to listen to you.

Um it it's it's yeah I think it's it's it's really important that all of the trainers that we have have the competence expertise and experience to be able to debate with the students on the merits of agility within their specific context.
