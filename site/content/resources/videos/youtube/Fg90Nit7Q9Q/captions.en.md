Can Scrum help us align DevOps and software engineering practices? I think it can. One of the fundamental things that Scrum requires is that we have a working, usable product at the end of every Sprint, including the first. That's our fundamental transparency and feedback loop. How do we get that? Do we just get it magically? No, we need engineering excellence. We need DevOps. We need all of those awesome software engineering practices. Bring them together with Scrum, and then we're able to deliver fantastic software.
