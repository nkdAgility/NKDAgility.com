1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,020
can scrum help us align devops and

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,480
software engineering practices I I think

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,240
it can and one of the fundamental things

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
that scrum requires is that we have

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
working usable product at the end of

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
every Sprint including the first right

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,220
that's that's our fundamental

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,619
transparency and feedback loop how do we

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,660
get that do we just get it magically no

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,060
we need engineering Excellence we need

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,340
devops we need all of those awesome

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,539
software engineering practices bring

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,700
them together

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,620
with scrum and then we're able to

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,620
deliver fantastic software
