16
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,480
oh you love it when that when a plan

17
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,480
doesn't come together

18
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,519
there we go

19
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
so

20
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,519
let's do that

21
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
so i'm six minutes late running six

22
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,760
minutes late already how's that for for

23
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,760
timing for folks so let me put another

24
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,240
uh i'm gonna put about five minutes on

25
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
the timer

26
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,440
for us to answer some of these questions

27
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,279
and i can see that the everything is

28
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
working now

29
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
i have a i have a visitor who wants to

30
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,959
say hello

31
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
um

32
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,240
because she gets upset when she gets

33
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
left out of things

34
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,839
yeah

35
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,360
well plus i had to go shut the curtains

36
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,839
because otherwise she barks at everybody

37
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,399
that walks past

38
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
do you have a dog garden

39
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
yeah we've got a couple of dogs yeah

40
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,480
we've got a couple of dogs yeah but our

41
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,279
family uh pizza snake she's a lot more

42
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,640
she's she's a lot more quiet

43
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,079
i said with her on my hand and then she

44
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,240
like pops her head up in front of the

45
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,320
camera and everyone just sees a snake

46
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
every night i will i will lock that

47
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
background

48
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
for

49
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
um

50
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
i'm gonna let the last few people in

51
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,880
we've got 20 people that's pretty good

52
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
oh

53
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,760
more admittance

54
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,800
i will post the mural link again for

55
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,800
those that just popped in

56
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,399
so those that just arrived the link

57
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,640
for

58
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,480
the mural is in the chat uh we're just

59
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,959
doing the ice breaker i'm going to lock

60
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
the meeting uh when we're done with the

61
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,680
icebreaker um

62
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
so that

63
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
we don't keep getting uh people bouncing

64
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,440
around

65
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,279
because that was a problem last time

66
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,880
oh somebody's been changing their mind

67
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,399
oh let's see this is this is very uh

68
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,560
much more

69
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
what's the the contentious these

70
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,240
questions it might be the way i phrased

71
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
them maybe i've just phrased them badly

72
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
it could be weird it could be that i've

73
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,720
just phrased them badly right that's

74
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,279
entirely possible so when i go through i

75
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,760
can clarify but maybe i've deliberately

76
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,680
phrased them in a contentious way

77
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,120
so that we have a conversation ah that

78
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,920
could be my secret weapon

79
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
yes i did forget about four

80
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,480
don't worry it's just a question mark it

81
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,480
was meant to be like that

82
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
okay

83
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,800
ah thank you for the green tick on the

84
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
four for the question mark thank you for

85
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
that whoever that was gordon i knew it

86
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,200
was gordon

87
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
it's always gordon

88
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
okay

89
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,880
so cool

90
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,839
i got a couple more people coming in is

91
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,839
that unlocked again

92
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,120
there's some secret way

93
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,000
that people are able to grab things that

94
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,720
are locked in mural at the moment i'll

95
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,320
report it as a bug but

96
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,040
we'll see it generally it's good wow

97
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,200
we have a lot of answers to these uh

98
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,480
questions 23 people in the mural now so

99
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,440
i just brought everybody to the same

100
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,760
place sorry if you're removing something

101
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
okay

102
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
see many people have answered

103
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,440
somebody else got a dachshund

104
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,399
they they have this thing where they

105
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
just like to lick

106
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
yeah they're liquors

107
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
my favorite uh meme with dachshunds is a

108
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
dachshund did a barbecue and it says

109
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,639
would you like yours licked or unlicked

110
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,639
only joking i licked them all

111
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,000
i'm gonna have to put her down because

112
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,000
how is that getting dragged around

113
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,839
that's that's that's like that

114
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,240
background's locked and somebody keeps

115
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,800
managing to let me just delete the true

116
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
and the false background there we go

117
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,480
since it was uh uh

118
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
getting moved around

119
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,360
there's about a minute i think most

120
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,199
people have answered um so i am going to

121
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,040
i'm going to lock

122
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,519
i'm going to lock the meeting

123
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,800
oh one person getting at the last second

124
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,639
just as i was going to click the lock

125
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
button

126
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
let me how do i do this

127
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
there lock

128
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
okay

129
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
no one else

130
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,040
okay

131
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,199
right in theory we are not going to get

132
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,600
uh interrupted again

133
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,199
so let's have a a little look here well

134
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
this is a lot more contentious than i

135
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,360
was expecting it to be

136
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
um i'm i'm gonna blame wade for that i

137
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
think um

138
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,000
wade wade's

139
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,000
been a bad influence there oh

140
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,880
so um let's let's start from from one

141
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,760
and go from there and just um i'm gonna

142
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,079
see how much we i'm on a time limit

143
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,639
right so i don't want to go too long

144
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,519
so i'll maybe just give some answers

145
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
uh

146
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,199
based on

147
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
the scrum the scrum guide right so that

148
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,199
there's an answer based on the scrum

149
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,440
guide and then uh

150
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,560
there's maybe wiggle room right because

151
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,760
it's a guide not a rule book uh so if

152
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
it's a guide then there's obviously

153
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,320
wiggle room

154
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,560
so it says scrum teams must not uh be

155
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
bigger than 10

156
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
okay

157
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
uh quite a few people looks a little bit

158
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
like 50 50

159
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,920
on that one oh i can take the end

160
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,720
private mode there we go

161
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,480
i think if people created a sticky

162
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
uh then

163
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
oh maybe i shouldn't have clicked that

164
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,440
button because i've got a spinner

165
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,199
hold on just a sec uh but

166
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
where does it say

167
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,279
in the scrum guide

168
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,600
that scrum teams can't be bigger than

169
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,600
10.

170
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,880
it doesn't

171
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
doesn't say that at all right

172
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,680
might might teams bigger than 10 be more

173
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,160
difficult to manage might they more be

174
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
difficult to communicate yeah

175
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
right

176
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,360
um but a good example is the azure

177
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,399
devops team

178
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,920
teams at microsoft that's about 650

179
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,560
people or it was before the github

180
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,839
acquisition um and

181
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
they are teams of about 12

182
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
right and they seem to be able to

183
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
successfully

184
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
build build a product

185
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,800
um so it depends who you need on your

186
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,560
team how big it is

187
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
smaller might be better but it doesn't

188
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,600
mean it can't be big

189
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,720
uh so i'm just gonna what i'm gonna do

190
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,920
is i'm gonna just grab one of the

191
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,079
crosses and make it bigger uh for for

192
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,800
for my uh suggestion

193
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,519
uh scrum master is there to make sure

194
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,079
that the developers take enough work

195
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
and get it done i i like all of you that

196
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,600
had a cross

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
right that's obviously uh well not

198
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,560
obviously because one person said yes

199
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
right but it's definitely not the case

200
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,920
the scrum master is not there to make

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,079
sure anything gets done

202
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,279
they're there to facilitate it getting

203
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,320
done

204
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,399
uh number three the daily scrum uh the

205
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,279
develop daily at the daily scrum the

206
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,360
developers must each day say what they

207
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,920
did yesterday what they will do today

208
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
and what's blocking them

209
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,600
no

210
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,000
doesn't say that the scrum guide at all

211
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,759
no mention of the three questions uh

212
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,320
there you in the previous versions of

213
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,199
the guide it mentioned the questions as

214
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,079
here's how you might ask those things

215
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,160
right so it's definitely not mandated in

216
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,160
fact i would suggest if you're still

217
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
doing the three questions after 10

218
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
sprints your folks are probably bored

219
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,039
out of their mind

220
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,280
right so you want to you want to keep

221
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
changing it up get to the root of the

222
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,600
problem which we're going to we're going

223
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,839
to talk about

224
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,720
which is

225
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,000
understanding right understanding what's

226
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,559
going on uh each day so we'll come back

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,360
to that uh so from three we go to four

228
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,319
which

229
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,400
gordon you were right um he got a green

230
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,799
tick on there at five at the sprint

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
review the developers present their work

232
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
to the product owner

233
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
um no i can see uh

234
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,400
navlin shaking her head

235
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,679
um that is a big big no-no

236
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,640
the product owner is presenting what was

237
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,039
done to the stakeholders

238
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
right so i've been in d in sprint

239
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,559
reviews

240
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,919
where the team says this is how we did

241
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
something

242
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,160
a stakeholder says why did you do it

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
that way and the product owner turns to

244
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,520
them and goes yes why did you do it that

245
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,360
way

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,679
right that is not a team member

247
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,679
scrum team product owner is part of the

248
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
team they should be standing in front of

249
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
that team

250
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,480
and defending

251
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,880
whatever was done and seeking feedback

252
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,039
from the stakeholders and maybe we'll

253
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
take that feedback and maybe we won't

254
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,000
right because

255
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,799
maybe there's time constraints maybe

256
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,480
there's money constraints um it's not

257
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,440
it's not a free-for-all

258
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
right so that's that's really important

259
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,679
uh number six

260
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
uh you must be finished with all of the

261
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,720
things in your sprint backlog by the end

262
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,120
of the sprint uh the knees have it that

263
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,480
is a nice big x you don't have to be

264
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,160
finished with the doll

265
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,360
if we're on time

266
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,360
right if we if we have a fixed uh a

267
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,640
budget which is the number of people

268
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,000
fixed time which is the sprint

269
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,559
what happens when we fix scope as well

270
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,440
quality suffers right we don't want to

271
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,559
do that so the the scope is always

272
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
variable

273
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
in a sprint we may or not get to do

274
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
stuff

275
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,640
uh number seven the scrum master does

276
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,080
not even have to attend

277
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,039
the daily scrum

278
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,280
that is correct it is true they don't

279
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,160
even have to be there um i think the

280
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,720
wording in the scrum guide is they

281
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
help facilitate as needed or as

282
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,240
requested

283
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
right so they don't have to be there in

284
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,039
fact if they have to be there every

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,720
sprint that to me suggests a dependency

286
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,160
on the scrum master which is not

287
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
supposed to be there obviously if

288
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
they're a team member they're going to

289
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,400
be there because they're they're on the

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
team as well

291
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
at number eight ux work is separate and

292
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
should be done as a separate stream i

293
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,080
love all those crosses

294
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,840
that is awesome uh i am in 100 agreement

295
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
it's not a separate stream of work it's

296
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,320
part of the team's work it's part of

297
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,919
building the software just like

298
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,520
architectures you could put anything in

299
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
that ux

300
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,320
word there you could say architecture

301
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,919
you could say security you could say

302
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
what else could you say gordon pretty

303
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,440
much anything any type of work i was

304
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,799
just gonna be security because normally

305
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
that's the thing that people would say

306
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,080
like oh no that's some other folks they

307
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,360
need to worry about security

308
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080
yeah and then what happens when those

309
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,320
folks get your software

310
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,440
they think it's terrible

311
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
right

312
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,080
number nine product backlogs should

313
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
always contain user stories

314
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,080
there are lots of ticks there

315
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,720
unfortunately if you put a green tick

316
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,760
that is not true there is no mention of

317
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,559
the word user story in the scrum guide

318
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,320
user stories are not a thing um they are

319
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,520
might be useful for you or they might

320
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,960
not right but scrum doesn't mandate them

321
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,200
and number 10 last one developers commit

322
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,120
to delivering the sprint backlog at the

323
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
sprint planning event

324
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,520
i am disappointed to see all those ticks

325
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,600
i'm going to put a nice big cross

326
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,960
on that one they do not commit to the

327
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
sprint backlog because that would be

328
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,679
committing to scope

329
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,360
again

330
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,520
right we already had that question you

331
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,120
get the other one right but not this one

332
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,360
right because it's a common thing they

333
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,799
used to use the word commitment

334
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,720
during uh

335
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,039
the the sprint planning

336
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
and the word commitment if you look it

337
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,000
up in the dictionary

338
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,480
right means try really hard to achieve

339
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,799
it doesn't mean guarantee

340
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
okay but lots of people

341
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,760
take it to mean guarantee especially

342
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,679
spouses right if you've if you if you if

343
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,480
you made wedding vows right you made a

344
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,919
commitment it's more or less a guarantee

345
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
um but then

346
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,039
they change it to forecast

347
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,840
so that you're forecasting the work it's

348
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,159
a prediction of how much we're going to

349
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,000
get done and what happens to predictions

350
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,480
sometimes they don't come true

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,799
right and that's okay that needs to be

352
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,840
okay otherwise we're committed to scope

353
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,960
and quality

354
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,280
drops awesome

355
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,880
so that definitely uh uh helps me set

356
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,960
the tone oh that's predominantly x's i

357
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
only got one with a with a with a tick

358
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,799
on it that actually surprises me because

359
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,280
i was trying to

360
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,240
be more flexible but there's so many uh

361
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,520
um what they called uh

362
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
myths

363
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
david corbin calls them myths

364
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,039
about scrum

365
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,000
um and they're really common that's why

366
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
we get into a lot of trouble

367
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,799
and so we're gonna do a couple of

368
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,480
exercises around uh uh this idea of

369
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,400
scrum how come that says there's two

370
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
presenters

371
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
sometimes i don't understand teams

372
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
garden

373
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
um

374
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,039
it doesn't help that this is a beta

375
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,039
version of teams

376
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,159
that we're using my tenant

377
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,280
is in the beta place victoria yes

378
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,280
victoria's got her hand up

379
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,159
hello martin hello everyone

380
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,320
so my question has to do with the first

381
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,120
one around the number of people that

382
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,120
make up the scrum team yes

383
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,960
in the new guide

384
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,120
it talks about

385
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,799
a scram team being small enough to

386
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,559
remain nimble yes and

387
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
10 or fewer people

388
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,320
so yeah and it does say

389
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,720
typically typically it's 10 or fewer

390
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,679
people and and that is that is correct

391
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,880
right typically it's 10 or fewer people

392
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,200
but for example that a good example is

393
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
there's your devops team or the windows

394
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,400
team yeah at microsoft right they're

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,320
they're doing everything inside of the

396
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,559
sprint all of the security is checked

397
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,720
the documentation's updated the the um

398
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,520
it's ready to ship at the end of the

399
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,799
sprint and in fact they do ship at least

400
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,279
at the end of the sprint if not

401
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,039
continuously throughout the sprint

402
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,159
if you're there

403
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,679
what do you need to be sure you can

404
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
deliver that software what do you need

405
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,279
done do you need security work done do

406
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,960
you need documentation um do you need ux

407
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,919
uh what else could be in that list could

408
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
you might need compliance or legal uh to

409
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
sign off depending on the type of

410
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,240
software you're building if you're

411
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,559
building some financial software and

412
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,120
maybe you need some financial uh

413
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,039
knowledge in there on the team so that

414
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
maybe adds a few extra people you've got

415
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,760
somebody on the team who

416
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
who trained as a lawyer right but is now

417
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,679
a software engineer so they can help

418
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,679
answer those more complex legal

419
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,679
questions you've got somebody who

420
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,240
was a security expert or as a security

421
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,840
expert but also a developer

422
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,159
right how many people do you need on

423
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,919
your team to build working software and

424
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
i think you're right the phrasing in the

425
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,880
scrum guide

426
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
is that

427
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
your team should be small enough to

428
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,120
remain nimble

429
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,039
right

430
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,799
but also large enough to get the work

431
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,559
done

432
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
and that that's that balance how many

433
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,400
people do you need

434
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,400
on the team

435
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,200
uh so somebody is uh posting a little uh

436
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,279
message there on the side saying sorry

437
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,240
they can't seem to get into the session

438
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,559
yes as i posted a couple of times i am

439
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,559
closing it after 10 minutes um because

440
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,960
if we start doing breakout rooms it's

441
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,880
really disruptive uh for the breakout

442
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,600
rooms when uh people come in and out uh

443
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,679
during during the breakout rooms it's it

444
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,279
breaks the breakout rooms i have spoken

445
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,559
to the team about this and they do know

446
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,000
about it the microsoft teams team

447
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,559
so let's spend a little bit of time on

448
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,640
on scrum because i think we need to need

449
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,720
to get some some some knowledge in there

450
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,640
so the first exercise i'd like to do

451
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,360
is i'd like to do a it's a liberating

452
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,880
structure um called one two four all

453
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,120
we're gonna see if it works better this

454
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,440
time it didn't work so well last uh

455
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,000
session but closing the meeting should

456
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
resolve that okay

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,120
and what i'd like you to do is like you

458
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,840
to pop open notepad or the equivalent on

459
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,000
your computer it can be any way of

460
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,559
taking notes on your computer

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,240
and write on each line a list of things

462
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,559
that you know

463
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,400
you know of that's part of scrum

464
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,919
so if you use user stories i want to see

465
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,360
user stories on that list even though we

466
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,120
already said it's not really part of

467
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
scrum right it's not needed for scrum

468
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,080
but it's part of that story isn't it how

469
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,600
many teams do you work with that that

470
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,760
don't use user stories right very few

471
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,440
so uh um

472
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,640
create a list of items so i'm gonna put

473
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,960
one minute on the timer

474
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
for you to silently and on your own

475
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,240
create that list

476
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
the reason that i asked you to put it in

477
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,440
notepad

478
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,400
is that if you copy out of notepad click

479
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,520
on the mural and paste it will create a

480
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,080
post-it for each entry

481
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,000
right that way you can very easily

482
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
get it onto the get it onto the mural

483
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,720
so one of the things that you know of as

484
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,679
part of scrum maybe you've heard of

485
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,919
ceremonies or events

486
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,360
or roles

487
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,320
or

488
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,559
um commitments

489
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,440
there might be some

490
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,159
what else might there be gordon

491
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,720
roles artifacts events

492
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
accountabilities

493
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
um practices

494
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,000
some good practices there are definitely

495
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,120
some

496
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,120
there are bad practices too ones that

497
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
most of the time have a negative impact

498
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
okay so i um we've got exactly 20 people

499
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,279
i love it when the numbers are even i

500
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,200
did not

501
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,480
close the rooms just when it was even i

502
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,159
didn't do that

503
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,399
um so i'm going to create 10 breakout

504
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,279
rooms all right we'll see how this uh it

505
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,559
goes because um last time oh that was

506
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,880
really fast

507
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,240
okay so i'm quite i'm definitely in a

508
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
happier place that was really fast

509
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
creating them so i'm going to open the

510
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,559
breakout rooms you'll get a 10 second

511
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,799
warning and then you'll head into uh the

512
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,720
rooms and you'll be in rooms of pairs so

513
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,360
only be two of you in the room what i'd

514
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,120
like you to do is get your items onto

515
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
the mural right you can just copy from

516
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,919
notepad and paste and it will create a

517
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,679
post-it for each line and then merge

518
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
your lists together you know so there'll

519
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,279
be some duplicates get rid of the

520
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,279
duplicates merge them together create a

521
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,720
single unified list maybe add some more

522
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
things as you bounce ideas off each

523
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,279
other

524
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,799
and then after two minutes you'll only

525
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,679
have two minutes to do that so it's not

526
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,279
a lot of time and i'm gonna merge

527
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,000
two of the rooms together so you should

528
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,240
then be in rooms of four

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,520
okay if you end up in a pair and the

530
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,760
other person's

531
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,520
gone to get a cup of tea i'm sorry uh um

532
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
if you if you ping me i should be able

533
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
to pull you out the room and you can

534
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,200
just talk to me um but

535
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,799
that is always a danger so i'm to open

536
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
the rooms i've clicked the open button

537
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,279
there is no going back once i've done

538
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,880
that

539
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,399
um

540
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
and you should have a little warning and

541
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,799
then you'll disappear in about

542
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,919
10 seconds after that so you'll have two

543
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
minutes

544
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,039
in pairs

545
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,039
to merge your lists uh just pick a spot

546
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,320
on the mural there i'll summon everybody

547
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,559
there we go

548
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,559
um

549
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,640
perfect okay

550
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
so

551
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,520
right

552
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,799
so you on the if you're on the stream or

553
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,919
you're watching the recording you're

554
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,360
still with me

555
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,159
everybody's gone into their breakout

556
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,120
rooms um so they should be starting to

557
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,120
to add uh things oh looks like that one

558
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,320
hasn't gone well that paste oh let me

559
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,240
get rid of the

560
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,559
height facility to cursors don't show me

561
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,720
cursors there we go

562
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,039
um that way we don't see a lot of

563
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
cursors running around on the on the

564
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,320
screen

565
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,760
uh there's one room that's causing a

566
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
problem

567
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,279
uh

568
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,799
john and

569
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
soyzo are you okay

570
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,200
let me call you again

571
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,480
okay i'm gonna bring john i think you're

572
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
gone zoyzo

573
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,720
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna um

574
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,399
there's only 58 seconds left so i'm

575
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,919
going to leave john in there um

576
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,399
and then i'm going to

577
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,320
click assign participants and then this

578
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,480
is the mental thing that i'm going to do

579
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,720
so i'm going to forget about size

580
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,080
they've left that's the problem

581
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,240
so 10

582
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,200
merges into one

583
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,000
nine

584
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,320
merges into two

585
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
eight

586
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,840
seven

587
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,080
energies into

588
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,080
four

589
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
six emerges into

590
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,919
five

591
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,919
oh there's one person who's also left

592
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,480
okay

593
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,159
renata's left okay okay so

594
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,960
12 seconds and then i click the assign

595
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,640
button

596
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,240
and i've

597
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,200
broken teams

598
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,960
because if somebody leaves the meeting

599
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,279
then when you select them and try and

600
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,120
move them around it goes ah actually

601
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,559
gets confused so let me assign the

602
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
people i can move it's going to move

603
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,559
eight people because two people dropped

604
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,559
out

605
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,279
and half the people stay in their

606
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,360
meeting so let's see how that's doing

607
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,279
i'm gonna

608
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,279
add

609
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,279
four

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,640
we're gonna have to do some work to get

611
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
this mural into good shape

612
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
yeah let's

613
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,880
i am going to close that room

614
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,519
and close this room so one two three

615
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,440
four five okay so we've got enough rooms

616
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
we've got enough things

617
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,919
let's do that

618
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,440
i'm just helping out by

619
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,440
breaking things into

620
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
groups of things

621
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
there we go

622
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,360
so as soon as people click off

623
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,840
i can get it into

624
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,840
a set of post-its because we want a set

625
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,440
of post-its for one of the next

626
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,519
exercises we're going to do so it should

627
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,679
only be everybody's in the breakout room

628
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,240
just as on the stream on the recording

629
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,320
uh there's two minutes 50 seconds left

630
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,760
on the mural there you can see

631
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,000
uh so they're just creating creating

632
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,320
this list so uh some of them have gone

633
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,559
for for

634
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,960
accountabilities but we've got stories

635
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,399
user testing sprints artifacts and

636
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,399
comments these are good

637
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,720
uh sprint reviews this one's good as

638
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,159
well let me copy that um

639
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
all right i made that purple because he

640
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,519
was using purple there we go there's

641
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,519
your purple cards back again

642
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,760
uh

643
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,039
just sending a couple of messages uh so

644
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,919
we've got scrum commitments on the board

645
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,760
so i just messaged them and said um

646
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,640
try and

647
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,960
do it

648
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
try and change it so that it's a list of

649
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,399
commitments there are three commitments

650
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,079
what are they so what are the

651
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,480
commitments in scrum

652
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,599
uh with roles from accountabilities what

653
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,919
what are they

654
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,919
uh so we're starting to get groups of

655
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,359
things as three pillars

656
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,839
well there's lots of things coming in

657
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,839
based on empiricism

658
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,040
three three main artifacts

659
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,200
yep yep you're right there are three

660
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,440
main artifacts and they are the

661
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,440
uh

662
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,839
well they're not that so let me

663
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,599
just making some of these i know it's a

664
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,720
bit boring when you're just watching the

665
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,760
recording but i'm making these into

666
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,040
individual

667
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
cards because we're going to use them in

668
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,060
the next exercise

669
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,359
um

670
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:06,800
[Music]

671
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,800
in 24 seconds i'm gonna oh wow this is

672
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,680
i've got i've got to do some notepad

673
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,520
work now

674
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,520
let me split that up there we go

675
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
oh somebody's got jira

676
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,480
on there oh i made that dark green there

677
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,400
we go i'm gonna close the rooms

678
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
oh now i have to close them individually

679
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,720
because my all closed rooms is gone

680
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,520
because of the

681
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,520
people that were

682
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,760
so teams people if you're listening

683
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,760
if yeah so one person

684
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,480
it just negates the team actually uh

685
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,480
you could have various titles but

686
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,480
uh

687
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,599
yeah i was just gonna i was just gonna

688
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,720
go find and click the mute all button uh

689
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,920
just just um it is very easy sometimes

690
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,280
because teams kind of moves you

691
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,440
mid-sentence

692
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,599
uh and you wanna finish that thought

693
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,839
train um that's quite good i can see

694
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,839
there's a lot of things coming in it

695
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,079
looks like it was a little bit more

696
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,599
difficult than i thought it would be to

697
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,000
create multiple post-its when you paste

698
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,480
stuff in right it seems that some maybe

699
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,320
somebody's using uh um whereas i can see

700
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,440
somebody's making it into a straight

701
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,280
list

702
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,800
for that big one the whoever's the i

703
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,040
think that somebody's a raccoon the

704
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,880
green raccoon um is is is doing that um

705
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,599
once you've got them in a in a list you

706
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,839
should be able to just

707
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,920
select

708
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,200
edit it copy it

709
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,000
paste it onto the mural and it will

710
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,839
create individual cards

711
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,520
but that's a nice big list from whatever

712
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,280
group is that is

713
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,480
we have quite a lot of things on this

714
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,640
list we've got artifacts there was a few

715
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,119
things that were a little bit like

716
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,359
grouped like scrum commitments yes there

717
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,839
are scrum commitments but what are they

718
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,880
scrum accountabilities it rolls oh

719
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,680
somebody's get

720
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,599
user stories so we can just call that

721
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,760
card user stories there we go

722
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:29,839
uh scrum accountabilities

723
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
and tell you what i will copy that one

724
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,560
and

725
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,440
there you go with your

726
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,560
list i just sorted that out for you

727
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,200
uh

728
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,720
okay we have a lot of things

729
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,920
there's a lot of things here that are

730
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,599
scrambling all the things that aren't

731
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
scrum let's see i'm looking for

732
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,720
something particular

733
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,079
oh trello is on there i like jira jira's

734
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,079
on there

735
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
um

736
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
ah

737
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,720
one

738
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,720
has five values but didn't list them

739
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,480
let me list the scrum values

740
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,320
let me remember what they are there's a

741
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,560
little hint

742
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
here

743
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,200
focus

744
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,720
okay

745
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,720
so i've got i've got them here

746
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,839
for us

747
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,440
courage

748
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,520
respect

749
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,920
focus commitment and openness

750
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,800
the idea is that

751
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,200
purely with the mechanics

752
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
of scrum i know some of your engineers

753
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,680
i'm looking at you garden

754
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,560
right

755
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,520
um

756
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,599
when you're an engineer the mechanics

757
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,880
if you focus too much on the mechanics

758
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,040
you just end up with something

759
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,560
mechanical

760
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,960
but scrum is about people

761
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,280
and what's more important than processes

762
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,000
and tools and metunia

763
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,079
i did that badly sorry

764
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,160
chichi

765
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,599
i didn't hear what you say mutton what

766
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,680
what a see now i've forgotten because i

767
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,359
i garbled you

768
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,119
you asked what's more important than

769
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,119
process and tools yeah

770
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,440
interactions interactions

771
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,079
people and interactions

772
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,640
more important than processes and tools

773
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,560
so courage respect focus commitment and

774
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,240
openness is trying to encourage

775
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,320
those people and interactions a little

776
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,560
bit more right some of these are things

777
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,960
are quite difficult for engineers

778
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,280
um so we're gonna do a little uh scrum

779
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,119
circuit we're gonna use those cards that

780
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,800
we just created again

781
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,040
right in the next exercise we're gonna

782
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,040
do a little scrum circuit

783
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,040
and in a scrum circuit

784
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,440
um i'm going to create

785
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,920
five random rooms we did lose two people

786
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,480
okay that's how come i know at least one

787
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,280
of you ended up in a room on their own

788
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,359
um and that's because we now have how

789
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,200
many people do we now have

790
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,760
now i've got to look because microsoft

791
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,280
makes me do math 18 18.

792
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,520
that's including me and there's one at

793
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
the bottom at the bottom

794
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,640
yeah so uh what's 17 divided by

795
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,800
what's 17 divided by five

796
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,480
five i can create five rooms there we go

797
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
three points three points

798
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
thank you garden

799
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,599
see that's how you know gordon's an

800
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,359
engineer

801
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,160
right all the other managers they were

802
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,839
thinking three right gardens like three

803
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,720
point something

804
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,880
um

805
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,480
so i've created five rooms

806
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,480
it that when you go into your breakout

807
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,680
room at the top of the room you'll see

808
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,119
the room number

809
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,040
right so it'll say room one room two

810
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,440
room three room four one five

811
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,560
and you see i've got five stations wow

812
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,760
they match up perfectly right if if

813
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,319
it's as if i created that situation so

814
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,480
i'd like you to do is go to the station

815
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,839
that matches your room number so if

816
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,440
you're in uh

817
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,560
room five

818
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,200
um

819
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,480
you'll end up at openness

820
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,880
okay

821
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,720
and the idea is that you go to open this

822
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,599
and i want you to spend a little bit of

823
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
time

824
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,880
creating

825
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,560
some some post-its around here you

826
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,520
should be able to oh that's a massive

827
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,400
post-it create some small post-its

828
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,000
uh that represent

829
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,640
behaviors that you see in people with

830
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,720
the scrum values

831
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,720
right so what sort of behaviors would

832
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,920
you see around

833
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,880
openness

834
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,880
right try and be specific like a thing

835
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,319
that you've seen happen

836
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,760
um and how it serves or inhibits

837
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,960
transparency

838
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,440
right so sometimes being too open

839
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,920
right we've all got that customer

840
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,599
that if you're too open

841
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,880
right it has a negative impact on your

842
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,640
relationship

843
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,920
right gordon's got that customer i can

844
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,160
see that

845
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,599
right so you need to balance the level

846
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,520
of openness

847
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
with the level of trust

848
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
right how much do you trust that

849
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,640
customer to be able to provide openness

850
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,000
so none of these exist on their own but

851
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,640
i want you to think about in each box at

852
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
create a number doesn't have to be one

853
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,760
it could be two or three post it so

854
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,480
you'll have five minutes

855
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,040
in your station

856
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,119
that you start with and then at the end

857
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,000
of that i'll send you a message and

858
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,839
restart the timer for three minutes

859
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,520
and you go to the next station

860
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,400
numerically

861
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,200
right gordon yes when you're at five you

862
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,560
go to one okay just making sure you know

863
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,839
that i put a little message down here

864
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,359
just for gordon

865
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,440
go to station one

866
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,480
in the bottom right of that uh when you

867
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,040
get to five so it just loops round okay

868
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,800
so you'll see all of the stations

869
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,680
and if you go to a station where there's

870
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,440
already a bunch of ideas and post-its

871
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,520
review and you'll have three minutes to

872
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,000
review and reflect on

873
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,319
what the previous people came up with

874
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,359
but also change things that don't make

875
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,960
sense add things that you think of so

876
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,640
you're augmenting

877
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,480
each of the little

878
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,960
displays as you go through and we're

879
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,119
thinking about how the scrum values

880
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,119
affect the behavior of people on the

881
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,480
scrum team

882
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,720
okay people and interactions

883
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,640
so i will uh

884
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
click the open button so we'll get 10

885
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,800
seconds

886
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,280
hopefully this will all work this time

887
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,760
and i've added some post-its on there so

888
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,599
that there's there's some pre-made sizes

889
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,560
so maybe hopefully it won't create one's

890
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,880
too big

891
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,400
um so start at the station that's the

892
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,400
same as your room number

893
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
okay

894
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,520
five minutes send a message

895
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
uh five

896
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,640
room number there we go five minutes at

897
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
the station tomorrow so i've sent them a

898
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,359
message

899
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,800
uh we have

900
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,800
one person on hold

901
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,440
so

902
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,440
i'm not sure what will happen

903
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,200
in uh the

904
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,800
room if they're on hold they should just

905
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,760
go

906
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,599
right so microsoft teams team if you're

907
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,280
breakout rooms team if you're listening

908
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
if somebody's on hold

909
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,480
and i create a breakout room

910
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,160
put them in the breakout

911
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,240
because at the moment i get a little

912
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,359
exclamation mark saying that it couldn't

913
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,720
put them in the break-up room

914
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,240
participants currently not in the

915
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,440
meeting

916
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,000
cannot be reassigned to different rooms

917
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,240
right but that's not intuitive when they

918
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,400
come back they're now not in the room i

919
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,200
want them to be in the room

920
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,520
so even if they're on hold or they've

921
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,760
disconnected or

922
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,560
whatever's

923
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,440
i want them to go in that um room and

924
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,440
not

925
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,720
break stuff because it's just

926
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,000
unintuitive

927
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,040
that's my

928
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,560
thing

929
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,000
so hopefully hopefully hopefully you're

930
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,400
listening i'm not complaining i mean i'm

931
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,560
using using teams and it's super awesome

932
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,319
and this is this is feedback based on

933
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,800
the types of activities that i do which

934
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,400
i know are not the same as what

935
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,200
everybody else does

936
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,640
so let's get back to the scrum values

937
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,520
circuit

938
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,160
so we have

939
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,720
station one is off

940
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,480
on a rip roaring time so they're got

941
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,480
sprint review what didn't go well

942
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,960
uh

943
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,839
let's do

944
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,839
this is not

945
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,560
i'm thinking of how to augment room one

946
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,040
i think i'm gonna have to go to room one

947
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,960
and help them out a little bit

948
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,599
so i don't know what will happen when i

949
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,599
disappear in there so we'll see uh

950
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,760
opinion

951
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,880
so like if you think something is right

952
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,560
but it's not really the pop the popular

953
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,319
mindset or pattern

954
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,839
um

955
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,000
be able to say that it sort of talks to

956
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,000
that

957
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,440
so um i was

958
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
just popped in uh to say so some of

959
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,359
those are a little bit vague like

960
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,680
retrospectives

961
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,040
what what is the courageous behavior

962
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,119
that you would see

963
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,440
in a team during retrospect during a

964
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,839
retrospective what might a courageous

965
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,839
thing be

966
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,599
discussing what didn't go well

967
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,480
yeah

968
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,040
yeah

969
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,400
so for pushing or pushing back on any

970
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,480
commitments

971
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,640
so if someone wants to commit another

972
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,160
stories that you'll accent

973
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,920
and if they haven't looked at how it

974
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440
affects your testing you know you're a

975
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,560
tester you might want to push back on

976
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,240
that

977
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
and that's not always a popular thing to

978
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,920
do

979
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,319
you know always want to commit stuff and

980
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,839
get as much done but that just screws up

981
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,599
your velocity then because you can't

982
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,359
think too much you haven't committed

983
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,400
yeah so discussing what didn't go well

984
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,240
based on

985
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,440
expectations right maybe you've got to

986
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,720
tell a customer they're not getting the

987
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,960
thing they really want

988
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,200
that's that that happens right what

989
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,880
other difficult discussions might you

990
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,040
have in some of the other events around

991
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,440
courage

992
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,440
i don't

993
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,440
okay i should be back

994
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,040
yes i am back oh that worked quite well

995
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,400
that that worked really well going into

996
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,920
the breaker room so you still heard me

997
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,200
in the breakout room that was i was in

998
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,040
room one uh with wade and gordon

999
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,000
um

1000
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,599
so let's see how everybody else is doing

1001
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,839
keeping attention on the sprint backlog

1002
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,000
yep so focus is doing well

1003
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,200
um respect

1004
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,599
respecting each other's views and

1005
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,920
opinions it's a little bit vague

1006
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,200
keeping each other informed people feel

1007
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,200
free to contribute

1008
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,280
to contribute in meetings because they

1009
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,400
know their views and opinions are

1010
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:20,400
respected yep yep people contributing in

1011
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,960
the event um so what about commitment

1012
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,400
doing what you say you'll do

1013
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,400
supporting other team members

1014
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,640
asking all the silly questions cool

1015
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,720
so what should should happen there's a

1016
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,240
little bit of a meta uh discussion

1017
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,400
around this scrum values circuit um what

1018
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,040
i have 12 seconds left

1019
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,040
so at the end of the 12 seconds

1020
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,640
um i'm gonna set a timer for three

1021
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,520
minutes and message them to tell them to

1022
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,520
go to the next station

1023
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,640
so there's the

1024
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,920
bing bong

1025
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,920
gotta keep the airplane noise

1026
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,720
three minutes

1027
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,280
there we go go to the next station so i

1028
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,480
send a message to everybody saying go to

1029
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,800
the next station

1030
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,839
um and it's

1031
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,839
room plus one

1032
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,280
so i've copied that message

1033
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
so that they can uh um i can send room

1034
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,760
plus two room plus three so if you

1035
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,040
remember what room you're in because it

1036
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,559
says the top of your screen you know

1037
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,680
which one to go to and it helps a little

1038
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,359
bit and we'll see how how people get

1039
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,079
confused

1040
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,880
and

1041
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,680
room five goes to room one

1042
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,680
so hopefully

1043
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,760
hopefully this is going pretty good so

1044
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,839
that team went to

1045
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,960
room two

1046
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,160
so the idea uh behind this exercise got

1047
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,960
a few minutes

1048
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,720
the idea behind this exercise is that if

1049
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,680
i just tell people about the scrum

1050
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,200
values

1051
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,480
they won't they won't they won't

1052
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,960
remember

1053
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,559
half they won't even remember 20 of what

1054
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,480
i say

1055
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,640
so instead

1056
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,960
if they experience something to do with

1057
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,400
the scrum values they'll remember them a

1058
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,720
little bit better they'll remember the

1059
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,559
impact or they'll remember you know

1060
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,000
people remember things in different ways

1061
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,680
and so they're gonna

1062
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,920
it's this is a riff

1063
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,640
on the liberating structure shift and

1064
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,000
share that normally in a shift and share

1065
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,079
somebody stays behind to present

1066
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,760
the content that was created

1067
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,559
um but that's actually really difficult

1068
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,079
to facilitate in um the live virtual

1069
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,599
world um i do do it in some exercises

1070
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,280
but really only in private classes

1071
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,280
because i can't i can guarantee that i

1072
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,559
can pin people and move other people to

1073
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,240
the next room so i actually have to move

1074
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,079
them between the rooms

1075
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,000
um and that works better when

1076
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,160
everybody's authenticated in one account

1077
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,520
and they're online and all that kind of

1078
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,720
stuff

1079
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,960
it's same as in zoom by the way

1080
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,440
it's not more difficult in teams

1081
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,559
um it's just the same

1082
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,359
uh

1083
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,599
but this means that people get to see

1084
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,800
they get to create one right so they'll

1085
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,119
remember a lot about the one they

1086
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,400
created but then they're reviewing a

1087
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,720
whole bunch of other content and

1088
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,720
reviewing it with the same group that

1089
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,839
they're discussing as they go between

1090
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,480
the rooms so um they build a little uh

1091
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,800
relationship they spend about 20 minutes

1092
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,640
with that one group of people um and

1093
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,760
they're talking about courage and then

1094
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,599
they're talking about respect and then

1095
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,680
they're talking about focus and they do

1096
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,599
it one at a time and it it just builds a

1097
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,800
little bit more knowledge

1098
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,119
um

1099
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
so if i was doing this exercise

1100
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,800
like as a as just a bunch of groups talk

1101
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,599
about the events it probably probably

1102
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,400
would take 10 minutes right and

1103
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,400
next room

1104
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
message

1105
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,960
room plus

1106
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,280
two

1107
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,280
um

1108
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,680
it would take about 10 minutes this

1109
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,079
takes twice as long but i think it's

1110
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,680
more than twice as effective

1111
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,839
so i'd rather

1112
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,000
they understood this stuff because what

1113
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,960
have we got left on our timer

1114
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,040
um

1115
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,720
we've used 45 minutes so we've got

1116
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,720
another 45 minutes

1117
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,720
left

1118
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,400
ish

1119
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,400
um

1120
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,640
so let's see what we've got left to do

1121
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,640
while everybody's out in their

1122
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,480
breakout rooms so i'm gonna copy these

1123
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,960
post-its down

1124
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,079
and we're going to do an exercise

1125
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,559
uh with

1126
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,760
putting the post-its on do we require

1127
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,839
are they complementary do they have a

1128
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,200
negative impact uh that should be fun

1129
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,559
and then i just get the

1130
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,160
scrum story

1131
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,000
right so i may hit this a little bit

1132
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,000
less because we're time constrained and

1133
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,680
i suck at keeping time that's just the

1134
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,520
way it is

1135
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,280
uh i don't think

1136
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,280
actually we might spend

1137
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
we might do do we need it and then the

1138
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,280
scrum story and leave it there

1139
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,839
right we might not have time for this

1140
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,680
empiricism exercise

1141
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,920
which is around the events oh it's only

1142
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,880
20 minutes so maybe we will 20 and then

1143
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,590
20. oh that could work

1144
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,639
i thought that was longer but it's 5-33

1145
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,639
[Music]

1146
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,359
the second

1147
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,640
circuit that you do with people always

1148
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,800
goes better because now they know what

1149
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,800
they're doing

1150
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,240
let's see

1151
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,960
no because we get 20 and then 20 so

1152
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,920
there's 40 minutes left now

1153
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,920
and we've still got

1154
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,640
two more of these

1155
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,119
then this

1156
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,119
oh no

1157
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,240
if we can get done by 20 past

1158
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,079
we can do the

1159
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,040
empiricism if not i'll spend more time

1160
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,960
on the scrum story

1161
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,400
right because there was a lot of good

1162
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,559
the ice breaker had a lot of good

1163
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,319
questions

1164
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,400
i know i know i'm narrating but there's

1165
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,400
nobody else here you're really watching

1166
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,240
what everybody else is doing

1167
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,680
um so let's go have a look again at the

1168
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:34,160
things this is courage after um

1169
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,760
so this is the third team that's looked

1170
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,839
at courage

1171
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,359
and they've got asking for help saying

1172
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:42,559
no

1173
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,079
saying what didn't go well

1174
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,760
sharing your opinion having difficult

1175
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,200
decisions

1176
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,319
which items make it into the sprint

1177
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,319
backlog

1178
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,319
which tools to use as a developer yeah

1179
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,160
that's good

1180
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,520
station two oh we're coming up with

1181
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,480
another

1182
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,480
station change

1183
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,040
bing bong

1184
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,680
and then

1185
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,680
three minutes

1186
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,960
move to station

1187
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,599
next station

1188
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,160
and there's one more

1189
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,160
uh so

1190
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,640
station two

1191
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,000
understanding yep respect

1192
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,760
no judging

1193
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,640
yeah not judging that's a good one

1194
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,079
respect other people's time

1195
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,599
finger pointing

1196
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,040
being accommodating

1197
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,520
well there's a balance to how you have

1198
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,920
there i really like there's a book um

1199
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,559
called never split the difference

1200
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,119
um which is by uh uh the fbi hostage

1201
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,440
negotiator bloke it's really good

1202
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,240
um and sometimes

1203
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,400
being accommodating is not the right way

1204
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,480
to get to a good answer and and there's

1205
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,400
a lot of good techniques in his his book

1206
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,599
they're really individual well the way i

1207
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,359
think about the really individual

1208
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,200
techniques because it's a negotiator

1209
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,079
negotiating with either one person or a

1210
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,520
group

1211
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,079
um

1212
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,720
so it's useful uh but i'd like to see

1213
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,960
how that works within a a a

1214
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,559
the ideas work within a bigger system so

1215
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,920
you have you know a team of people a

1216
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,319
group of people who are all

1217
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,480
collaborating with each other how do you

1218
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,480
uh uh analyze that

1219
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,400
i'm hoping that i'm doing going to do

1220
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,359
some stuff around the

1221
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,359
orsk

1222
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,599
organization organizational systems

1223
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,200
coaching um

1224
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,440
and hopefully there's some stuff in

1225
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,680
there around that that i want to to do a

1226
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,119
bit of a bit of diving into

1227
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,280
uh treat as people not otherwise yes i

1228
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,240
saw recently a post online from a

1229
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,839
company i'm working with and the hr

1230
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,880
director uh was say it was it was an

1231
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,240
email

1232
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,680
i was saying

1233
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,280
sending email out to everybody and

1234
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,280
calling them resources it's like

1235
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:02,400
you've just

1236
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,319
called them all things

1237
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,480
right make sure time sheets are all up

1238
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,480
to date for resources and i'm like oh

1239
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,760
try and treat people like people re-read

1240
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,680
the things that you've written from the

1241
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,000
perspective of empathy

1242
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,319
and see if it still matches up

1243
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,880
uh so station three was focus

1244
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,319
so this is the fourth team through

1245
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,760
there's one more one more group to come

1246
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,760
through

1247
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,040
blockers are quickly cleared out because

1248
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,400
they're focusing do one thing at a time

1249
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,880
somebody's done about whip limits

1250
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,799
awesome um

1251
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,559
protecting the team from interruptions

1252
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:42,000
avoid multitasking

1253
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:45,359
good sprint goal concentration

1254
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,440
pomodaro yep my wife uses that

1255
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:50,160
a clear acceptance criteria knowing the

1256
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,920
value that the goal should deliver

1257
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,000
these are good

1258
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:58,640
right so 17 seconds left on this one

1259
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,079
and then uh we can go to commitment and

1260
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,280
have a look

1261
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,640
um

1262
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,079
i'm going to focus on the change for

1263
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,760
just a sec

1264
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,119
it's actually not hard to just can't do

1265
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,319
two things at once

1266
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,319
so the timer is going to go off

1267
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,720
and i need to wait for a sec and now i

1268
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:19,440
can do another three minutes

1269
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,520
little message

1270
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,079
for

1271
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,559
last one wee

1272
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,559
there we go

1273
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,119
so i sent that announcement out to all

1274
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,799
the rooms oh i've got a little message

1275
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,680
in the chat maybe somebody's pinged me

1276
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,480
and going

1277
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,480
we

1278
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,000
we need you oh no it's just somebody

1279
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,040
posted the scrum guide what'd they post

1280
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,599
yeah

1281
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,119
it's like commitment thing

1282
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,559
okay

1283
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,799
not sure what they meant but we'll find

1284
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,799
out

1285
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,000
okay so everybody we're back in three

1286
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,839
minutes i know you can only you

1287
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,359
generally only see me and then the weird

1288
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:59,119
teams thing uh below um i'm using

1289
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,559
uh

1290
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,559
ndi

1291
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,599
uh so teams has the ability to stream uh

1292
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,520
um

1293
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:12,079
the different feeds in teams out on a

1294
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,920
network broadcast right so tv studios

1295
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,880
might use that sort of thing

1296
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:21,359
um so i'm streaming i'm streaming that i

1297
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,359
have a tool i have the the ndi 5 tools

1298
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:26,720
installed on my desktop and i'm running

1299
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:29,839
their tool called screen capture hx

1300
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,799
which creates a network stream for each

1301
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:35,839
of my screens on my desktop so they're

1302
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,960
only active if somebody connects to it

1303
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,920
right

1304
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,680
um

1305
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,359
okay i had a little commitment let's go

1306
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,880
to open this

1307
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,119
it's only active if somebody connects to

1308
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,520
it but it means i have another laptop

1309
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,960
over here that's doing the live stream

1310
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,480
and it is uh showing

1311
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,240
this screen

1312
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,000
in the top portion

1313
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,799
and then um

1314
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,599
i've got the the me so this is teams

1315
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,760
local it's showing which is me and then

1316
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,720
the one at the bottom there is active

1317
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,880
speaker so it's only going to show

1318
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,799
if people have their camera on

1319
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,920
and they're they're i'll show the last

1320
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,839
person

1321
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,040
that's speaking that's got their camera

1322
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,599
on so the last person that's speaking

1323
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,119
turns their camera off you get that um

1324
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,319
if there's no cameras on because there's

1325
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,000
none just now everybody's out in their

1326
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:25,280
breakout room um you get uh

1327
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,880
that as well

1328
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,599
um it can be nice if it was just blank

1329
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:35,280
but at least you know it's working i

1330
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,280
don't know i it works for me

1331
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,920
so i don't see a lot of let's zoom out

1332
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,760
and see if there's a lot of change wow

1333
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,520
there's a lot of post-its right that's a

1334
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,640
lot of content that they've managed to

1335
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,160
create

1336
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,760
in that time

1337
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,160
if i just sent

1338
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,200
if i put them in groups of five and sent

1339
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,200
them out and said go answer the question

1340
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,680
of how the scrum values affect the

1341
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,960
behaviors here's a list of the values

1342
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,640
you would never get that much content

1343
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,480
they're actually thinking about it

1344
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,119
bouncing ideas off each other having

1345
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,119
conversations so i do five groups

1346
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,720
regardless of the number of people

1347
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,720
so in

1348
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,640
here in our breakup rooms we've got four

1349
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,280
four three three three

1350
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,599
right so it's a groups of four or three

1351
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,760
times up close the rooms

1352
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,520
um take about 10 seconds to close the

1353
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,440
ribs

1354
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,960
um but it

1355
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,319
it worked really well even if you had

1356
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,400
six people

1357
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:36,760
right uh five groups of six works fine

1358
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,760
as long as it's kind of scrum teams

1359
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,040
yes hi john it's martin again we're all

1360
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,040
back in the main room

1361
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,079
it can be

1362
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,160
i know it it can be a little bit

1363
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,839
confusing when it kind of surprises you

1364
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,359
a little bit you turn away and turn back

1365
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,119
and ever there's everybody there instead

1366
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:04,400
of just a few people

1367
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:06,240
and people like to i don't i

1368
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,680
i have my camera on all the time but i

1369
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,200
know some people they're okay having

1370
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,799
their camera on in small groups but they

1371
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,319
prefer not to have it on in big groups

1372
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,799
that's that's okay

1373
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,480
this is this is the the fun of the live

1374
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,599
virtual world

1375
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,400
um

1376
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,359
wow you guys created a lot of content

1377
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,799
if you zoom out a little bit

1378
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,440
if i summon everybody to look at the

1379
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,440
whole picture

1380
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:34,240
oh i'm sorry john if nobody was saying

1381
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,039
anything in your room you were in with

1382
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,119
uh simona and

1383
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,730
fiona i think

1384
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,920
um

1385
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,680
[Music]

1386
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,000
you will not get the same group again i

1387
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,799
create all the groups randomly so if you

1388
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,599
end up in a a negative group please ping

1389
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,039
me

1390
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,520
if you're having a problem because i can

1391
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:55,280
always jump in and

1392
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,720
see if i can figure out how to how to

1393
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,680
get people chatting

1394
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,839
um

1395
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,640
i think you should be able to act

1396
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,559
mention me in the chat um

1397
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,400
so just do that okay

1398
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,960
next time yeah because that's a long

1399
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,200
exercise to to have that way

1400
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,240
maybe they'd gone for coffee

1401
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,839
uh

1402
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,440
so hopefully

1403
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,039
hopefully you learned a little bit about

1404
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,599
the scrum values

1405
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,720
while while you were in

1406
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:25,599
your your your little uh discussions

1407
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,680
uh i went round and we had i chatted

1408
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,280
with the with with whoever is on the

1409
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,240
stream i don't think there's anybody but

1410
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,839
whoever's on the stream uh uh about

1411
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,400
what you were writing and how you were

1412
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:37,440
changing it um as you were going through

1413
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,599
as well

1414
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,760
and there was nothing that i i i didn't

1415
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,119
like these are all good answers to these

1416
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,599
stories

1417
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,200
okay um

1418
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,440
was there anything that surprised you

1419
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,440
wait

1420
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,400
sorry i'm just trying to find my ambient

1421
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,119
button

1422
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,559
um

1423
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,240
yeah there was actually

1424
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,160
i think i think one of the things about

1425
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,880
carriage is there's there's a lot to add

1426
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,880
but

1427
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,119
how different things actually overlap on

1428
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,960
each other as well because sometimes

1429
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,000
some items from courage will come into

1430
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,960
openness

1431
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,960
so you can get over

1432
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,440
as we move to the next station how many

1433
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,359
people

1434
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,280
write different things and you view it

1435
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,079
in a different way so yeah it was

1436
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,680
interesting yeah and that that's so the

1437
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,559
the way i've done this exercise before

1438
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,760
is i just say here's the five

1439
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,359
values

1440
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,000
go into your room and discuss the

1441
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,680
behaviors right and you get nothing like

1442
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,920
this amount of content

1443
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,359
um because it's just too open there's

1444
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,880
two there's too many choices and

1445
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:44,079
people's brains shut down um i you for

1446
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,079
those that were here last week you know

1447
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,440
i have a lot of board games behind me i

1448
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,920
have my green screen up just now but i

1449
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,760
have a lot of board games and it's

1450
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,839
if there's too many choices

1451
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,079
you get something called ap

1452
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:57,760
analysis paralysis

1453
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,200
right your brain shuts down and you

1454
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,760
can't figure out how to make a choice

1455
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,960
and you take a long time um

1456
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,559
this helps

1457
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,799
bring down those choices while still

1458
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,440
giving you all the options

1459
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,680
which is nice so i'm glad that when that

1460
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,520
that went well i like all of the things

1461
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,880
uh that are on here

1462
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,920
so i'm gonna do i'm gonna zoom out a

1463
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,920
little bit

1464
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,760
i have one last exercise i'd like to do

1465
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,960
and we're gonna go and grab

1466
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,200
the

1467
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:26,079
cards that we made before

1468
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,599
okay uh well maybe we'll grab them by

1469
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,240
there we go it's letting me grab them

1470
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,079
now so i'm gonna copy these and we're

1471
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:36,160
gonna bring them down

1472
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,559
to this uh this other exercise so let me

1473
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,610
this will look a bit weird first

1474
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,280
and then i'm going to

1475
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:44,319
[Music]

1476
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,720
resize to default

1477
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:48,799
hopefully that will work

1478
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,440
and then we want them let's make them a

1479
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,160
little bit better shape there we go

1480
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,839
and then pump them in a grid there we go

1481
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,640
we got a massive

1482
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:01,839
massive grid of stuff

1483
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,640
there that we created earlier and it has

1484
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:07,119
jumbled them up which is very deliberate

1485
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,839
um also i didn't have a choice but it is

1486
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:13,599
very deliberate as well um

1487
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:15,280
that i have i have um three columns

1488
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,440
here

1489
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:22,640
uh we have required by scrum okay things

1490
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,359
that are part of scrum and are required

1491
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,680
to create and maintain the system that

1492
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:30,160
it is it's an empirical process control

1493
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,240
system so what do we have to have

1494
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,319
right in order for that to function

1495
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,400
right like an engine in your car if you

1496
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:38,079
take out a part of the engine it doesn't

1497
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,760
function in the same way

1498
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,720
right so what are the parts that we need

1499
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,000
to function

1500
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,319
and then what are the complementary

1501
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,960
practices right things that we can

1502
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:49,599
choose to use

1503
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,160
that can be beneficial it won't always

1504
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,520
be beneficial that but it can i i was

1505
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,599
trying to find

1506
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,640
uh an example there which was user

1507
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,280
stories

1508
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,119
i i oh there is i found it see how

1509
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,880
i've done this before it's going to put

1510
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,880
user stories in complementary practices

1511
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,599
they're not required by scrum but

1512
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,440
they're

1513
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,599
definitely lots of teams get use out of

1514
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:14,240
it i have seen user stories end badly

1515
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,880
okay in teams i've seen it end very

1516
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,680
especially for api teams or

1517
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,319
infrastructure teams or i don't know

1518
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,400
anybody who's who doesn't have a user at

1519
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,160
the end of their story don't use user

1520
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,920
stories because it doesn't make sense

1521
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,319
you trying to squish everything into the

1522
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,680
terminology of a user story is not super

1523
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,520
valuable

1524
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,960
um so i'd like you to yep somebody's

1525
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,119
already started start grabbing uh cards

1526
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,720
and move them to the column that you

1527
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,680
think they should be in

1528
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,760
okay

1529
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,640
based on the the statement

1530
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,480
i'd also like you to there's a disputed

1531
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,000
area at the bottom

1532
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,079
if you

1533
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,440
see a card that's in a place that you

1534
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,280
don't like

1535
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,640
feel free to move it

1536
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,559
okay

1537
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,559
if it you're moving it for the second

1538
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,559
time put it in the disputed area

1539
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,400
okay that way you're not arguing with

1540
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,839
somebody over who owns the card we just

1541
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,640
put it in the disputed area and then we

1542
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:12,880
can we can chat about it

1543
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,400
or maybe you just put i think product or

1544
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,159
product manager might have ended up in

1545
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,199
the disputed area without a dispute

1546
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,839
because somebody wants a conversation

1547
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,560
that's a sneaky way

1548
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:26,560
in your infrastructure example

1549
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,319
maybe they're not doing the the cattle

1550
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,400
they instead doing pets so they're gonna

1551
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,400
have user stories because their pets at

1552
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,400
the end of it i think oh actually

1553
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:40,719
exactly i mean you can

1554
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:40,719
you can you can try really hard

1555
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,960
alfred sorry i just muted you there um

1556
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,839
uh

1557
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,000
so let's let's see i'm

1558
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:55,520
gonna i'm gonna zoom in to the required

1559
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,799
by scrum and just see if there's

1560
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,679
anything

1561
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,319
uh

1562
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,319
that i think

1563
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,560
anybody see anything in

1564
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,239
there that looks

1565
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,920
like it shouldn't be there oh looks like

1566
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,920
it should be there to me

1567
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,640
it's quite a lot of cards though

1568
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,000
we did create a lot of cards that's the

1569
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,960
advantage to having lots of people in

1570
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,759
the room

1571
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,759
don't worry about it

1572
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:29,120
if you do see duplicates do feel free to

1573
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,080
to delete and keep one

1574
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,440
okay

1575
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,279
um

1576
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,000
we could have done a de-doping exercise

1577
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:39,839
earlier but it just takes a long time

1578
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,560
what's an f15 or if is it f15 i don't

1579
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,560
know whether you mean

1580
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,839
like is ff-15s uh uh a fighter jet is it

1581
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,839
not

1582
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,080
sometimes when you create a card it just

1583
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,040
flips over and just puts f15 and

1584
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,480
even even though you've talked to

1585
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,040
something else i found that happened

1586
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,040
once or twice with me you you you are

1587
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,360
you are you're absolutely right i have

1588
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,280
seen that happen to other people too it

1589
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,080
doesn't happen that often i don't know

1590
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:12,400
what it is i think it's uh

1591
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,560
like like i say in all my sessions um

1592
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,239
mural is built in javascript

1593
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,360
and any of you that are engineers know

1594
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,360
exactly what the problem is

1595
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,040
okay

1596
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,719
wow we've got quite a few things in in

1597
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,840
in

1598
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,560
their

1599
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,400
complementary practices

1600
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,320
okay so

1601
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,480
let's have a look

1602
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,040
um

1603
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,080
i'm just going to

1604
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:43,760
grab everything in there and grid it

1605
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,679
there we go

1606
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,520
so it's just a little bit neater

1607
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,000
uh so let's see

1608
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,440
uh sprint reviews product backlog

1609
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,080
uh scrum commitments planning inspection

1610
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,000
daily meetings these are these are all

1611
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,280
all things that are required by scrum

1612
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,280
has three accountabilities i'm just

1613
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,520
gonna delete that one it's too vague

1614
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,280
right scrum accountability's too vague

1615
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,360
they're the the product owner scrum

1616
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,640
master and developers they're all in

1617
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,440
here somewhere

1618
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,040
um has five values we didn't list them

1619
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,840
so i'll keep that one

1620
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,560
um let's go to complementary practices

1621
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,080
uh there's two user stories risks

1622
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,320
sure risk management could be a

1623
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,920
complimentary practice it in the in the

1624
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,640
if you were at the previous session i

1625
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,280
did on introduction to agile we talked

1626
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,520
about how we manage risk in our

1627
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,199
empirical world right and that's by

1628
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,880
delivering working software at the end

1629
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,199
of every sprint that's how we mitigate

1630
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,280
risk because the variance is too big to

1631
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,400
mitigate it with a plan um but it's

1632
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,159
entirely possible

1633
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,600
uh epics issues

1634
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,880
load testing

1635
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,239
features

1636
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,320
ah i'm gonna put time boxes on the line

1637
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:52,000
right uh there's five events i'm gonna

1638
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,199
take that one refinement i'm gonna put

1639
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,199
that down there

1640
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,480
uh iterations

1641
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,000
adaption

1642
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,520
adaption and transparency are not

1643
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,920
complementary practices they're core

1644
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:07,600
practices take them over uh pbis

1645
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,760
backlogs so product backlog items are

1646
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,600
mentioned in the scrum guide

1647
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,840
right so i'm going to take them over to

1648
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,040
to required you need something in your

1649
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,400
backlog

1650
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,480
but user story and requirements

1651
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,320
are types of things that you might have

1652
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,239
as backlog items and that bit is your

1653
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,360
choice does that make sense

1654
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,120
right you're gonna have something on

1655
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,360
your backlog here's an entry on my

1656
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,320
backlog a unique distinct transparent

1657
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,199
thing

1658
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,040
okay

1659
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,159
in scrum we call that a product backlog

1660
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,800
item

1661
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,159
um and we definitely have backlogs so we

1662
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,280
can't have that on complementary

1663
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,760
practices

1664
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,840
and time boxes and refinement

1665
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,120
so refinement is mentioned in the scrum

1666
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,360
guide

1667
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:50,880
right it just doesn't have an event for

1668
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,000
it but you still have to do it

1669
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,800
so

1670
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,719
let's grid let's grid those again

1671
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,400
there we go we'll grid those over there

1672
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,760
and then in the middle we've got a bunch

1673
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,440
of complementary practices i don't see

1674
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,320
anything negative in there

1675
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,320
and then what was f15

1676
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:10,560
what was that 15 you remember waves

1677
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,600
that's why it doesn't support scrum

1678
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,960
i'm going to take it off because we

1679
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,840
don't know what it is

1680
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,520
um so we've negative impact we've got um

1681
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,199
tfs devops

1682
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,760
um i'm going to bring that down into

1683
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:30,800
disputed and i'm going to group it with

1684
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,679
jira trello and tfs and i'm going to put

1685
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,760
them in

1686
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:37,440
complementary prices right there is

1687
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,159
i don't like jira

1688
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,239
right

1689
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,400
i see jira quite often have a negative

1690
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:45,199
impact i sometimes see tfs have a

1691
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,679
negative impact on teams right tfs

1692
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:49,120
probably more than the people

1693
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,239
all the people than the tool that's the

1694
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,199
negative impact i yes it's the the

1695
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,640
people

1696
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,520
or the

1697
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,440
process imposed upon the people by

1698
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,120
somebody who's an admin in one of those

1699
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,000
tools and nobody else is allowed to

1700
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:07,120
change it right that's the problem like

1701
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,679
gordon you'll know um the the the the

1702
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,960
template that the windows team use or

1703
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,480
used to use

1704
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,640
for their work items

1705
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,600
had 200 fields required fields to submit

1706
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,199
a bug

1707
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,440
right

1708
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,360
exactly how many bugs do you think get

1709
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,120
submitted when you have 200 required

1710
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,520
fields

1711
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:30,000
but they don't have much bugs right

1712
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,080
wow so they've solved the problem solve

1713
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,040
the problem of creating bugs

1714
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,920
sometimes when we don't like something

1715
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,239
right we put too many things in the way

1716
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,360
one of the common ones that i see a lot

1717
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:46,320
in organizations is we don't want to

1718
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,920
accept changing requirements even late

1719
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,120
in development

1720
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,600
one of the principles of the agile

1721
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,520
manifesto so what do we do we put

1722
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,920
processes and procedures in the way of

1723
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,920
the customer so that the it's expensive

1724
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,760
or time-consuming for them to change

1725
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,560
things that are on our backlog

1726
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,080
right but we want to be accommodating

1727
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,920
collaborative

1728
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,719
uh with the customer

1729
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:13,520
uh user user testing um

1730
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,400
as it's described there i would put it

1731
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,159
in

1732
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,760
negative impact

1733
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:20,239
right uat

1734
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,360
user testing is something that we can't

1735
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:24,239
automate

1736
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,520
and we're going to want to do user

1737
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,480
testing

1738
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,719
but not before we're done not as part of

1739
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,880
scrum that might be our output is

1740
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,400
deployed to production and then there's

1741
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,280
a bunch of things that happen to

1742
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,199
validate whether we have been successful

1743
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,840
at delivering the right thing so user

1744
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,760
testing is valuable but not inside of

1745
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,120
the scrum story that's why i'm going to

1746
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,960
leave it in disputed actually because i

1747
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,840
don't want to put it in

1748
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,960
negative practices uh user stories i'm

1749
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,400
quite did somebody want to have a

1750
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,400
conversation about user stories

1751
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,440
they moved it to disputed yes

1752
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,239
chichi

1753
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,480
that was me um

1754
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:06,960
with the user stories i was thinking

1755
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,960
the user

1756
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,440
estimate the stories and then and then

1757
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,920
they they

1758
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,199
depending on what technique they use to

1759
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,159
estimate their stories they might they

1760
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,760
might give certain stories um the

1761
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,679
importance that it doesn't deserve and

1762
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,040
deserve and then that just brings the

1763
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,440
confusion

1764
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,920
uh between between them and wasting time

1765
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:35,120
on things that don't add value at the

1766
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,960
end of the day to the outcome or

1767
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,640
the product that you have

1768
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,480
and then

1769
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,320
um

1770
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,280
when they bring the the

1771
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,840
user stories um the estimation when they

1772
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,440
show them at the demo at the review

1773
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,440
whatever you you decide to call it

1774
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,840
that's the other disputed uh

1775
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,840
thing whether you call the reviewer demo

1776
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,120
or whatever you're trying to do

1777
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,440
when they when they show them to the

1778
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,800
stakeholders um it gives the

1779
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,800
stakeholders um

1780
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,080
the stakeholders will probably say oh

1781
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,719
you said you're going to do this and

1782
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,480
deliver this at a certain time based on

1783
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,920
what you estimated

1784
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,159
so that's the argument i was trying to

1785
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,320
bring forth on the user's stories yeah

1786
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,600
so it's just the estimation

1787
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,440
yeah it's the estimation that's the

1788
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,440
problem not the user's goals themselves

1789
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,600
i noticed we didn't have estimation so

1790
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,199
that's that's interesting and i'm

1791
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,520
actually going to

1792
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:35,280
based on that randomly

1793
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,440
that was actually that was my first item

1794
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,239
and then i didn't add it because i i

1795
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,239
don't know i was tapping all the stuff

1796
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,840
but i had i had only two items

1797
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:46,000
estimations and ceremonies and i didn't

1798
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,280
look at my list because we had so many

1799
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,149
things so i'm pretty sure

1800
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,149
[Music]

1801
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,960
yeah so the word estimation

1802
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,840
is not

1803
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,840
in the scrum gate

1804
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,320
no it's not it's not

1805
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,199
so so what do we call it then

1806
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,120
what is it

1807
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:20,640
so there is there is an activity

1808
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,920
after

1809
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,840
the so i i'm okay with estimation right

1810
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,840
so estimation is definitely a

1811
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,440
complementary practice

1812
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,840
we want to understand how much work is

1813
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,760
involved and estimation is one of the

1814
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,400
most common ways for people doing that

1815
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:41,840
right so it's okay to do that i

1816
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,719
doing estimation in hours is not wrong

1817
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,080
right

1818
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,920
there's no no there's no point in the

1819
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,120
scrum guide that says you are you are

1820
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,800
bad if you're doing estimates in hours

1821
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,000
right i don't like estimates in hours

1822
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,840
because i don't think it works and i

1823
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,480
don't think it adds value but some

1824
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:59,840
people find value from it

1825
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,000
the the we do need to um

1826
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:05,520
do some level of understanding of how

1827
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,600
big things are things need to be ready

1828
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,960
for the team to pull into sprint

1829
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,960
planning

1830
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,120
need to be ready

1831
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,520
right what does ready mean

1832
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,280
well it's not really defined

1833
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,120
in the scrum guide it just says things

1834
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,600
near the top of the backlog might be

1835
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,520
deemed to be ready

1836
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,760
right but if you walk into sprint

1837
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,239
planning

1838
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:32,400
and you as a team don't understand

1839
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,080
what your sprint goal is likely to be

1840
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,920
you don't understand

1841
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,480
what you're likely to be bringing into

1842
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,480
the sprint

1843
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,239
it's not ready

1844
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,120
what is the activity

1845
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,560
that's mentioned in the scrum guide

1846
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,560
where we would figure that stuff out

1847
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,360
that'll be the defined one

1848
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,800
it would indeed be the refinement

1849
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,520
refinement

1850
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,120
in scrum sometimes called grooming right

1851
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,880
and the old guides that used to call it

1852
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,800
grooming but refinement

1853
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,239
is that story

1854
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,040
around

1855
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,719
the team looking forward into the future

1856
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,840
what's coming up next not what are we

1857
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,280
doing now

1858
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,360
right that's in our sprint backlog

1859
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,639
that's in our sprint plan that's what

1860
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,920
we're doing now

1861
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,920
but what's coming up next

1862
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,920
right if you if you're if you're working

1863
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:33,440
on uh uh

1864
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,320
if you're working on a scrum team

1865
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:38,080
and you get into sprint planning

1866
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,400
and you realize that you need a new

1867
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,000
server but you've got a six week leak

1868
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,760
time for ordering servers because you

1869
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,520
work at gordon's company

1870
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,239
i'm just messing with you

1871
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,199
but uh you've got a six week lead time

1872
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,239
is that

1873
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:54,480
in time or is that too late

1874
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:56,320
it depends how long your sprints are

1875
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,760
what you could have two months if you

1876
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,880
get a six week sprint then you're not

1877
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,560
doing scrum either right uh if you

1878
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,760
didn't most people do two week sprints

1879
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,199
these days

1880
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,400
right

1881
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:10,320
you should be able to to to to get that

1882
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,440
thing within the time period or have it

1883
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,880
ready

1884
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,560
what happens if you get halfway through

1885
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,880
the sprint and you realize that some

1886
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,960
data that is supposed to be provided by

1887
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,480
the customer isn't there and that

1888
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,920
particular person that the customer is

1889
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:24,400
not going to be available for three or

1890
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,520
four days

1891
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,600
right

1892
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,440
you're not doing that thing

1893
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,719
that's too late to find out you need

1894
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,800
that data

1895
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,639
wouldn't it have been nice to know that

1896
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,400
you need that data six weeks in advance

1897
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,760
and ask them for it six weeks in advance

1898
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,000
so then you walk into the sprint

1899
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,320
planning and you're like oh we've got

1900
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,280
the data we understand what it is

1901
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,040
somebody's done the the the ux design

1902
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,639
it's ready to go we know what that is we

1903
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,719
know what we're doing

1904
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,080
so in that scenario is that is that

1905
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,440
where you get

1906
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,000
halfway through the sprints and then you

1907
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,920
realize you need the data or is that

1908
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,199
before the sprint started you knew you

1909
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,239
were getting it halfway through because

1910
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,639
you wouldn't want to take something

1911
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:04,320
that's volatile into the sprint

1912
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,400
yeah so i i

1913
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,960
if i thought that the data was going to

1914
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,120
be that might be made available halfway

1915
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,360
through the sprint i probably wouldn't

1916
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,679
take that item into the sprint yeah

1917
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:19,280
because i'd be thinking maybe it won't

1918
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:20,800
turn up right unless i actually have it

1919
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,719
we don't know how long it's going to

1920
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,040
take for that to turn up even if

1921
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,639
somebody's promised it right because

1922
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,400
what happens when people promise stuff

1923
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,040
outside of the team

1924
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:33,400
maybe it doesn't happen is there not a

1925
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,560
fine line between

1926
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,520
over-refining so coming up with every

1927
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,520
single

1928
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,280
conceivable action that you need to do

1929
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:44,159
in order to deliver that piece of

1930
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,719
functionality versus

1931
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:51,360
find out as you go as you go

1932
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:54,560
ab absolute absolutely john so um

1933
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,719
the the the guidance used to be looking

1934
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,159
looking about two sprints out

1935
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,920
into the future

1936
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:04,000
and doing you as the team's best efforts

1937
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,000
based on the risk of not delivering

1938
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,760
something

1939
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,400
right so you need to find that balance

1940
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,800
for your team there's no no hard or fast

1941
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,040
rules if if you get halfway through the

1942
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,639
sprint and you needed something and it

1943
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,800
means you can't deliver that thing but

1944
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:21,040
it's not that big a deal it's not that

1945
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,800
big a deal right but if you get halfway

1946
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:25,280
through the sprint and suddenly you're

1947
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,600
not able to release your product uh and

1948
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:30,080
it's a a good a firmware fix for a

1949
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,080
medical device that really has to

1950
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,000
we needed to know that first so it

1951
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,159
depends on the the level of risk that

1952
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,400
you're accepting and that the business

1953
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:40,400
is accepting how likely are we to get to

1954
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,280
the end of the sprint and have a a

1955
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,560
working thing if something's missing

1956
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,159
maybe we've got the engineering

1957
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,560
practices john that we've got feature

1958
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,840
flags and we're okay with testing in

1959
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,000
production and we're okay with

1960
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,920
continuous delivery but we can hide that

1961
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,760
feature that we built half of and

1962
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,520
couldn't finish this sprint

1963
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,120
right but do we have the engineering

1964
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,360
practices to do that and not just do we

1965
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,760
have the engineering practices but do we

1966
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,040
trust our engineering practices enough

1967
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,600
to do that

1968
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,600
right and again that depends on what's

1969
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,320
the risk if you're building firmware for

1970
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,560
pacemakers maybe that risk is too high

1971
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:18,159
to do any sort of testing in production

1972
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:20,239
if you're building uh um uh uh if you're

1973
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:22,960
building a system upon which your

1974
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:26,000
business decides or processes financial

1975
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,960
transactions maybe the risk is too high

1976
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,639
right

1977
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,480
um but if you're building something that

1978
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,920
has a lower impact

1979
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,639
maybe it's okay

1980
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,440
a really good good example is a a

1981
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,520
starbucks um the company i used to work

1982
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,159
with in seattle at northwest cadence

1983
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:45,520
with steve borg and they did

1984
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:48,239
work with starbucks and starbucks had a

1985
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:51,199
um expected planning horizon

1986
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:53,679
of 48 hours for their point of point of

1987
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:54,800
sale system so they built it all in

1988
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:57,679
house

1989
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,000
right and the idea is that

1990
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,080
not for big features

1991
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,840
right but if some competitor comes out

1992
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,560
with something that some offer something

1993
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,840
that they're doing that we can't support

1994
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,440
we want to be able to deliver that

1995
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,239
inside of the point of sale to every

1996
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,159
till worldwide in 48 hours

1997
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,679
so what what yeah exactly garden so

1998
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:20,639
there's risk in that

1999
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,639
right and we've all been into starbucks

2000
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,960
and the tales are down

2001
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,120
right we've all had that experience but

2002
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,840
the business has decided that the risk

2003
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:32,639
of the till being down

2004
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:36,080
is lower than the risk of losing

2005
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:38,320
customers to not being able to

2006
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,080
service that offer that thing

2007
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,239
the the the customer the wall but i can

2008
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,480
get that it it costs cost or i can get

2009
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:47,440
that at the other tillies or whatever

2010
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,920
whatever your other places

2011
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,600
and they have robust manual processes

2012
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,679
i've never not been able to get my

2013
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,800
coffee in starbucks

2014
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,719
right they can do a manual process and

2015
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,040
i've walked in with my starbucks card

2016
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,719
they can't take the money off it

2017
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,480
right i don't have any other payment

2018
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,480
options and they've given me a free

2019
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,080
coffee

2020
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,600
because starbucks would rather you were

2021
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:13,360
a happy customer and you came back

2022
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,800
then they lose the business

2023
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:18,480
so with robust practices around it

2024
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,000
you can support that faster delivery

2025
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,840
schedule but that's the whole business

2026
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,840
needs to support that from every angle

2027
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,480
uh

2028
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,639
so user test i'm going to leave that in

2029
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,920
disputed

2030
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,239
testing to be honest

2031
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,280
in terms of estimation i just wanted to

2032
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:39,199
add i think instead of estimation i

2033
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,040
think somewhere just mentions about the

2034
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,480
size size

2035
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,080
so it doesn't talk about estimation but

2036
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,840
it just mentions about size just add

2037
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,679
that

2038
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,280
yeah and i think you're right

2039
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,639
um so

2040
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:55,440
in product backlog it says that uh

2041
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,840
so refinement's an ongoing activity um

2042
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,239
and adds details such as a description

2043
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,000
order and size

2044
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,520
right to the things in your in your in

2045
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,560
your product backlog

2046
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,800
so

2047
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,639
it's you want things to be sized

2048
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,480
appropriately for the type of work that

2049
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,639
you're doing right and i'm definitely

2050
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,480
using vagaries here because there's no

2051
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,600
rules for how big should your backlog

2052
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,199
item be

2053
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,239
um should it be big enough to fit in a

2054
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,679
sprint i'd like that um is it okay if it

2055
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,800
doesn't fit in your sprint and we can do

2056
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,719
it anyway

2057
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,679
yes because otherwise how do we do those

2058
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,719
things

2059
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,000
right um is it okay to start a piece of

2060
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,280
work that's not going to be finished at

2061
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,679
the end of the sprint

2062
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,840
yes if your engineering practices are

2063
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,679
awesome if your engineering practices

2064
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,760
are not that great and you aren't able

2065
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,400
to create a working increment at the end

2066
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,159
of every sprint and hide features that

2067
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,440
are unfinished

2068
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,040
maybe you want to finish stuff by the

2069
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,159
end of the sprint until you do have

2070
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,199
those engineering practices in place

2071
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:55,199
right so uh there's definitely a lot of

2072
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:57,600
a lot of work on that but yeah sizing is

2073
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:59,600
is is a useful tool how big is this

2074
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,880
thing right because that's going to help

2075
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,159
the product owner understand whether

2076
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,120
they need to

2077
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,440
break it down whether they're going to

2078
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,600
do it at all right if it's a really

2079
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,960
expensive item to build because it's

2080
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,320
huge

2081
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,159
but it's only going to get them a

2082
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,120
limited set of value why would they

2083
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,239
build it

2084
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,239
right it's going to go to the bottom of

2085
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:20,719
the backlog or be deleted

2086
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:23,760
we're not going to do that thing

2087
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,679
so there's only five minutes left in the

2088
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,480
time box

2089
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,920
for this event

2090
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,159
i have no

2091
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,920
and i have no next meeting so i'm

2092
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:36,080
perfectly happy to hang out for for

2093
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,159
questions and stuff but i wanted to

2094
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,320
just at the end walk through

2095
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,520
um a story

2096
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,600
of scrum

2097
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,239
so i've got this little uh what i call

2098
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,360
this is my little backlog item here

2099
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,199
uh

2100
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,040
unlock there we go got can you see my

2101
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,880
little backlog item do i have to i'm

2102
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,920
gonna make it oh i'm not gonna do that i

2103
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,679
was gonna change the color but it

2104
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,960
disappeared we could see it and then

2105
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,639
yeah yeah that's because i tried to

2106
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,880
change the color and it disappeared

2107
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,560
that's a javascript bug

2108
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,239
and

2109
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,719
i did not change it to white i changed

2110
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:10,639
it to purple and it still disappeared

2111
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,920
uh so what what what what i'm gonna do

2112
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,639
i'm just gonna gonna

2113
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:17,920
like a day a day in life a sprint in the

2114
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,960
life of this uh uh this backlog item

2115
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,400
here

2116
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:24,639
right uh so at the the the start uh when

2117
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:26,320
the product owner comes up with it it's

2118
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,360
this massive thing

2119
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,920
that goes

2120
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,600
massive vague thing that goes and sits

2121
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,679
in the product backlog

2122
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,360
right um we're gonna the product owner

2123
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,040
is gonna have this some discussions in

2124
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,639
the business around it they may be if

2125
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,000
it's really big they maybe have to do a

2126
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,560
business case right how are we going to

2127
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,320
fund this are we going to pay for it

2128
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,960
and then maybe he thinks about breaking

2129
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,960
it down into lots of smaller items so we

2130
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,400
get a bunch of smaller items here's

2131
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,280
here's one of the smaller items that

2132
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,040
we're going to look at so as

2133
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,480
it gets closer to the top of the backlog

2134
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:59,840
at some point the product owner is going

2135
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:03,199
to say i am okay

2136
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:05,440
with the team spending time on this

2137
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,120
right i want to pay for it

2138
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,520
so then the team's going to bring it in

2139
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,800
scope for their refinement

2140
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,080
it's going to talk about it they're

2141
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,639
going to discuss it they're going to add

2142
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,320
some details they may have conversations

2143
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,400
and questions for the product owner or

2144
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,639
other people in the business and this is

2145
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,560
going to slowly drift towards the top of

2146
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,880
the product backlog and become ready so

2147
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,000
that was its refinement it's refined to

2148
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,520
ready

2149
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,880
right but you don't refine stuff that

2150
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,120
the product owner is not willing to pay

2151
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,120
for

2152
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:35,360
because that's cost you

2153
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:37,920
money and then

2154
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,920
we also have a product goal

2155
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,520
for our product backlog that's our

2156
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,920
commitment

2157
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,679
to the product backlog but it informs

2158
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,480
the product backlog it does not control

2159
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,920
it

2160
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,600
right it's okay to have things in the

2161
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,800
product backlog that are not to do with

2162
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,159
the product goal but the product goal

2163
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,199
provides us focus and we want to

2164
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:57,280
maximize focus so you can figure out how

2165
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:59,280
to how to do that

2166
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,560
then at some point the team heads into

2167
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,520
sprint planning

2168
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,159
and

2169
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,639
this item this item's actually not to do

2170
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:08,159
with the goal it's a little uh a little

2171
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,280
side thing that they're going to do so

2172
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:11,040
they're going to bring it into sprint

2173
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,960
planning they've already sized and

2174
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,800
estimated their things towards their

2175
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,960
sprint goal they've created a sprint

2176
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,880
goal and this is an extra thing they're

2177
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,639
doing as you know some customers have

2178
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,480
been asking for it it's a little small

2179
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,239
thing it's not something that's going to

2180
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,760
impact our sprint goal we can take it on

2181
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:27,600
anyway so they bring it bring it into

2182
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,560
the into the sprint

2183
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,719
uh they planned out uh they create an

2184
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,840
actionable plan for at least the first

2185
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:37,840
24 hours and it ends up assigned to

2186
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,679
their sprint back clock so it's not

2187
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,120
towards the goal but it's within the

2188
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,480
scope of the sprint

2189
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,080
we're going to do it anyway there's this

2190
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,600
item and there's a couple of bugs and

2191
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,840
then there's five or six things that are

2192
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,560
to do with the goal in our sprint and

2193
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,320
we've got plan for the first 24 hours

2194
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,600
we then every day

2195
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,040
we're gonna work

2196
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,560
right we're gonna work for we're not

2197
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:59,520
gonna work for 24 hours but you know

2198
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,000
that story we the next 24 hours later

2199
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,040
we're gonna do our daily scrum

2200
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,000
in our daily scrum we're going to review

2201
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,000
our progress towards our sprint goal

2202
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and create an actionable plan for the

2203
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
next 24 hours right what are we going to

2204
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,719
do in the next 24 hours does our sprint

2205
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,560
back clock still reflect transparency of

2206
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,480
the present

2207
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,080
right are we still on track to achieve

2208
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,520
our sprint goal

2209
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,880
those are the sort of questions we're

2210
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,719
going to answer so you'll they go around

2211
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,040
this loop every day

2212
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,120
right keeping this sprint back clog

2213
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,760
trans as transparent as possible it

2214
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,040
reflects reality

2215
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,960
and then somewhere near the end of the

2216
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,679
sprint or maybe at any time during the

2217
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,440
sprint they have an increment

2218
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:43,199
right there's an expression that an

2219
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,800
increment is born

2220
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,880
when the product meets the definition of

2221
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,719
done i kind of like that expression but

2222
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,080
it needs a lot of unpacking to really

2223
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,000
understand it

2224
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,360
what it really means is at least once

2225
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,679
per sprint

2226
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,280
you have all of the work that you've

2227
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:59,679
been doing plus everything that went

2228
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:01,440
before meets the definition of done and

2229
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,520
we say this is a working version of our

2230
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,360
product

2231
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,960
right that's our increment so it meets

2232
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,840
the definition of done and this the

2233
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,840
story's part of it

2234
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:16,480
and then we're going to review it

2235
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,000
right this is where uh uh and jumunya

2236
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:20,400
was talking about the i got it right

2237
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,600
that time uh was talking about or at

2238
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:26,239
least close enough it was talking about

2239
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,639
uh the demo you might do a demo as part

2240
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:31,199
of your sprint review you also might not

2241
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:33,600
right you don't have to do a demo i know

2242
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:36,400
plenty of teams that don't do demos

2243
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,000
but we want to reflect on the product

2244
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,480
that we have

2245
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,239
and update you can see that little line

2246
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,679
coming out at the bottom of the sprint

2247
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,080
review

2248
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,480
we're reflecting on the product backlog

2249
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:51,120
does the product backlog still reflect

2250
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:53,360
transparency of the future

2251
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,800
right does it still mean what we need to

2252
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,880
do next

2253
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,480
that's the purpose of the sprint review

2254
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,000
based on the work we've just done over

2255
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,280
the last two weeks

2256
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,560
how do we need to change the product

2257
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:06,320
back clouds so it still reflects

2258
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,320
transparency so we know what's next

2259
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:11,760
right everything else

2260
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,000
is a complementary practice

2261
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,760
doing a demo complimentary practice

2262
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,760
answering the the questions

2263
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,719
complementary practice right it's no

2264
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,410
problem wade uh thank you for for being

2265
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,840
here thanks very much very much

2266
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:25,920
[Music]

2267
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:29,280
right and then at the end of the sprint

2268
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,880
review when you've reviewed the products

2269
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,800
we go into

2270
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,159
a sprint retro but we don't take the

2271
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,800
backlog item with us i'll put it back

2272
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:38,880
over here we go into our sprint retro

2273
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,280
and we figure out is there something we

2274
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,800
could have done better

2275
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:46,080
is there something that we can do to

2276
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,440
make our team more effective

2277
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,040
right and that could be at the team

2278
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,639
level it could be at the product level

2279
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,239
it could be the organization level it

2280
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,000
could be at the tools level it could be

2281
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,600
at the relationships level you know

2282
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,760
martin and gordon are arguing all the

2283
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,520
time over um how they want to store

2284
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,400
items and azure devops that's cool all

2285
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,520
right

2286
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,960
um

2287
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,639
how's house

2288
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:08,239
gordon and i are both devops mvps um so

2289
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,400
we spent a lot of time with azure devops

2290
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:11,760
that's why um that's a kind of in-joke

2291
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,560
there

2292
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,400
but

2293
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,960
we reflect on how we do things how we

2294
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,960
work together

2295
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,679
and hopefully we have maybe some

2296
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,960
improvements that might come into the

2297
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,639
next print

2298
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,560
and we do it again and we keep going

2299
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,840
around that loop

2300
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,360
so we have

2301
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,560
in in

2302
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,320
yellow there

2303
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:34,400
i have the three

2304
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:36,400
transparencies right the artifacts

2305
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,880
product backlog sprint backlog and

2306
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,080
increment and each one of them has a

2307
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,520
commitment

2308
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,280
to that item

2309
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,960
the product backlog's commitment is the

2310
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,280
product goal the sprint backlog's

2311
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,880
commitment is the sprint goal

2312
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,280
and the increments commitment is

2313
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,800
definition of done

2314
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:55,440
right that's our commitments to our

2315
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,639
transparency

2316
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:59,440
and then we have

2317
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:01,760
four moments to inspect and adapt sprint

2318
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,600
planning daily scrum sprint review and

2319
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,679
retrospective

2320
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,280
sprint planning inspect and adapt on the

2321
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:10,080
product backlog to create the sprint

2322
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,440
back clock daily scrum we're inspecting

2323
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,360
the sprint backlog and adapting the

2324
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,600
sprint back clock the review we're

2325
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:17,280
inspecting the increment and adapting

2326
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,280
the product backlog and in the

2327
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:22,760
retrospective we're inspecting and

2328
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,760
adapting ourselves

2329
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:29,360
question or unpopular opinion

2330
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:31,760
potentially with the

2331
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:33,840
the sprint duration

2332
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,560
out of a sprint retrospective

2333
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,159
one of those items being that we need to

2334
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,719
increase or decrease the length of our

2335
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,880
sprint based on what we know the the

2336
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,320
future looks like so near the beginning

2337
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,719
potentially three-week sprints because

2338
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:49,040
you're laying down a lot of foundation

2339
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,560
but as you move into smaller stuff

2340
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,040
where you generally be taking more into

2341
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,560
a sprint to create more focus you bring

2342
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,560
the duration of the sprint smaller

2343
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,600
that's okay

2344
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,520
so there's nothing i i think it's

2345
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,679
dangerous right

2346
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,360
and i've seen that work really badly for

2347
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,119
teams but if you know what you're doing

2348
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,560
you're you're you're looking at the work

2349
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:12,080
you're doing and you're like we can make

2350
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,440
our sprint shorter and get a tighter

2351
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,400
feedback loop

2352
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,880
awesome

2353
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,199
right that is an okay change to make

2354
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,639
um i would be worried if a team was

2355
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,400
changing their sprint length every

2356
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:24,960
sprint right

2357
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,159
um that would that would worry me but

2358
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,760
it's it's

2359
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:31,199
just super fine to to to change uh uh

2360
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,040
the length of your sprint you go from

2361
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:35,040
four weeks to three weeks to two weeks

2362
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:38,000
to one week yeah

2363
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,159
the the i hear or at least i heard many

2364
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,280
moons ago that the azure

2365
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:46,960
team that managed the software that

2366
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,480
controls azure and did daily sprints

2367
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,800
so they deployed to production at the

2368
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:52,800
end of every day um and decided what

2369
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,880
they were going to work on that morning

2370
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,360
and they had to stand up every hour

2371
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,600
i stand up every year

2372
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:02,080
that's the only bit i know i mean yeah

2373
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,199
totally it totally totally could be but

2374
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,760
i mean that's

2375
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:08,400
when when i do when i do training

2376
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:11,360
right we do um either 30 minute sprints

2377
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,760
or 120 minutes sprints i think it's 75

2378
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:16,000
minutes of work or 30 minutes of work um

2379
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,840
and yeah that's that the teams that do

2380
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,639
really well

2381
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,960
will

2382
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,679
you know every five minutes let's say in

2383
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,920
a 30-minute sprint they have a quick

2384
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,239
quick check right is everybody okay does

2385
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,520
anybody need any help

2386
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:32,080
right are we are we still getting the

2387
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,480
stuff okay right let's let's go it takes

2388
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,920
a few seconds to have that conversation

2389
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,920
but somebody who was sitting there

2390
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,040
noodling on something goes up no i can i

2391
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,119
get some help

2392
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,880
right let's help that person and then

2393
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:45,119
we don't blow our 30-minute sprint

2394
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,920
that's a short sprint by the way

2395
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:48,480
yeah

2396
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,480
and obviously you said that there was

2397
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,840
you know there was the singular

2398
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,600
increment

2399
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,080
or you didn't say that was the singular

2400
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,080
increment

2401
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:12,159
yes absolutely so um

2402
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:16,080
there's a detachment that happens once

2403
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:18,480
teams get enough uh get a

2404
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,320
good enough engineering practices where

2405
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,800
they're able to detach the planning

2406
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,040
cadence which is your sprints

2407
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,639
from the delivery cadence which is your

2408
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,480
engineering practices

2409
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,920
um so the the way that i usually see

2410
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,080
that work is teams move towards

2411
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,679
continuous delivery right every commit

2412
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,600
that makes it into master that passes

2413
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,199
all the checks ends up in production

2414
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,960
right so they're continuously delivering

2415
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,480
to production meeting all the checks

2416
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,080
meeting their definition of done with

2417
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,840
every single

2418
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,280
ship to production but they still have

2419
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,040
that two-week

2420
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,560
planning cadence where they're

2421
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,840
interacting with the business on that

2422
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,280
planning cadence they're getting people

2423
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,600
into their review on that planning

2424
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:55,760
cadence um the azure devops team are a

2425
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,920
good example of that although they they

2426
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,400
talk about three-week sprints

2427
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,320
right so three weeks

2428
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,719
deployment first release although they

2429
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:06,239
are releasing when they do a deployment

2430
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:07,920
to the outside world they're releasing

2431
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,360
every three weeks but that's just as a

2432
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,880
ceremony where they say this is the

2433
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,719
changes for the last three the changes

2434
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,320
we've made in the last three weeks yeah

2435
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:16,080
yeah most of them are already in

2436
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,320
production they have a small number of

2437
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:20,159
changes that they have to fit into that

2438
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:23,280
rolling three week

2439
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:25,199
because they're they've managed to micro

2440
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,760
service a lot of stuff right and all the

2441
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:29,280
micro services and satellite systems are

2442
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,719
all working on that continuous delivery

2443
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:33,040
cadence but then there's that bit that

2444
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:35,199
used to be tfs in the middle the big

2445
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:38,000
ball of fur they get hacked up by the

2446
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:40,159
cat and it still needs a much more

2447
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,800
controlled deployment much more

2448
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:45,840
deliberate much more checks so they do

2449
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,320
that over a a a rolling a longer rolling

2450
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,639
deployment um so they might need to put

2451
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,560
some stuff features on there and they

2452
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,760
can only turn on the feature

2453
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,480
once both

2454
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,080
parts are shipped right once both parts

2455
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,400
are in production you've got the the

2456
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:02,320
rolling feature update where you've got

2457
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,800
once every three weeks or it takes three

2458
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,400
weeks to actually deploy it and then

2459
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,639
you've got the other stuff

2460
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,480
i and you see it as well in in microsoft

2461
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:12,560
teams if you're a microsoft teams user

2462
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,920
and you'll see that you can be sitting

2463
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,280
next to somebody who has different

2464
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,239
features from you

2465
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:20,239
because they roll out features um in a

2466
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:22,480
ring-based controlled exposure to

2467
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:24,320
production system so not everybody

2468
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,600
inside of a tenant gets the features at

2469
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,520
the same time because there might be a

2470
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,199
hundred thousand people inside of a

2471
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,760
company right maybe three hundred

2472
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:33,760
thousand people and what's tata tartar's

2473
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,639
got like

2474
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:38,239
600 000 people working for them right

2475
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:40,159
they're all inside of one

2476
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:41,119
tenant you can't just turn features on

2477
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,400
for

2478
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,679
more than half a million people and

2479
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,600
expect everything to be happy you've got

2480
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:48,080
to roll it out slowly so that you can

2481
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,400
see the performance impact you can see

2482
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:52,000
all of those things

2483
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,600
yeah like that

2484
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,040
that's slow rolled out this is like one

2485
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,800
of the things that i think is from one

2486
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:58,400
of the builds probably like six years

2487
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,440
ago or something like that

2488
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,639
where they

2489
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,080
switched it on

2490
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:03,840
like as they announced that they

2491
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:06,239
switched it out yeah and then it wasn't

2492
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,000
available for anyone because

2493
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,840
the system just kicking in and then

2494
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,600
people accessing it like it ended up

2495
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,320
bringing the system down

2496
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,159
it's not just the the the um there's

2497
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,199
your devops team that had that problem

2498
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:19,679
yeah all

2499
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:21,199
uh uh the the the teams at microsoft

2500
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,280
have had that problem in some shape or

2501
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:25,600
another of they've they've turned

2502
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,880
something on when it's been announced at

2503
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,639
the conference

2504
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,719
right and it's just taking out the

2505
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:32,880
entire system because something's up or

2506
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,719
too many people hit it at the same time

2507
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,639
and so i i hear garden that there's now

2508
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,880
a rule inside of microsoft that you're

2509
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,000
not allowed to present any feature a

2510
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,440
conference unless it's been in

2511
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,199
production for at least 48 hours before

2512
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,040
you announce it right and that's the

2513
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,920
mitigate that's to mitigate that problem

2514
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,679
yeah

2515
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,520
you've got a chance to kick the tires on

2516
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,600
it i mean generally like i mean if you

2517
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,199
just browse around like the maximum

2518
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,880
state like the week before a major

2519
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,960
conference you'll start seeing stuff

2520
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,560
that you don't know about because

2521
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,000
it's about yeah

2522
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,239
yeah it's about to be announced and that

2523
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
you got to kick the tires right i i'm

2524
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:08,719
i'm running on windows 11 and it doesn't

2525
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,679
ship for how long does to windows 6 11

2526
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:13,840
ships like it's october or something

2527
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,199
yeah somewhere around there yeah running

2528
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,080
windows 11

2529
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,280
yeah

2530
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,040
some interesting things the first

2531
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,560
release we had

2532
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,400
was the taskbar

2533
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,920
this taskbar showed on the other screen

2534
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:26,159
but you couldn't get any of your windows

2535
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,679
with your icons so like if you drag

2536
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:30,719
something you just lost it

2537
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:32,639
so so i think i think it it's

2538
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:34,480
it's important one one of the one of the

2539
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,600
complementary practices that i really

2540
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,880
recommend

2541
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,280
there's a we're talking a little bit of

2542
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,360
engineering stuff i know for example uh

2543
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,600
uh uh eki's maybe a little bit less

2544
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,880
interested in the engineering side maybe

2545
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:49,440
uh and with engineering as well but um

2546
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:51,920
the the the

2547
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:53,520
that controlled exposure to production

2548
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:57,360
is one of those advanced engineering

2549
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:59,920
practices that allows teams

2550
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,719
to continuously deliver to production

2551
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,639
and

2552
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,960
do something called testing in

2553
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,639
production which sounds scary and it's

2554
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,239
supposed to be scary because you need

2555
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:12,480
good engineering practices to do it you

2556
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:12,480
can't just uh you can't just do that

2557
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,199
well i'm gonna i'm gonna uh

2558
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:20,560
wrap it up for the

2559
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:22,239
people that would like to go just now

2560
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:26,719
i'm going to leave this diagram up i'm

2561
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:27,920
going to pdf uh the the the mural um and

2562
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,159
i'm going to

2563
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:33,280
um send it out for everybody that that

2564
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:36,080
signed up um obviously the video is

2565
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:39,840
when i hit end it will already be on the

2566
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:44,320
live stream i have already scheduled

2567
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:46,080
next to gordon what time is it for you

2568
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,960
uh

2569
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,719
oh

2570
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,560
dear you tired

2571
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:53,520
you had a long day

2572
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:56,480
it was a very long day you need water

2573
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:59,360
you need some water yeah

2574
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:01,520
so um the session in two weeks is going

2575
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,159
to be a little bit later because i'm

2576
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:07,600
teaching a psm class during the day that

2577
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:09,520
finishes at five so it'll be 5 30 uh utc

2578
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,600
plus one

2579
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,920
whatever that makes it for you um if you

2580
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,520
go to my website it will

2581
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,600
convert it to lots of different time

2582
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,080
zones for you which will make it easier

2583
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:22,480
um and it's on linkedin as well and it's

2584
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:24,000
an introduction to kanban

2585
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:26,400
and flow

2586
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,960
um so we're gonna gonna do do some

2587
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:31,600
exercises around kanban and flow

2615
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:38,480
feedback i would love for you to add you

2616
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,960
know one of the things that worked well

2617
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,560
um what do i need to change

2618
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:46,560
uh new ideas and unanswered questions i

2619
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,400
think teams worked better this time did

2620
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,639
anybody have a problem with teams this

2621
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,639
time

2622
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,520
it worked really well uh martin i just

2623
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,280
have a quick question you know when i

2624
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,000
was going through the strum guide myself

2625
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,760
for

2626
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,880
the strongest exam and you know just

2627
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,199
understanding

2628
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:05,920
and even on scrum.org you know i could

2629
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:07,600
see many debates on the questions that

2630
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,000
are there in the scrum guide

2631
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,440
and um so even if you look up on

2632
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,760
different websites you know you'll

2633
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:16,480
observe different viewpoints

2634
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:18,880
so that often confused me as to you know

2635
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,159
what exactly to follow and then because

2636
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,239
like you said in the very beginning that

2637
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:23,760
people may have their own interpretation

2638
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,800
because it's applied

2639
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,239
okay

2640
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,440
but then how do you choose what's

2641
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,520
correct

2642
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,360
so and there are there are there's

2643
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,840
there's there's two useful techniques

2644
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:35,440
for that right and and i i have had

2645
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,280
feedback from students that i've given

2646
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,199
this advice to and they're like yeah

2647
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,760
that really helped okay

2648
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:44,480
so what one one is always reading the

2649
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,480
scrum guide again and trying to when

2650
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:48,560
you're answering the questions

2651
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,719
don't think about how you implement

2652
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,560
scrum at your organization think about

2653
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,400
what it says in the scrum guide

2654
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,679
right that's that's one

2655
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,719
but also

2656
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:00,400
have the scrum values

2657
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:01,600
written down on a bit of paper next to

2658
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,840
your computer

2659
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,520
when you're taking the

2660
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:08,080
assessment anytime you're confused about

2661
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,080
a question

2662
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:14,239
look at the scrum values

2663
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,239
which of these answers

2664
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:19,280
enhance the scrum values and which

2665
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,280
reduce them there will never be a

2666
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,520
correct answer for a scrum.org

2667
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:26,159
assessment question that reduces the

2668
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,159
scrum values

2669
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,719
but there are still debates around it

2670
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,719
right because

2671
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,880
there there are there are still some

2672
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:38,320
debates around the ideas

2673
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:40,400
um and what what we had it so

2674
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:42,480
we do a lot of uh face-to-faces with the

2675
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:45,199
trainers at scrum.org where we get

2676
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:47,520
together and we have little events

2677
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:49,440
uh my good friend steve porter

2678
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:51,360
always runs a little event i can't

2679
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:54,080
remember what he calls it it's like

2680
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:57,280
contentious questions maybe um and they

2681
01:48:54,080 --> 01:49:00,159
bring up they have uh uh they know

2682
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,840
who gets what questions wrong right so

2683
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:04,080
they're looking at this particular

2684
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,600
question lots of people get it wrong

2685
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:08,480
let's put it in front of the traitor

2686
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,440
like a multicultural group of trainers

2687
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,840
and say

2688
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:14,480
is this actually a good question is it

2689
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:17,119
just hard to interpret

2690
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,239
or is it actually true you know testing

2691
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,840
something and lots of people get it

2692
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,480
wrong because they don't understand it

2693
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,520
so we have those debates for the for the

2694
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,679
questions

2695
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,520
internally and there's quite a few that

2696
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:29,360
it's just yeah that's

2697
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,239
just going to be a hard question right

2698
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:33,360
because

2699
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:35,199
it it it tests something fundamental

2700
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,119
like like we talked about a little bit

2701
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,320
with the the

2702
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,920
um

2703
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:41,760
uh what were the what were the things

2704
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,719
that um

2705
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:46,480
like how much refinement should you do

2706
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,320
right i mean that's scrum's not gonna

2707
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:50,719
answer that question for you

2708
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:54,320
how much do you need to do

2709
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:57,520
to mitigate the risk of being too late

2710
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:59,199
to answer a question so how much is that

2711
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,800
depends on your company depends on the

2712
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:02,000
project within that company depends on

2713
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,639
the people in your team and depends on

2714
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,639
your product owner

2715
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,719
so is it possible to say that some

2716
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:11,040
things may be politically correct but

2717
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:14,960
they may not be practically possible oh

2718
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,960
that yeah that it that is uh uh uh

2719
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,960
so

2720
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:23,040
i

2721
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:26,239
i don't think that there is anything

2722
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,040
that it says in the scrum guide

2723
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:29,599
that

2724
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,400
every company couldn't do

2725
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,639
right

2726
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:35,199
but there might be things that they

2727
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:37,119
choose not to do

2728
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:40,400
for whatever

2729
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:41,679
reasons they think are valid

2730
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,960
okay

2731
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:45,040
so

2732
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,360
we

2733
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,639
so you've got the the pragmatic side of

2734
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,000
me

2735
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:52,480
is saying

2736
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,920
you've got organizational constraints

2737
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,960
you might not be able to change those

2738
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,760
organizational constraints do as much

2739
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,119
agility as much scrum as you can within

2740
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,040
the bounds of those organizational

2741
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:06,400
constraints right

2742
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:09,199
but then the the the

2743
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:11,760
the thinker in me is saying well are all

2744
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:15,440
of those constraints actually actually

2745
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:18,480
valid do they actually have good reasons

2746
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,920
or can we poke at them a little bit i i

2747
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,760
like to think of it like do you have

2748
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,360
kids

2749
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,199
do you have kids no like once you get

2750
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,639
kids you'll know kids kids do this all

2751
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:28,159
the time you maybe remember doing this

2752
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:30,400
with your parents right

2753
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:32,719
but how do we know where our boundaries

2754
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:34,480
are as kids

2755
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:38,960
we poke at stuff

2756
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:40,480
right we poke at it we get we get a um

2757
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,000
a punishment

2758
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,440
we don't do it again maybe when we get a

2759
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,520
little older we poke at it again could

2760
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,199
we poke at it now right can we watch

2761
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,360
that movie you wouldn't let us watch

2762
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,639
three years ago okay now i can now i can

2763
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,560
do that

2764
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:54,080
so in your organization

2765
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,360
be the kid

2766
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:57,119
right you're you've always got to be

2767
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:00,239
pushing at the boundaries inside of your

2768
01:51:57,119 --> 01:52:01,840
organization which which are limiting

2769
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,119
your ability to do stuff some of them

2770
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,320
are there for good reasons and some of

2771
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,119
them aren't

2772
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,119
right

2773
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,800
uh and some of them are there for a good

2774
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:10,320
reason that's a good reason for this

2775
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,920
other team over here that do a different

2776
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,360
product but it doesn't make sense for

2777
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,960
our product

2778
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:17,520
right how do we encourage the

2779
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,360
organization to understand the gestalt

2780
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,840
of the organization to understand that

2781
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,760
there are differences and that that idea

2782
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,280
the agile mindset where what's right for

2783
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,400
one team might not be right for another

2784
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,400
team

2785
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:30,960
right because there's that idea of best

2786
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,400
practices which don't exist anymore

2787
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,840
right it's fine when we're all factory

2788
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,440
workers we could have best practices

2789
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,440
here's the one right way to do this that

2790
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:39,280
works great

2791
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,320
but we don't have that anymore

2792
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,920
so

2793
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,360
i i kind of agreed with you and

2794
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,520
disagreed with you at the same time i

2795
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,440
hope you noticed that

2796
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:51,679
yeah i believe that

2797
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:51,679
thank you make sense you're very welcome

2798
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,800
so any other questions

2799
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,520
are some new ideas to try at google mate

2800
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,000
or zoom

2801
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,840
i would happily try google meet but i

2802
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,360
wouldn't happily try zoom

2804
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:14,800
a problem with zoom i'm quite happy to

2805
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,800
