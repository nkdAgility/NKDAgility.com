1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,560
one of the really interesting um

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,599
articles that I've seen in the last few

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,200
years has been from a little

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,559
organization that you might have heard

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,000
of called the US Department of

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,680
Defense um they released an article

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,960
called the dib guide to detecting agil

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,439
BS um this was sent out to all of their

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,960
procurement officers uh worldwide so

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,800
that they could tell what whether the

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
vendors that they were hiring because

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,960
they're the procurement officers right

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,079
um were actually agile or were just

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,840
making it up right because one of the

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,760
problems that they ran into was right at

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,360
the start um they realized that when

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
they switched over to Agile procurement

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,440
terms so H back in

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,280
2013 um the US Department of Defense

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,440
updated their main procurement terms to

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,280
require iterative and incremental

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,720
delivery of any any product or system um

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,960
when they move to that model their

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
vendors just all immediately declared

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,040
themselves to be agile right the next

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,840
day oh yeah we're agile we do it in an

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,640
agile way um but most of them were

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
lying and something that I found working

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,119
with

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,479
organizations and I'm going to use the

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,600
word that's quite dramatic right um most

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,000
organizations that say they're doing

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,479
agile are also

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,159
lying right I've being dramatic but uh

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,600
they kind of are so um the detecting

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,240
agile uh BS article came up with a whole

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,119
bunch of questions it's totally worth

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,320
going reading it uh but there are six

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,719
main questions which I think are the

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,240
most important pieces of the story this

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,000
was the questions to leadership within

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,920
the

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,439
organization so I'd like you to think

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,640
about these

45
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,760
questions from your perspective within

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,239
your organization if you asked your

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,160
leadership if this is true across the

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,040
board in your organization um is it is

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,480
it true so there get six questions so

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:29,360
the first one is are teams delivering

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,239
working software to at least some subset

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,840
of users every iteration including the

53
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,400
first and Gathering

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,000
feedback think about that every single

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,879
iteration you should be delivering

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,319
working product to real

57
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:54,519
users not uat not a test environment

58
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,360
real production users every iteration

59
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,519
including the first now that's really

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,959
hard lots of teams struggle

61
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,560
with creating working product with

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,519
getting that working product out the

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,040
door and even more like Gathering

64
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,760
feedback it's that's almost as rare as

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:20,000
delivering working product so what what

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,720
this is effectively saying is that if

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,440
you as a as a team or you're part of the

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,159
organization is unable to deliver

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,959
working software to production on a

70
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:38,439
regular Cadence you're probably not

71
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,439
being very agile right um and ideally uh

72
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,799
you want to be delivering on a on a very

73
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:47,360
regular Cadence so the agile Manifesto

74
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,480
would talk about um from a couple of

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,000
weeks from a few weeks to a couple of

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,879
months I think is the phrasing it uses

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,519
with a preference to the shorter time

78
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:01,120
scale so you probably shouldn't go two

79
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,480
months without um shipping to production

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,640
and then for the scrum guide it talks

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,280
about no more than every 30 days so it

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,200
puts a hard one month uh uh uh figure on

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,919
that 30 days and yeah that that can be

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,479
difficult for organizations there's lots

85
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,280
of organizations out there that have

86
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,400
made this change um no organization that

87
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,000
has made this change to

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,080
Wars continuous delivery to production

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
has gone back and decided not to do it

90
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,039
anymore right once you get there the

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,880
level of quality that you need in your

92
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,759
product the engagement you get with your

93
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,880
customers these are all things that are

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,320
are much much much higher once you get

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,240
there and nobody wants to go back uh but

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,160
getting there is difficult takes time

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,120
investment in in skills for your

98
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,520
engineering teams in skills for

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
leadership in changes to your business

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,199
practices um to make that in any way in

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,639
any way viable but is absolutely worth

102
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:08,440
it and even the US Department of Defense

103
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,759
uh requires that their vendors are able

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,479
to deliver working software to real

105
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,360
users every iteration including the

106
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,720
first if your answer to any one of these

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,759
questions or the answer of your business

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,319
to any one of these questions is no

109
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,479
we're not doing that then you would

110
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,720
probably I probably wouldn't consider

111
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,639
that you're already in the agile space

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,639
right you're not already agile you might

113
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,919
be working towards it and you might have

114
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,960
put in loads of effort but unless you

115
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:50,479
can Mark every single one of these six

116
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,680
questions as yes we do this this is how

117
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,840
things work here then we're still

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,080
lacking we're still trying we're still

119
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:05,080
working towards being agile now this is

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,319
just a litmus test dreamed up uh by uh

121
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,880
the US Department of Defense but they

122
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,599
are probably the least likely place for

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,520
you to expect something um with this

124
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,800
High a bar to have come from and I'm not

125
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,280
going to um go into a team uh and work

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,440
with a team or a company and if they're

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
not doing these things then I'm going to

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,759
say well you guys suck you're not agile

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
because you're not doing this that's

130
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,720
that's not how we work towards

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,919
success uh but I think it's hugely

132
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,800
valuable from the perspective of

133
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,440
self-reflection for you all to think

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,639
about the processes and practices in

135
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,880
your organization and are you a how many

136
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,919
of these six questions are you able to

137
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,319
achieve and what could you do to make it

138
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,160
a little bit easier for the teams for

139
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,400
the people doing the work to work

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:07,280
towards this

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,280
idea of not being agile BS
