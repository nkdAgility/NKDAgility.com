It discusses agile principles at a high level but never references or describes 'Definition of Workflow' or its core concepts such as explicit agreements, workflow policies, WIP limits, entry/exit criteria, or Kanban. Any workflow-related points are generic (e.g., 'simplifying processes', 'adapting quickly'), not tied to making workflow explicit. There are no distinctions made between Kanban and Scrum, or specific ties to the Kanban Guide or key sources. The focus is not on making work visible through explicit policies, but on iterations, experimentation, and collaboration in general. Thus, there is minimal conceptual alignment, depth, or direct mention, and the content does not substantially match the category criteria.",

The collaboration described is strictly among humans and does not reference AI as a teammate, advisor, or partner, which is central to this category.
