Russell is one of the best PSPO trainers. He has long experience building something other than software. He used to design control surfaces for military aircraft. In the past, he really understands that connection between product and how we need to work in order to maximise the value of the work that we do. That's absolutely crucial to that product owner class. I've caught up with Russell. I've been in classes with him. I've participated as a student in his classes, and he's one of the best trainers in the world.
