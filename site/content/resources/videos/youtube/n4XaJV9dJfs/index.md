In my journey through the world of Agile and Scrum, one of the most enlightening experiences has been teaching the Agile Product Strategy (APS) class to beginner Scrum teams. The most valuable takeaway for these teams is undoubtedly the grounding in understanding complexity and empiricism. Today, I want to share my insights on why these concepts are crucial and how they can transform your approach to Scrum.

### Understanding Complexity

Complexity is a fascinating topic, especially when we consider how it impacts our planning and execution. As we delve deeper into complex environments, we often find ourselves on an exponential scale of unpredictability. Here’s how I see it:

- **Low Complexity**: In scenarios where complexity is minimal—think of a textile mill with a thousand machines producing fabric—we can plan with a high degree of accuracy. We understand the cadence of the machines, the time it takes to retool for different fabrics, and the overall workflow. Variance is low, and while surprises like machine breakdowns or injuries can occur, they are relatively infrequent.

- **High Complexity**: As we transition into high variance work, the landscape changes dramatically. This is where the APS class shines, focusing on quantifying what high variance work looks like and how it feels for those involved. 

To illustrate this, we often engage in experiential exercises. Depending on the class, we might build websites or even use Minecraft—my personal favourite! This hands-on approach allows participants to truly feel the difference between complicated and complex systems. Once they grasp this distinction, we can pivot to discussing risk mitigation in complex environments.

### The Importance of Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation

In the realm of complexity, the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation become paramount. Here’s why:

- **Transparency**: We emphasise the need for clear visibility into our work. The definition of done, the product backlog, and the Sprint backlog must all be transparent. Without this clarity, the value of our Scrum events diminishes significantly.

- **Inspection**: There’s little point in conducting a Sprint review if we don’t have a transparent product to evaluate. Similarly, Sprint planning becomes ineffective without a clear product backlog. These artifacts are the foundation upon which everything else is built.

- **Adaptation**: The ability to adapt based on what we learn during inspections is crucial. It’s this cycle of transparency, inspection, and adaptation that enables teams to navigate the complexities of their work effectively.

### Conclusion

As I reflect on my experiences teaching the APS class, I am continually reminded of the profound impact that understanding complexity can have on a Scrum team’s effectiveness. By embracing these principles, teams can not only improve their processes but also foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
