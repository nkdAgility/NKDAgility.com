While there is discussion of workflows in a general sense (e.g., using a textile mill as an example), these references are not specific to the Definition of Workflow in the Kanban context. Instead, the content emphasizes Scrum artifacts like product backlog and definition of done, and while transparency of work is discussed, it does not elaborate on explicit workflow agreements, WIP limits, entry/exit criteria, or Kanban-specific workflow policies. There are no direct or substantial references to the Definition of Workflow or its distinguishing Kanban features, and the overall purpose is to support Scrum practitioners in understanding complexity and the value of transparency, not to define or explore workflow in the Kanban/agile theoretical framework.",

However, it never directly mentions 'Product Developer' (role/accountability) or delves into the unique attributes, responsibilities, or collective accountabilities central to modern Product Developer framing. The discussion is largely about Agile teams broadly, not formal accountabilities, so alignment and depth are middling. The intended audience overlaps with practitioners, and most content is relevant, but the connection to Product Developer as a distinct role is indirect and primarily implied through references to Scrum teams. No penalties were warranted as content is current and neutral in tone.",

No direct reference to human-AI teams, distributed cognition involving AI, or collective intelligence in the classification sense.

Agency is implied (in adaptation and improvement), but philosophical/principled discussion on agency or its engineered maximization is not present. The content targets Agile practitioners, matching the category’s probable audience, but is ultimately more about general Agile/Scrum practice than agentic engineering perspectives.",
