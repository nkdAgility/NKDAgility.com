However, it primarily focuses on describing concepts rather than outlining specific, actionable tenets. There is a modest depth of discussion in how these principles impact Scrum practices, which lends some alignment but does not fully embrace the prescriptive nature of tenets in guiding decision-making within an organization.",

    "reasoning": "The content does not directly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE) at all, nor does it touch on any of the key aspects outlined under the SLE category. There is extensive discussion about complexity, transparency, inspection, adaptation, and general Agile/Scrum principles, but nowhere does it reference forecasting cycle times, probability-based service forecasts, or other SLE-specific concepts. While the discussion is aimed at Scrum practitioners and continuous improvementâ€”an indirect connection to the intended audience and purpose of SLEâ€”the core themes are unrelated. There is no exploration of SLE calculation, communication of SLE, or its use in Kanban/Scrum metrics. Thus, all dimensions are scored very low, and the final confidence score (7.5) appropriately reflects that this content is almost entirely irrelevant to the SLE category according to the strict classification guidance.",
