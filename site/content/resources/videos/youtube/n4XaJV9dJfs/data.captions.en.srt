1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
so the most useful element of the aps

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,480
class for beginner scrum teams is really

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:12,400
that grounding in understanding

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,679
complexity and empiricism right um so

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,440
that's something that we really focus on

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,160
and double down those two those two

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,720
things so the first one is is complexity

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,080
right

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,080
you there is a

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
difference as you as you increase in

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,040
complexity and usually it's an

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,719
exponential scale right right the type

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,800
the type of processes and practices that

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:42,160
you use need to change as you increase

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,520
in complexity so if we have very low

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,079
complexity um let's say it's just

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
complicated or even it's simple then we

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,359
can probably plan further out into the

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,800
future and and and be okay right we can

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,079
plan let's say we're running a a a

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,719
textile mill and we have a thousand

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:07,720
machines producing fabric um in general

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,040
you'll be able to predict how long to a

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,960
very high degree of accuracy it will

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,600
take to fulfill whatever order comes in

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,439
right because you understand the Cadence

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
of the machines you understand how long

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,400
it takes to retool the machines for

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,000
different types of fabrics or different

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,000
patterns you you already understand all

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,079
of that stuff up front and it's fairly

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,479
consistent there's the odd thing a

33
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,960
machine breaks down something else goes

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,600
wrong somebody gets injured right these

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,680
are all things that can surprise you or

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,439
get in the way but generally the

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,799
variance is very small as soon as you

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,560
get into really high variance work the

39
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,119
aps really focuses on that piece that

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,799
high variance work and quantifies what

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
does it look like and how does it feel

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,680
right how does it feel for the people

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,000
involved um so we do that through an

44
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,880
exercise that enables people to

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,759
experience complexity depending on which

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,759
class you go to will depend on what

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,520
experience that is uh we've done um

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,599
building websites uh we've done uh

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,319
Minecraft right that's my favorite one

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,239
is is using Minecraft in that class um

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
to to create that complexity so that

52
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,760
people actually feel it once they

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
realize the difference between

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,160
complicated and complex they feel it

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,959
then we can start talking about well how

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,400
do we how do we mitigate risk in that

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,200
world of um of complexity and that's

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,840
where we focus very heavily on

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
transparency inspection and adaption

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,680
right that's why we talk about

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
definition of done really heavily we

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
talk about the product backlog and why

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,159
it needs to be transparent um we talk

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,440
about the the Sprint backlog and why it

65
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,400
needs to be transparent all of those

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,400
things are the important piece cuz

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,120
everything else is built on top of it

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,959
there's no point in doing a Sprint

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,879
review unless you have a transparent

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,280
product to look at there's no point in

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,159
doing a Sprint planning unless you have

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,720
a transparent product backlog to look at

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,360
you need those um artifacts those three

74
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,879
artifacts in scrum with their

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,599
commitments in order to be able to do

76
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,040
everything else and that's what makes it
