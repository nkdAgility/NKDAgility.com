# Why is product backlog management getting so much attention right now

The #agilemanifesto was a strong signal from the #softwarengineer community that traditional #projectmanagement wasn't well suited to complex environments, and a new style of working and thinking was needed to thrive in these environments.

As such, #agile gained a lot of traction in the market and more organizations adopted #scrum or an #agileframework to help them navigate uncertainty and complexity. For many, that just meant that today we did this and tomorrow we're doing #scrum without any formal training, coaching, or professional guidance.

As such, many teams haven't mastered the basics and @ScrumOrg have created a new Professional Scrum Product Backlog Management course to help people master this element of scrum. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why Product Backlog Management is receiving a great deal of attention right now.
