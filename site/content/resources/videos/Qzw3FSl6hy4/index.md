# What is product discovery and how does it differ from how we've always developed products?

### 🎯 **Video Summary: What is Product Discovery and Why It’s Crucial?**

---

#### **📘 Introduction: Understanding Product Discovery**

- **What is Product Discovery?**
  - Product discovery is the critical work done to plan for the future of a product.
  - It’s about more than just executing tasks; it’s about uncovering what needs to be built, understanding the market, and anticipating user needs.

---

#### **🔍 **Key Concepts in Product Discovery**

1. **🔄 Continuous Exploration**:
   - Product discovery isn’t a one-time task; it’s an ongoing process of exploring and identifying both the known and unknown elements that could improve the product.
   - It includes everything from research and design to collaboration with other teams to ensure a holistic understanding of what’s needed.

2. **🧠 Expanding Beyond the Obvious**:
   - Discovery isn’t just about what you know you need; it’s also about uncovering needs and opportunities you didn’t realize were there.
   - This proactive approach can lead to better user experiences, new market opportunities, and increased user base.

3. **📊 Strategic Direction & Alignment**:
   - At scale, discovery involves setting strategic directions and aligning various teams and departments to work towards common goals.
   - For example, large organizations like Microsoft engage in discovery to coordinate across numerous teams, ensuring everyone is moving towards the same objectives.

4. **🔍 Refinement vs. Discovery**:
   - While Scrum calls part of this process "refinement," discovery is broader, encompassing everything from the initial idea to the final product.
   - It’s not just about fine-tuning; it’s about exploring new possibilities and ensuring that every decision aligns with the overall vision.

#### **🚀 **Real-World Examples of Product Discovery**

1. **Azure DevOps Example**:
   - With over 90 teams working on a single product, Azure DevOps illustrates the scale and complexity of product discovery.
   - Strategic direction is set at a high level, and discovery is essential at every stage to ensure that all teams are aligned and contributing to the overall goal.

2. **Microsoft’s Creators Update**:
   - Microsoft’s focus on the "Creators Update" is an example of how discovery leads to tangible outcomes.
   - By targeting creators (writers, artists, musicians), Microsoft enhanced its products to better serve this market, which involved coordinated efforts across multiple teams.

#### **🎯 **The Importance of Product Discovery**

- **Why It Matters**:
  - Without a strong discovery process, even the best engineering teams can fail to deliver real value.
  - Discovery ensures that the team’s efforts are focused on the right problems, leading to better outcomes for the business.

- **Aligning Teams & Goals**:
  - Discovery aligns everyone from the lowest-level team members to the highest-level executives, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the organization’s strategic goals.

#### **🌟 **Conclusion: The Power of Deliberate Discovery**

- **Product Discovery is Underserved**:
  - Despite its importance, many organizations don’t give enough attention to deliberate discovery.
  - Shifting focus towards this can unlock new market opportunities and enhance the value delivered to customers.

- **The Future of Product Development**:
  - Teams that excel at discovery are not just executing; they’re innovating, creating, and driving the business forward.
