While it does mention principles such as feedback gathering, stakeholder involvement, and adapting the Product Backlog based on new insights, it lacks a clear discussion of broader principles like Empiricism, Continuous Improvement, or Respect for People. The primary emphasis is on the procedural aspects of the Sprint Review rather than on the underlying principles that guide decision-making and team behavior, which limits its alignment with the category 'Principle'. Therefore, it receives a moderately high confidence score for relevance but not a high score due to lacking deeper principle discussions.",
