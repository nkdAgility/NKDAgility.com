In this month's episode of Agile Actually, we picked up some whispers on the [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) winds about [#productmanagement](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanagement) being obsolete. The idea that if you have a strong [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) in [#scrum](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/scrum), there is no need for a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) at all.

To explore this concept, we invited Ralph Jocham - a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) and [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) expert - to talk about the differences between product ownership and product management and whether these whispers held any truth.
