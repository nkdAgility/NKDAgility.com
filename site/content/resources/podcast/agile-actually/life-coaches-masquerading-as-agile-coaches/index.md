title: Life coaches masquerading as Agile Coaches
short_title: Life Coaches Posing as Agile Coaches
description: Examines the rise of life coaches claiming to be Agile Coaches, the controversy around their qualifications, and the impact on organisations seeking genuine Agile expertise.
tldr: The podcast discusses concerns about life coaches presenting themselves as Agile Coaches without the necessary Agile experience or credentials, which can mislead organizations. True Agile Coaches typically have extensive hands-on Agile practice and formal training. Development managers should verify the background and expertise of Agile Coaches before engaging them to ensure effective support for their teams.

In this month's edition of [#agileactually](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileactually), Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) for a life coach to present themselves as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) to organizations.

In most cases, an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) or [#agilecosultant](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecosultant) will have years of experience as an [#agilepractitioner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilepractitioner), actively working in an [#agileteam](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteam), followed by certification and practise as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) leading multiple [#agileteams](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteams) in multiple applications.

That's why it's controversial that someone with very little [#professionalcoaching](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/professionalcoaching) skills and [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach).

Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly?

Find out in this month's Agile Actually Podcast.
