In this month's edition of [#agileactually](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileactually), Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) for a life coach to present themselves as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) to organizations.

In most cases, an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) or [#agilecosultant](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecosultant) will have years of experience as an [#agilepractitioner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilepractitioner), actively working in an [#agileteam](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteam), followed by certification and practise as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) leading multiple [#agileteams](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteams) in multiple applications.

That's why it's controversial that someone with very little [#professionalcoaching](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/professionalcoaching) skills and [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach).

Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly?

Find out in this month's Agile Actually Podcast.
