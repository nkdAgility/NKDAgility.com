    "reasoning": "The content centers on the importance of precise language, transparency, and communication practices in the context of Agile, but provides no explicit statements on customer outcomes, value measurement, or delivery alignment to customer needs. While the hosts are experienced in agile, consulting, and product delivery, the specific podcast episode does not mention feedback loops, customer validation, or evidence-based prioritization. The intended audience is largely aligned with agile and product practitioners, but all explicit references relate to internal team behaviors and communication, not what defines or delivers customer value. Therefore, there is minimal conceptual overlap with Customer Focus, and the discussion remains mostly on the meta-level of language rather than concrete customer-driven product delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This podcast episode focuses on Agile communication and language precision rather than on customer outcomes or value delivery. While relevant to Agile practitioners, it doesn't address how customer focus drives product development, so alignment with the Customer Focus category is weak.",

There is no explicit anchor to first-principle thinking, no differentiation between first principles and derived values, and no discussion of the consequences of violating such principles. The content targets Agile professionals (positive for audience), but the majority of substance is outside scope.",
