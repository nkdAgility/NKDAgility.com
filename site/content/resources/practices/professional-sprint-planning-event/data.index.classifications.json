    "reasoning": "The content is a detailed discussion of the Sprint Planning event in Scrum. Nowhere does it directly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it describe or discuss SLE's components (elapsed time range with probability), its calculation from cycle time data, or its use as a forecast within Kanban, Scrum, or Agile. The text frequently mentions forecasting the Sprint work, capacity, and planning, but these are general Scrum practices and do not refer to SLE. While there is some faint conceptual alignment (forecasting, transparency, predictability, team/stakeholder expectations), it does not touch on SLE by definition or practice. The main audience is agile practitioners, which is a slight match, but the focus is tangential. Virtually all content is about Sprint Planning, not SLE or its theory from authoritative sources like the Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams or Daniel Vacanti. There is no outdated, satirical, or critical content, so no penalties apply. The low scores across all dimensions result in a low confidence, consistent with the content almost never referring to or aligning with Service Level Expectation.",
