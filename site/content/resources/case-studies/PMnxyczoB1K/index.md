## Client Context

SLB (formerly Schlumberger), a global energy technology company, had over 90 engineering teams in 13 locations across 9 countries contributing to a single product: Petrel. Each team operated independently, choosing its own source control system, build environment, and branching strategy. Some used Git, others Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC), SVN, or even in-house tools.

The result? A sprawling mess of incompatibilities, blind spots, and inefficiencies.

## The Ask: Build System Simplification and Consolidation

Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility was asked to assess the situation and recommend a path forward. The goal: consolidate build and source control processes to enable faster, more reliable, and more autonomous development.

### Diagnosis: Extreme Fragmentation and Build Fragility

Martin’s assessment uncovered:

- **An overloaded central build team**: Eight engineers were running 11,000 builds a day, producing 27 petabytes of data annually just to generate one working version of the product per month.
- **Inconsistent tooling and branching**: Each team used their own tools and created custom branches, making traceability and integration nearly impossible.
- **Lack of ownership and accountability**: The build process was treated as someone else's problem. Teams weren’t accountable for build quality or integration readiness.

### Approach: Advisory Engagement Rooted in Engineering Principles

Martin didn’t implement the solution directly. Instead, he provided:

- **A clear architectural recommendation**: Migrate to a single source control system (initially TFVC, later Git) and adopt a consistent branching model across all teams.
- **Branching strategy and build design consulting**: Martin guided SLB on how to design a scalable branching structure that balanced autonomy and alignment.
- **Education on engineering accountability**: He helped reposition build and release as shared engineering responsibilities, not something delegated to a separate team.
- **Ongoing consultation throughout implementation**: While SLB owned the execution, Martin provided iterative guidance and validation.

### Outcomes: Ownership, Speed, and Significant Cost Reduction

- **Shifted ownership of build and release to engineering teams**: 90+ teams began managing their own builds and branches, removing bottlenecks.
- **Reduced central build team from 8 to 2 people**: A leaner core team focused on platform support, not firefighting.
- **Improved developer autonomy and morale**: Teams had the tools and responsibility to manage their own work, increasing throughput and engagement.
- **Simplified engineering processes**: With one source control system and a standard branching model, release management became predictable and transparent.

## Strategic Reflection: Engineering Excellence Through Real Ownership

This case represents a core NKD Agility principle:

> Real engineering excellence isn’t about tighter control—it’s about giving teams the *right structure* so they can take responsibility for quality, speed, and stability.

Martin’s advice helped SLB do just that: reframe build and release as team-owned practices rather than operational burdens.

### Why It Matters for CTOs and Tech Leaders

- **Technical Leadership**: Empowering engineers to own build and release is a foundational move toward scalable, resilient development.
- **Engineering Excellence**: This engagement demonstrates how structural advice—not new tooling alone—can unlock better results across distributed teams.
- **Strategic Impact**: Simplification enabled better forecasting, reduced overhead, and made SLB’s engineering system more future-ready.

## Final Takeaway

When engineers own the system they work in, magic happens. NKD Agility helps organizations create the clarity, structure, and culture where that ownership can thrive.
