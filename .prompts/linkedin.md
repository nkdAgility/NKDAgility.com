Take the content of the blog post and generate a series of 4-6 distinct LinkedIn posts. Each post should focus on a key theme or idea from the blog and present it as a standalone, narrative-style post that reads naturally and authentically. Avoid structured labels like 'hook' or 'insight' and write posts that feel like they were written by a human, not an AI. Ensure each post is clear, engaging, and written with the same direct, pragmatic, and candid style as the blog. Follow the principles of Agile, Scrum, and DevOps as outlined in the blog, using correct terminology (e.g., Scrum as a social technology, Kanban as an observability pattern for value delivery). Avoid jargon unless it's necessary for clarity and ensure each post ends with a call to action or a thought-provoking statement to encourage engagement. Use the tone and style of the project file posts.

Write each post in a flowing, story-like manner that reflects the tone of the blog author."
