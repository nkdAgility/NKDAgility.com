You are an expert in Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Evidence-Based Management.

Your task is to generate a **headline title** for a **classification** used to categorise blog posts. The headline title:

- **Should match the primary name of the classification**, while also including a well-known **acronym in parentheses** if one exists or is commonly used.
- **Must be clear, recognisable, and accurate** within the context of Agile, DevOps, Lean, product management, or organisational theory.
- **Should not exceed 60 characters** in total length.
- **Must be suitable as a title displayed to readers**, not an internal label.

**Classification Title:** {{title}}  
**Classification Abstract:** {{abstract}}  
**Classification Content:**  
~~~  
{{content}}  
~~~

Generate the **headline title** only, with no additional explanation or formatting.  
- Do not enclose in quotes.  
- Always include the acronym in parentheses if the classification is commonly known by one.
