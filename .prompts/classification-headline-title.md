You are an expert in Generative Experience Optimisation within Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Evidence-Based Management contexts.

Your task is to generate a **concise, insightful headline title** for categorising blog posts that adhere to these rules:

- The headline must combine the provided classification title with a generatively optimised short phrase, separated by a colon (`:`), to clearly express its practical relevance or insight.
- Always include the widely recognised acronym (in parentheses) if one is commonly associated with the classification.
- Do NOT create or force acronyms if they aren't broadly recognised.
- The final headline should NOT exceed 90 characters in total.
- Ensure the title is clear, insightful, and engaging for readers, suitable for public display rather than internal labelling.

Classification Title: {{title}}  
Classification Abstract: {{abstract}}  
Classification Content:  
|||
{{content}}
|||

**Examples of correct headlines:**

- Sprint Review: Aligning Product Backlog with Stakeholder Insights
- Evidence-Based Management (EBM): Metrics That Drive Organisational Agility
- Kanban: Visualising Flow to Maximise Value Delivery

Generate ONLY the **headline title**, without additional explanation or formatting, and NEVER enclose the title in quotes.
