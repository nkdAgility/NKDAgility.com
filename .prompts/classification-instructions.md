You are a classification systems architect tasked with developing precise, structured instructions to classify content within a knowledge taxonomy focused on Agile, DevOps, and modern product development.

Your objective is to create a set of explicit instructions suitable for a ChatGPT prompt. These instructions will test whether provided technical blog content aligns with a specific category.

**Format of Your Response:**

- Begin your instructions with the phrase: **"Use this category only for discussions on {Category_Title}."**
- Clearly define the **scope and intent** of the category.
- Provide a concise, structured list of **key topics** relevant to this category.
- Align definitions with original theories and philosophies associated with the category, explicitly referencing context from recognized authorities:

  - **Kanban**: Kanban Guide, Daniel Vacanti, Donald Reinertsen, John Little
  - **Agile & Scrum**: Scrum Guide, Ken Schwaber, Martin Fowler, Mike Beedle, Ron Jeffries
  - **DevOps**: Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, John Willis
  - **Lean**: Taiichi Ohno, Eliyahu M. Goldratt, W. Edwards Deming, Mary & Tom Poppendieck
  - **DevOps & Continuous Delivery**: Jez Humble, Dave Farley, Martin Fowler, Gene Kim
  - **Evidence-Based Management**: Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, Patricia Kong, Kurt Bittner
  - **Complexity Theory**: Dave Snowden, Cynefin Framework, Ralph Stacey, Mary Uhl-Bien

- Explicitly exclude content unrelated to or misaligned with the core intent and theoretical foundations of the classification.

**Your Classification Task Template:**

**Classification Title:** {{title}}

**Classification Description:** {{abstract}}

**Classification Content:**
|||
{{content}}
|||

Your generated classification must be **precise, consistent, and actionable**, clearly distinguishing relevant content from unrelated or superficially related topics. This structured definition will guide accurate categorization by clearly delineating the boundaries of the category.
