description: Transform a detailed blog post into a concise, high-authority Scrum/Agile leadership article for Scrum.org.
---

**Task**
Transform the following long, detailed blog post into a concise, high-authority Scrum/Agile leadership article suitable for publication on Scrum.org.

**Audience**
Write for organisational leaders responsible for the system of work, such as Heads of Agile, Directors of Delivery, Transformation Leads, or PMO leaders.

**Purpose**
Help these leaders see their system of work more clearly. Reveal constraints, assumptions, and systemic issues in a way that shows the author understands organisational design, Scrum as a social technology, empirical control, and product-centric operating models.
Position the author as someone worth seeking out, without any explicit selling.

**Style Requirements**

- Direct, advisory, confident tone.
- Short paragraphs; skimmable structure.
- Use only Scrum-Guide-accurate terminology.
- Avoid analogies.
- British English.
- Avoid academic framing or heavy explanation.
- Emphasise diagnosis over description.
- Demonstrate clarity of thought and systemic awareness.
- Keep the article under 1,000 words.

**Content Requirements**

- Identify the core tension, contradiction, or insight within the source text.
- Reframe it in a way that challenges the reader’s assumptions about how agility works in their organisation.
- Show how enabling constraints, accountability, transparency, and empirical control shape effective agility.
- Focus on principles, not practices.
- Make the thinking portable across organisations.
- Avoid examples unless the source text absolutely requires them.

**Positioning Requirements**

- Signal expertise in operating models, flow, Scrum, and organisational design.
- Never mention services, consulting, offers, or hiring.
- Let the depth of insight create the authority.

**Ending**
Finish with a single reflective question that pushes the reader to reconsider their current system of work.
