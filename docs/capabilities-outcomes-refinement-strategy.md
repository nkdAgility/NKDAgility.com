# Capabilities & Outcomes Refinement Strategy

**Date:** 24 November 2025  
**Objective:** Apply Alan Weiss buyer-outcome lens to Capabilities ("what we do") and Outcomes ("what the customer gets") with dual-audience framing for CXOs and Development Managers, using DORA and EBM for credibility without making claims.

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides strategic guidance for refining NKD Agility's Capabilities and Outcomes pages to speak directly to:

1. **Small-company CXOs** (CTO, CEO, COO) - focusing on economic visibility, ROI clarity, strategic confidence, and reduced delivery risk
2. **Development Managers and Directors** in mid-large organisations - focusing on predictability, reduced firefighting, clear flow, and strengthened leadership credibility

The refinement applies **Alan Weiss's buyer-outcome principles**: improved condition, economic clarity, and strategic confidence—without making promises or guaranteeing results.

---

## Alan Weiss Positioning Framework

### Core Principles

**Improved Condition (Not Output)**
- Focus on the state the client achieves, not the deliverables produced
- Example: "Clear visibility into where engineering investment creates business value" vs. "Monthly engineering dashboards"

**Economic Clarity**
- Help buyers see the financial impact without claiming specific ROI
- Use industry benchmarks (DORA, EBM) to show potential, not promises
- Example: "DORA research shows elite teams deploy 208x more frequently. Even closing part of that gap means weeks or months of competitive advantage."

**Strategic Confidence**
- Reduce uncertainty in decision-making
- Enable leaders to act decisively with evidence rather than opinion
- Example: "You'll know which initiatives drive revenue within 30 days, using Evidence-Based Management metrics"

### Positioning Statements by Audience

#### For CXOs (Small Companies)

**What They Need:**
- Economic visibility: where engineering money goes and what it delivers
- ROI clarity: engineering as value driver, not cost centre
- Faster strategic decisions: reduced decision latency
- Reduced waste: eliminate rework, waiting, handoffs
- Ability to innovate: technical capability that enables new market opportunities
- Lower delivery risk: predictability without bureaucracy
- Confidence: trust in engineering investments

**Positioning Statement:**
*"We help CTOs and technical leaders gain economic clarity over engineering investments, reduce decision latency, and build delivery systems that scale without overhead—so every engineering decision creates measurable strategic advantage."*

#### For Development Managers (Mid-Large Organisations)

**What They Need:**
- Predictability: reliable delivery without heroics
- Reduced firefighting: proactive systems, not reactive chaos
- Clear flow: visibility into bottlenecks and cycle time
- Improved delivery confidence: ship without fear
- Fewer escalations: systems that work, reducing upward problems
- Evidence for senior leadership: data that builds credibility
- Support for internal platforms: recognition that their work matters (DevOps systems, developer experience, shared services)

**Positioning Statement:**
*"We work with Development Managers to build predictable delivery systems, reduce firefighting, and strengthen leadership credibility through evidence-based practices—while supporting both customer-facing products and internal platforms that enable the whole organisation."*

## DORA Metrics Integration

### Usage Guidelines

**Ethical Use:**
- Reference DORA research as industry potential, not your results
- Use metrics to show the gap between low and elite performers
- Help clients understand what's possible without claiming you'll deliver it
- British English: "organisations" not "organizations"

**Key DORA Metrics:**

1. **Deployment Frequency**: How often code reaches production
   - Elite: Multiple times per day
   - Low: Once per month to once every six months
   - Usage: "DORA research shows elite teams deploy 208x more frequently than low performers. That's not incremental improvement—that's competitive advantage."

2. **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from commit to production
   - Elite: Less than one hour
   - Low: Between one week and one month
   - Usage: "Elite engineering organisations (per DORA) move from idea to customer value in hours, not weeks. Even closing half that gap changes strategic options."

3. **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures
   - Elite: 0-15%
   - Low: 46-60%
   - Usage: "DORA shows elite performers have 7x lower change failure rates. Fewer production incidents mean lower support costs and higher customer retention."

4. **Time to Restore Service**: How quickly service is restored after incident
   - Elite: Less than one hour
   - Low: Between one week and one month
   - Usage: "Elite organisations (per DORA research) recover from incidents 2,604x faster than low performers. That's the difference between minutes of downtime and days."

**Application in Content:**
- Use DORA to show **industry potential**, not guaranteed outcomes
- Frame as "research shows" or "industry data indicates"
- Connect to buyer outcomes: faster decisions, lower risk, economic clarity
- Never say "we will achieve these metrics" - say "we help you close the gap"

---

## Evidence-Based Management (EBM) Integration

### Core EBM Concepts

**Four Key Value Areas:**

1. **Current Value (CV)**: What value the product delivers today
   - Metrics: Customer satisfaction, revenue per user, feature usage
   - For CXOs: "Are we extracting value from what we've built?"
   - For Dev Managers: "Are customers actually using what we ship?"

2. **Time-to-Market (T2M)**: Speed of value delivery
   - Metrics: Lead time, cycle time, deployment frequency, release frequency
   - For CXOs: "How fast can we respond to market opportunities?"
   - For Dev Managers: "How predictably can we deliver?"

3. **Ability to Innovate (A2I)**: Capacity to deliver new value
   - Metrics: Technical debt, deployment automation, time spent on innovation vs. rework
   - For CXOs: "Can we pursue new strategic opportunities without being constrained by legacy systems?"
   - For Dev Managers: "Is my team building new capability or fighting fires?"

4. **Unrealised Value (UV)**: Gap between current and potential value
   - Metrics: Customer needs not met, market opportunities not pursued
   - For CXOs: "What value are we leaving on the table?"
   - For Dev Managers: "What could we deliver if systems weren't in the way?"

**Application in Content:**
- Use EBM framing to connect technical work to business outcomes
- Help buyers see the economic impact of engineering improvements
- Frame challenges using EBM dimensions (e.g., "You're strong on Current Value but constrained on Ability to Innovate due to technical debt")
- Use language like "Evidence-Based Management helps you understand..." not "we implement EBM"

## Dual-Framing Pattern: CXO + Dev Manager Sections

### Template Structure

Each Capability and Outcome page should include:

**1. Universal Problem Statement**
- The pain both audiences feel (framed differently for each)

**2. Our Approach** 
- What we do (capability) or what you get (outcome)

**3. "What This Means for CXOs" Section**
- Economic framing
- Strategic impact
- Board-level credibility
- Lightweight approach for small teams

**4. "What This Means for Development Managers" Section**
- Operational framing  
- Team-level impact
- Strengthening their leadership (not threatening it)
- Support for customer-facing AND internal platforms

**5. Reassurance Pattern**
- No disruption to existing work
- Designed for scale (works in small orgs without overhead, large orgs without bureaucracy)
- Clear engagement journey

### Example Dual-Framing Section

#### For "Strategic Decision-Making" Outcome:

**What This Means for CXOs:**

You'll gain economic visibility into where engineering investments create value and where they drain resources. Using Evidence-Based Management principles, you'll connect strategic intent to delivery reality within 30 days—not quarters.

This means:
- **Faster strategic decisions**: Industry data (DORA) shows elite organisations make decisions 106x faster. We help you close that gap through clear metrics and aligned operating models.
- **Engineering ROI clarity**: You'll see which initiatives contribute to Current Value and which unlock Ability to Innovate—in language the board understands.
- **Lower decision risk**: Evidence-based approach reduces guesswork. You'll know what's working before committing significant resources.
- **Lightweight for small teams**: No enterprise overhead. Metrics and operating models designed for organisations where every hire and every decision matters.

**What This Means for Development Managers:**

You'll gain the evidence needed to align senior leadership on delivery realities and the predictability needed to stop firefighting.

This means:
- **Clear flow metrics**: Understand where your team's time goes and what creates bottlenecks—using cycle time, WIP limits, and throughput data.
- **Fewer escalations**: When delivery is predictable, problems get solved at the team level, not escalated upward.
- **Strengthened leadership credibility**: Present evidence-based progress to senior leaders, building trust rather than managing expectations through hope.
- **Recognition for platform work**: We support both customer-facing products AND internal platforms—DevOps systems, developer experience, and shared services that enable the whole organisation.
- **No disruption**: We work within your existing systems and ceremonies, strengthening what works rather than replacing it.

---

## Reassurance Patterns

### "No Disruption" Reassurance

**Pattern:**
"We work within your existing systems and ways of working. You don't stop delivering to transform—you transform by improving how you deliver."

**Application:**
- Embedded in engagement model descriptions
- Reinforced in "What This Means" sections
- Connected to timeboxed retainer model (no fixed scope, adapt continuously)

**Example:**
"Our embedded consulting model means we work alongside your teams during active delivery. No workshops in conference rooms while the backlog grows—real improvement in real work."

### "Designed for Scale" Reassurance

**Pattern:**
"These practices scale from 5-person startups to Fortune 500 engineering organisations. Small teams get lightweight, practical guidance. Large teams get enterprise-ready systems without bureaucracy."

**Application:**
- In Capabilities descriptions ("Built for...")
- In engagement level descriptions
- In methodology sections

**Example:**
"Whether you're a 10-person product team or a 200-engineer organisation, we tailor our approach to your context—no cookie-cutter frameworks, no enterprise overhead where it doesn't belong."

### "Clear Engagement Journey" Reassurance

**Pattern:**
"1️⃣ Discovery & Situational Appraisal → 2️⃣ Evidence-Based Direction → 3️⃣ Embedded Improvement"

**Application:**
- Prominently featured on Capabilities pages
- Linked to engagement model (Advisory, Embedded, Fractional Exec)
- Connected to timeboxed retainer model

**Example:**
"**How we start:** 
1. **Week 1**: Situational appraisal—understand your context, challenges, goals (not selling, just listening)
2. **Weeks 2-4**: Evidence-based direction—establish baseline metrics, identify highest-value improvements
3. **Ongoing**: Embedded improvement—work alongside your teams, adapt continuously based on evidence

All delivered through our timeboxed retainer model—no fixed scope, no change orders, just shared commitment to outcomes."

## Engagement Model Reinforcement

### Core Messages to Reinforce

**Timeboxed Retainer Model:**
- Not buying hours, retaining strategic capacity
- No fixed deliverables, co-create outcomes
- Satisfaction guaranteed, full refund if not satisfied
- First-day risk reversal for longer engagements

**Three Models:**
1. **Advisory**: Strategic guidance, mentorship, no operational involvement
2. **Embedded**: Hands-on with teams, close collaboration, technical coaching
3. **Fractional Exec**: Executive-level, transformation ownership, leadership alignment

**Five Engagement Levels:**
- **Supportive (5%)**: ~1-2 hrs/week - Light input, async feedback
- **Regular (25%)**: ~6-8 hrs/week - Regular reviews, pairing
- **Deep (50%)**: ~14-16 hrs/week - Deep collaboration, hands-on
- **Strategic (75%)**: ~20-24 hrs/week - Transformation ownership
- **Full-time (100%)**: Not offered

**Key Differentiators:**
- Upfront payment with refund guarantee (risk reversal)
- No hourly billing, no change orders
- Deeply technical AND business-fluent (engineers who speak boardroom)
- Led by Microsoft MVP with 20+ years experience
