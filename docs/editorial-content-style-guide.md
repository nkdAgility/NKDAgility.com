# NKD Agility Editorial & Content Style Guide (2018–2025)

## Overall Tone and Voice

Our content voice is **authoritative yet approachable**, defined by radical candor, deep technical insight, and a direct, no-nonsense style. We speak as seasoned Agile/DevOps practitioners who aren’t afraid to challenge norms while genuinely helping readers improve. Key characteristics of our tone and voice include:

- **Candid and Truthful:** We tell it like it is. The writing should **challenge directly** (in the spirit of _Radical Candor_) – calling out ineffective practices or misconceptions without sugarcoating. For example, a blog post might flatly state “Cookie-cutter approaches will not work for you,” or even pose a blunt rhetorical question (“Who gives a crap what the DOD does?”) to emphasize a point. This directness grabs attention and builds trust. Importantly, candor is paired with a **helpful, empathetic approach** – we critique because we care about the reader’s success.

- **Expert and Technical:** Our voice demonstrates **technical depth and expertise** in DevOps, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and related domains. Content should reflect a deep understanding of frameworks and engineering practices, often diving into specifics. We confidently use proper terminology (e.g. _Definition of Done_, _Sprint Goal_, _Continuous Integration_) and provide evidence or data for claims. Always ground arguments in Agile/DevOps principles or real data. For instance, an article might cite that agile projects are “three times more likely to be successful” than waterfall, or reference Scrum Guide principles and metrics. This depth assures experienced readers that we know our stuff, while still explaining terms for less experienced audiences when necessary.

- **Conversational and Inclusive:** Even as experts, we maintain an **accessible, conversational tone**. The writing often uses first person (“I” or “we”) to share personal insights or experiences, and second person (“you”) to speak directly to the reader. This creates a coaching, mentoring vibe. The tone is professional but not overly formal – it’s okay to use a touch of humor or colloquial phrase to make a point (e.g., “by golly, everyone can” in a blog anecdote). We strive to sound like a trusted advisor: friendly, **enthusiastic about improvement**, but never condescending. Encourage readers with positivity and pragmatism.

- **Focused on Agile Values:** Every piece should **align with Agile, Lean, and DevOps values**. Emphasize concepts like transparency, inspection & adaptation, continuous improvement, collaboration, and delivering value. Our voice upholds these values consistently. For example, content will often highlight Scrum’s empirical approach (transparency, inspection, adaptation) or Lean thinking (flow efficiency, small batch sizes, etc.), reinforcing that our guidance is rooted in proven principles. We present ourselves as _thought leaders in Agile/DevOps_ who practice what we preach.

- **Bold but Respectful:** We take clear stances on industry practices. If we believe a certain approach is flawed or an anti-pattern, we say so plainly. However, **avoid harsh or personal attacks**. Critique ideas and methods, not people. The overall voice remains respectful and constructive – the goal is to provoke thought and inspire change, not to insult. Even when using strong language or vivid metaphors, it should come from a place of wanting to help organizations improve.

By combining candor, technical authority, and a personable tone, our content **stands out as credible and genuine**. Readers should immediately recognize the voice as Martin Hinshelwood’s/NKD Agility’s: frank, insightful, and passionately focused on agility and excellence.

## General Editorial Guidelines

These editorial standards apply to _all_ content to ensure consistency in quality, clarity, and SEO performance.

### Audience Expectations

Our primary audience spans **Agile practitioners, technical leaders, and business stakeholders** interested in improving their software delivery. This includes Scrum Masters, Agile coaches, DevOps engineers, Product Owners, executives overseeing transformations, and clients/prospective clients of NKD Agility. Given this range, content should be **educational and value-driven**:

- **Assume an intelligent reader** who is seeking practical guidance or thought leadership. They expect us to get to the point and offer insight born of real experience. Honor their time by delivering actionable knowledge or fresh perspectives, not generic fluff.

- **Vary technical depth by context:** Many readers will have technical backgrounds or familiarity with Agile concepts. It’s fine to dive into advanced topics (e.g. pipeline tooling, scaling patterns) for practitioner-focused pieces – in fact, it’s encouraged to satisfy experienced readers’ thirst for depth. When writing for a broader or executive audience (e.g. in case studies or overview blog posts), still include concrete details but **explain jargon or acronyms** on first use and clarify “why it matters” in business terms. For instance, if mentioning “SLEs (Service Level Expectations)”, briefly define it so newcomers aren’t lost.

- **Global audience, slight UK flavor:** Our readership is international. Write in standard English that is globally understood. We prefer UK spelling and grammar conventions (e.g. _organisational_ instead of _organizational_, _optimise_ instead of _optimize_) to remain consistent with Martin’s style. Avoid local slang that wouldn’t travel, but mild colloquialisms in English are fine when reinforcing a friendly tone.

- **What readers expect to find:** They come to us for honest advice on Agile/DevOps adoption, troubleshooting common pitfalls, case studies of transformation, and guidance on improving team practices. Ensure every piece delivers on its implicit promise – if the title is “How to Achieve Effective Sprint Goals,” the content should tangibly teach how to set and reach sprint goals (with examples, steps, or tips). Anticipate their questions and answer them within the content. A satisfied reader should leave with **new understanding or a concrete idea to apply**.

By understanding our audience’s context (often busy professionals and leaders) and needs, we tailor content that is immediately useful and relevant. Always ask, _“What will the reader gain from this?”_ and make sure that value is front and center.

### Sentence Structure and Tone

To ensure clarity and engagement, follow these guidelines for sentence and paragraph style:

- **Clarity through brevity:** Use relatively short, punchy sentences whenever possible. Aim for an average sentence length of \~15–20 words, with a mix of shorter and slightly longer sentences to create a good rhythm. Avoid rambling, run-on sentences that pack in multiple ideas – break them up for readability. Each sentence should convey _one idea clearly_. For example, instead of _“Scrum teams often struggle with Definition of Done because it’s not clearly defined which means there’s confusion and quality issues,”_ break it into: _“Scrum teams often struggle with the Definition of Done. When ‘Done’ isn’t clearly defined, confusion ensues and quality suffers.”_

- **Active voice:** Favor the active voice to make writing more direct and dynamic. _“The team completed the deployment”_ (active) is better than _“The deployment was completed by the team”_ (passive). Active voice highlights accountability and clarity – concepts that resonate with Agile culture. Use passive voice only if there’s a deliberate reason (e.g., focusing on the object of an action or when the actor is unknown or unimportant).

- **Conversational tone:** Write as if speaking to the reader in a knowledgeable yet friendly conversation. It’s acceptable (even encouraged) to use personal pronouns:

  - Use **“you”** to address the reader and make the advice feel personalized (e.g., “If you can’t ship working software at least every 30 days, then by definition you are not yet doing Scrum.”). This directly engages and challenges the reader.
  - Use **“we”** or **“I”** when drawing from experience or offering help (e.g., “I’ve seen this issue time and again…” or “In this article, we will explore…”). This adds authenticity and shows there’s a real practitioner behind the content.
  - Maintain a **professional persona**. While first-person is allowed, ensure it supports the content. Anecdotes or personal insights should have a clear lesson. Avoid overusing “I” such that it becomes self-centered; the focus should remain on the ideas and the reader’s context.

- **Tone is confident and encouraging:** Write with the confidence of an expert, but not arrogance. We **state opinions as informed facts** (“A clear Definition of Done provides transparency and focus – every team absolutely needs one”), backed by experience or data. Avoid tentative language like “maybe, possibly, I think” – our readers look to us for leadership. At the same time, temper certainty with empathy: acknowledge challenges and encourage readers. For instance, _“Changing entrenched habits is hard, but it’s necessary – and absolutely possible – to shorten release cycles. Start small…”_ This shows we understand their struggle and believe in their ability to improve.

- **Use of rhetorical and emphatic devices:** It’s fine to ask rhetorical questions or use repetition for emphasis, as long as it fits the candid style. For example: _“How can one learn to be agile in a world governed by waterfall? Indeed, our own industry has been shaped by these rules.”_ Such techniques can engage the reader’s thinking. Likewise, short standalone sentences or fragments can be used sparingly to drive a point home (e.g., _“The result? Chaos.”_ in a case study narrative). These add dramatic effect and break up monotony. Use italics or **bold** to emphasize key terms or phrases, but do so judiciously – primarily for introducing important concepts or highlighting definitions (as seen when we bold terms like **Higher success rate**, **Low Risk** in summary bullets).

- **Paragraph structure:** Keep paragraphs **short and focused**. Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph. Large walls of text deter readers, especially online. Each paragraph should center on a single idea or topic. If you find a paragraph running long or covering multiple sub-points, split it. In instructional content (e.g., step-by-step guides), one or two sentences per paragraph or bullet may suffice for easy scanning. Always consider readability: white space is a friend.

By constructing sentences and paragraphs with these principles, the content will be **easy to read and digest**. The tone will come through as confident, clear, and accessible – exactly what our audience expects from a trusted Agile advisor.

### Use of Metaphors, Analogies, and Media

We frequently employ **metaphors, analogies, and visual media** to clarify complex ideas and keep content engaging. Here’s how and when to use them:

- **Metaphors & Analogies:** Leverage comparisons to familiar concepts to illuminate Agile/DevOps principles. A well-chosen analogy can turn abstract ideas into something concrete and relatable. For example, to explain the concept of a Definition of Done, one article uses a **bakery analogy** – listing quality criteria (clean kitchen, fresh ingredients, proper cooking) that must be true for every product, just as a software team’s DoD ensures each increment meets basic standards. This helps readers outside software immediately grasp the point. Use metaphors that resonate with a broad professional audience (common workplace scenarios, team sports, manufacturing, everyday tasks, etc.). Ensure the metaphor _truly parallels_ the concept and doesn’t oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy. Always loop back and explicitly state the connection: e.g., “Just as a bakery won’t sell any item that fails its checklist, a Scrum team should not consider any increment ‘done’ unless it meets all criteria.”

- **Storytelling and examples:** Wherever possible, illustrate points with **real-world examples or brief stories**. This might be an anecdote from Martin’s coaching engagements, a historical case (e.g., the FBI Sentinel project failure to highlight waterfall vs. agile), or a hypothetical scenario that readers might find themselves in. Story elements make content memorable and credible. When using client stories or case studies, ensure you have permission to share details, and focus on the lessons learned rather than just self-promotion. Even a two-sentence example of a team overcoming a challenge can ground an abstract principle in reality. Use quotes from actual people sparingly to add authenticity (e.g., a client remark or a famous Agile quote from Scrum co-creators). Always attribute quotes to their sources. For instance, quoting Jeff Sutherland in context of Scrum’s effectiveness and citing _Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time_ adds weight to our claims.

- **Images and diagrams:** Visual media should **enhance understanding**. Include images, charts, or diagrams especially for process explanations, frameworks, or data-heavy discussions. For example, many of our “recipe” or “workshop” guides include images of Scrum boards, burndown charts, or workflow diagrams to illustrate the text (like a **Cycle Time Scatter Plot** image in a Sprint Review recipe). When using images:

  - Favor **informative graphics** over purely decorative images. Every image should have a purpose (illustrating a concept, showing a before/after comparison, presenting statistics in a chart, etc.).
  - Include clear **captions or alt text** describing what the image is showing, for accessibility and SEO. In Markdown, provide an alt text in quotes and a brief caption if needed (our site’s styling often handles figure captions via shortcodes or classes like `.post-img`).
  - **Branding and style:** Use our own branded graphics (NKD Agility framework diagrams, course illustrations, etc.) when available to maintain a consistent visual identity. If using external images, ensure we have the right to use them (public domain or appropriately licensed) and avoid any that clash with our professional tone.
  - Optimize images for web: use moderate resolution so they load quickly, and prefer common formats (JPEG, PNG, or SVG for diagrams).

- **Multimedia and embeds:** We produce and share videos (e.g., webinar recordings, YouTube podcasts) and occasionally might embed slide decks or audio. When referencing multimedia:

  - You may **embed videos** from YouTube or other platforms directly into the content (using approved embed codes or shortcodes). For instance, a newsletter might embed a YouTube video link for a podcast episode. Provide a brief introduction or context for the video so readers know why it’s worth their time.
  - If linking to an external video or podcast (Spotify, etc.), use a descriptive link text rather than just “Click here.” E.g., _“In this month’s Agile Actually Podcast, we discuss ‘life coaches masquerading as agile coaches’”_, with the title or topic as the hyperlink. This is good for SEO and accessibility.
  - Screenshots or code snippets (for technical how-to content) are also valuable media. Treat them like images: ensure they are clear, necessary, and annotated if needed. For code, prefer markdown code blocks for clarity and text-indexing.

In all cases, **integrate metaphors and media smoothly** into the article. They should support the narrative, not distract. Introduce a metaphor and carry it through consistently if you use one. Place images near the relevant text and reference them (“see diagram below”). Too many visuals or tangential anecdotes can break the flow, so use judiciously. A good rule: if a concept can be understood without the metaphor or image, adding it should make understanding _even easier_ or more engaging – that’s when it’s truly adding value.

### Formatting for SEO and Clarity

We adhere to formatting practices that improve both human readability and search engine optimization. Key guidelines include:

- **Descriptive Headings (H2, H3, H4):** Organize content with clear headings and subheadings. Use **Heading 2 (`##`) for main sections**, and subordinate headings (`###` H3, `####` H4) for structured subsections as needed. Every piece (especially longer articles) should be segmented logically under headings so readers can scan and navigate easily. Write headings that **summarize the section’s content and incorporate relevant keywords**. For example, instead of a vague heading like “Important Considerations,” use **“Definition of Done – Key Considerations for Teams”** if that’s the focus. This not only signals content to readers but also to search engines. Keep headings concise (a short phrase or single line) and use Title Case or Sentence case consistently (our convention is generally Title Case for headings). Avoid “cute” or cryptic headings – clarity trumps cleverness for section titles.

- **Front-load important information:** Both for SEO and busy readers, it’s effective to start with a brief summary of key points. We often include a **TL;DR or summary section** at the start of blogs and resources. This might be a **bulleted list of takeaways** or a short introductory paragraph in bold/lead style. For instance, an article on agile benefits might list in bullets: **Higher success rate**, **Cost effective**, **Low risk**, each with a one-line explanation. If using a TL;DR list, format it as an unordered list immediately after an intro or subheading “TL;DR;”. This improves SEO (as search engines may feature those bullet points) and serves readers who skim. Make sure each bullet is self-contained and meaningful.

- **Bullet points and numbered lists:** Use lists generously to improve scannability:

  - **Unordered bullets (`-` or `*`):** Great for collections of ideas, benefits, tips, or examples. In the body text, when you find yourself enumerating items or listing multiple points, break them into bullet points rather than a run-on sentence. Bullet lists should be parallel in structure (each starting with a similar part of speech) and succinct. For example, when listing advantages of an agile practice, use bullets starting with a strong keyword or phrase in bold, then a hyphen and explanation (as seen in TL;DR sections). This draws the eye.
  - **Ordered lists (`1. 2. 3.`):** Use for step-by-step processes or sequences. Our “Recipe” and “Workshop” content often rely on numbered steps to guide the reader through an activity or process in order. Ensure the sequence is logical and each step is clear and action-oriented (use imperative verbs: “Do X”, “Review Y”, “Decide Z…”). If sub-steps are needed under a main step, use nested lists with a different style (bullets under a numbered step).

- **Emphasis and styling:** Use **bold** to highlight crucial terms or sentences (sparingly – if everything is bold, nothing stands out). Use _italics_ for titles of books or emphasis on a word within a sentence. Inline `code formatting` can be used in technical contexts (like referencing a command, file name, or short code snippet in a line of text). Our site may have custom shortcodes or classes (like `{:.lead}` used to style introductory paragraphs in practices) – be consistent with those conventions (e.g., always mark the lead-in paragraph with the `.lead` class if the template uses it to display a larger font intro).

- **Links and anchor text:** Hyperlinks should be embedded in descriptive anchor text, not raw URLs and not generic “click here” text. This is vital for SEO. For internal links, use Hugo shortcodes or relative paths to ensure they remain correct if the site structure changes. For example: use `{{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}` to link to the “transparency” tag page, or `./../_guides/scrum-guide.md` to reference an on-site guide file. For external links, link the relevant phrase (e.g., _“the 2020 Scrum Guide”_ as anchor text, rather than “[link](http://scrumguidelink)”). Always double-check that each link is valid and points to the intended resource. Where appropriate, set external links to open in a new tab (depending on site platform settings). Also ensure to **link to our own content frequently** when contextually relevant – e.g., link to a previous blog post or a “principle” definition page when a term is mentioned. This internal linking boosts SEO and keeps readers on our site.

- **SEO metadata:** While our main focus is on high-quality content, remember to fill in SEO-related fields:

  - _Title tags:_ The page title (often auto-generated from the content title in our static site) should be concise (50-60 characters) and include primary keywords and our brand if possible. The `title` frontmatter is usually sufficient and should be carefully crafted.
  - _Meta description:_ In the frontmatter `description` field, provide a 1-2 sentence summary (155–160 characters) of the content. This should be enticing and include important keywords, as it often appears in search result snippets. For example, _“Learn how to effectively apply Professional Scrum, overcome common implementation challenges, and improve team performance with practical agile insights and training.”_. This description clearly tells search engines and users what to expect.
  - Use appropriate tags and categories (taxonomy) in frontmatter to help organize content on the site and signal relevance (e.g., a post about DevOps should include “DevOps” in tags or categories).
  - **URL slugs:** Our CMS usually generates slugs from titles, but check that the slug (permalink) is clean and includes keywords. Avoid extremely long slugs or ones with stopwords; short and meaningful is best (e.g., `/resources/blog/dod-illegal-to-do-waterfall` is better than a full sentence URL).

- **Readability considerations:** Many readers will skim before committing to a full read. Use **section summaries or concluding sentences** that wrap up a section’s point, as some will jump to those. When a section is lengthy, consider adding a mid-section one-line summary in italics or a breakout quote. Also, break up text with blockquotes or call-out quotes for key insights. For example, a bold insight from the text can be set as a blockquote to draw attention (with proper citation if it’s from an external source or a well-known saying). This adds visual variety and highlights key messages.

- **Consistency:** Follow a consistent style throughout a piece and across pieces. This includes how we format headings (e.g., always capitalizing “Scrum Master” and “Product Owner”), how we refer to the company (use “NKD Agility” or “naked Agility with Martin Hinshelwood” consistently), and punctuation (Oxford comma is recommended for clarity in lists). Maintain consistency in terminology (for instance, don’t switch between “backlog item” and “user story” arbitrarily – choose the term that fits the context and stick with it within the article). Consistency builds credibility and a smooth reading experience.

By applying these formatting guidelines, we ensure our content is not only **engaging to human readers but also optimized for search engines**. Well-structured, well-formatted content will rank better and be far more digestible, reinforcing our reputation for clarity and expertise.

### Source Citation and Linking Policies

Credibility is paramount. When we present facts, stats, or specific ideas that aren’t common knowledge or originate from external sources, **provide proper citations or references**:

- **External sources:** If quoting or closely paraphrasing an external publication (blog, article, study, official guide), cite it. The citation format on our site can simply be a hyperlink embedded in the text referencing the source (e.g., _“according to the 15th State of Agile Report”_ with the text linking to that report). For academic or long-form pieces, we can also list sources at the end under a “References” heading or use markdown footnotes – but in most blog-style content, an inline hyperlink is sufficient and least disruptive. Ensure the source is authoritative (industry surveys, well-known Agile experts, Scrum.org or Microsoft documentation, etc.). Avoid linking to random low-quality content; stick to reputable references that strengthen our point. If multiple sources were consulted to form our opinion but not directly quoted, a “Further Reading” or “References” section can be included in the frontmatter or footer (as seen in some Practice pages where Scrum.org blog posts are listed as references).

- **Plagiarism and originality:** All content must be original or clearly credited. **Do not copy-paste** from other blogs or forums. If we need to include an excerpt (say, a definition from the Scrum Guide or a snippet of someone’s quote), put it in quotes and cite the source. Our “Guides” section is an exception, where we reproduce external guides (like the Scrum Guide) verbatim with permission – those pages are intentionally marked as external content. For all other content, writers should synthesize information and express it in our unique voice. When in doubt, err on the side of citing a source; it shows honesty and gives readers avenues to learn more.

- **Internal linking etiquette:** We have a rich library of content; leverage it. Link to related **internal resources, case studies, or definitions** to provide context without re-explaining in every piece. For example, if an article mentions “Evidence-Based Management (EBM)”, link that phrase to our EBM method page if it exists. Or if we discuss a concept we’ve blogged about before (like _Professional Scrum Teams build working software_), link to that blog post. Internal links should use the proper Hugo ref shortcode or relative path as noted, so they don’t break. Also, maintain a balance – too many links can make text hard to read. Link the first occurrence of a term or concept in a section rather than every occurrence.

- **Link tone and transparency:** Make it clear what the reader is clicking. If the link is to an external site, consider indicating it if not obvious, especially if it’s an action (e.g., “download the report (PDF)”). For internal links, ensure the anchor text precisely describes the target content (“definition of done” linking to a DoD article, etc.). Avoid overly promotional link text; even our CTAs in content should feel helpful. For instance, instead of “**Buy Now – 20% OFF**”, in an article context we might phrase it more tactfully: “Enroll in the upcoming **Applying Professional Scrum course (now 20% off)**”.

- **Case studies and clients:** When writing case studies or referencing client work, follow confidentiality policies. We only publish identifiable client stories with permission. If permission is given (as for the Ghana Police Service or SLB case studies), it’s fine to use the organization’s real name and details in a positive light. Otherwise, generalize the story (e.g., “a large financial institution” instead of the client’s name) to protect privacy. Even with permission, do not disclose sensitive metrics that the client hasn’t approved for public release. Stick to outcomes and high-level data that showcase improvement.

- **Footnotes/endnotes:** Our platform might support footnotes, but typically we haven’t used academic-style footnotes in blog content. If needed for an online article, an inline parenthetical or a hyperlink suffices. Reserve footnotes for print-style publications or extremely detailed posts where side comments are needed.

In summary, **every factual claim we make should be verifiable**, either by a citation or by logical explanation. Linking to high-quality sources bolsters our credibility and helps readers trust our guidance. And by thoughtfully interlinking our own content, we reinforce our expertise and keep readers exploring our site.

_(Note: The “Guides” section of the site consists of reproductions of external reference materials (like official Scrum guides) and is excluded from these editorial rules on tone. Those pages remain as-is to preserve the original content’s integrity.)_

## Guidelines for “Resources” Content Writers (Educational Content)

“Resources” content is primarily educational and thought leadership material aimed at practitioners and clients seeking to learn. This category includes **blog posts, how-to articles, best practice guides (e.g. “Practices” and “Principles”), “Recipes” (step-by-step facilitation guides), and workshop outlines**. The goal of Resources content is to **deliver value and insight**, establishing NKD Agility as a trusted expert, without overtly selling. Below are guidelines tailored to creating high-quality Resources content.

### Purpose and Desired Outcomes

**Purpose:** Resources content exists to **educate, inform, and empower** our audience. Each piece should address a question or need that Agile/DevOps practitioners have, or provoke thoughtful consideration of better ways to work. Common purposes:

- **Share Expertise:** Explain complex concepts (e.g. _Empirical Process Control_, _Scaling Scrum_, _DevOps strategies_) in an understandable way. Provide depth that helps a practitioner level-up their knowledge.
- **Offer Practical Guidance:** Many resources serve as “how-to” guides or best practices that readers can apply. For example, outlining how to conduct a Sprint Review in a “Recipe” format, or steps to implement a Definition of Done.
- **Inspire Change:** Through case examples or bold opinion pieces, we aim to inspire organizations to adopt more agile mindsets. A blog might challenge traditional thinking and encourage readers to try a new approach (e.g. “Stop doing Waterfall – even the DOD moved to Agile!”).
- **Document Our Thought Leadership:** Resources also capture Martin’s and the team’s thought leadership – our evolving ideas, principles, and methods. By publishing these, we not only help others but also solidify NKD Agility’s intellectual capital (for instance, articulating our own “principles” or unique frameworks).

**Desired Outcomes:** After engaging with a Resources article, a reader should:

- **Learn something new** – a concept clarified, a technique learned, or a myth debunked. They should have actionable takeaways (e.g., “I will go create a Definition of Done with my team using these tips” or “I understand why smaller batch sizes matter now”).
- **Trust our expertise** – the quality and insight of the content should make the reader more confident that NKD Agility (and Martin) are authorities in this domain. This trust often leads them to further explore our site or consider us for training/consulting down the line (an indirect lead generation aspect).
- **Feel challenged and motivated** – many of our pieces have a perspective that pushes the reader a bit out of their comfort zone (radical candor in advice). A good outcome is the reader feels a sense of urgency or inspiration to improve their way of working (“We really _should_ address our technical debt, I see how it’s holding us back after reading that article”).
- **Engage further** – maybe they bookmark the article, share it with colleagues, or comment (depending on site capabilities). At the very least, they might click on related links we provided (videos, other blogs) to continue learning.

Always write with these end outcomes in mind. We’re not just publishing content for its own sake; it should _make a difference_ for the reader and in turn strengthen our community and brand.

### Maintaining Tone and Clarity in Resources Content

All Resources pieces should embody the overall tone described earlier – candid, knowledgeable, and direct – with slight adjustments based on sub-type:

- **Thought Leadership Blogs:** These can be more opinionated and narrative. Maintain a conversational tone, as if Martin or the author is speaking directly to the community. It’s okay to use first person anecdotes, humor, or rhetorical flourish here, as long as the message is clear. Keep the language professional; even if we provoke (e.g., calling out “excuses” organizations make), avoid slang that might offend. The clarity comes from a logical flow of argument: state the problem, share insight or evidence, then conclude with recommendations or a strong closing thought.
- **Instructional Guides (Practices/Principles):** These require utmost clarity and a slightly more **formal instructional tone**, since they might be referenced as canonical guidance. Define terms explicitly (possibly with bold or italics on first mention), and use simple, straightforward sentences. Imagine a Scrum Master might hand this article to their team – it should be easily understood by all. However, still speak _to_ the reader (“you/your team”) to keep it engaging. Use subheadings for each aspect (e.g., “What is X?”, “Why X matters”, “How to implement X”) to create a predictable structure. Clarity is king – if a sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways, rewrite it.
- **Recipes & Workshops:** These are heavily instructional and procedural. Keep tone encouraging and precise. You can use a friendly voice (e.g., “Feel free to show your real data…”) but avoid any ambiguity in instructions. It’s often effective to address the facilitator directly: “This workshop is designed to help your group realize… Follow these steps… Ask participants to do Y.” Clarity is reinforced with numbering and bullet points for each step, as well as timing indicators and expected outcomes. Double-check that any reader could follow the instructions without needing the author present. If certain terms or techniques are used (like _Liberating Structures_ in workshops), provide a quick explanation or link, since clarity means not assuming everyone knows the reference.
- **Case Study-like Resources:** Occasionally, a blog in Resources might essentially be a case narrative or a reflection on an engagement (though we classify official case studies under Marketing). In these, maintain an educational focus: frame it as _lessons learned_ from the story rather than a promotional piece. The tone should still be factual and direct (“We encountered X problem and addressed it with Y method, resulting in Z” – and then derive a general lesson). Clarity is served by separating the story from the analysis (use italics or a quote style if narrating a scenario, then a clear takeaway statement).

Across all sub-types, **write with empathy for the learner.** Don’t talk down to the reader; instead, guide them. For example, rather than “Many teams fail because they don’t do X,” we might say “If your team is struggling, often it’s due to a missing X. Try this…”. We acknowledge common failures while focusing on solutions.

Additionally, maintain consistency with technical terms and abbreviations. Always spell out an acronym the first time with its acronym in parentheses – e.g., “Service Level Expectation (SLE)” – then you can use SLE thereafter. This ensures newcomers aren’t lost, maintaining clarity.

Lastly, encourage clarity by doing a **quick audience check**: After writing, ask “If I were a \[Scrum Master/new Agile coach/dev team member], would this make sense? Are any sentences or terms confusing?” Revise anything that could be misread. The tone should be **crystal-clear and confidently helpful**.

### Use of Storytelling, Examples, and Quotes in Resources

Resources content can greatly benefit from **illustrative storytelling** and authoritative references, as long as they serve the educational purpose:

- **Storytelling:** Integrate short stories or scenarios to ground abstract advice. For example, when explaining why a sprint goal is important, you might sketch a story: _“In one client team we coached, they skipped setting Sprint Goals and found stakeholders constantly changing direction mid-sprint. When we introduced a clear sprint goal, the team finally had a beacon – and focus and morale improved.”_ Such mini-case examples (anonymized unless we have permission) make content relatable. Keep stories concise – a few sentences to set up problem and resolution is usually enough – and explicitly tie them to the lesson (“This story shows how a simple practice like a Sprint Goal can resolve confusion”). Storytelling should not overpower the instructional part; use it as seasoning to keep readers engaged.

- **Relatable examples and metaphors:** As discussed, use analogies to explain _why_ something matters. In a Practice or Principle article, it might be helpful to include an everyday analogy (like the earlier bakery example, or comparing technical debt to a “garden that needs regular weeding”). Ensure the example is appropriate for the audience’s context – many of our readers work in tech, so tech analogies or well-known pop culture/engineering metaphors can work. But also consider diverse audiences; not everyone loves sports analogies, for instance. Aim for broadly understandable comparisons.

- **Data and evidence:** When available, **use data or specific examples as evidence**. Our readers appreciate when we back up claims with numbers or authoritative statements. If we say “agile projects have higher success rates,” cite the study or report (and include the stat, e.g., “_three times more likely to succeed_”). If we mention improvements we’ve seen, quantify them if possible (“After adopting continuous delivery, deployment frequency increased from monthly to daily”). This lends weight to our advice and also serves as mini case evidence.

- **Quotes and citations:** In educational content, it’s powerful to quote **reputable sources** to reinforce points. Feel free to quote the Agile Manifesto, Scrum Guide, industry leaders, or relevant research. For example, our Definition of Done page directly quotes the Scrum Guide’s definition of Done for emphasis. Format quotes as blockquotes with citation if possible (e.g., “-- _The 2020 Scrum Guide_” as a cite attribution). Use quotes to support, not replace, our explanations – introduce a quote and then discuss its significance. Also consider pulling key quotes as call-outs if the platform supports it, to highlight key wisdom (e.g., highlight “Scrum is proven to deliver twice the features in half the time” – Jeff Sutherland).

- **Visual examples:** In resources like Recipes or technical blogs, a screenshot or diagram can be an “example” too. For instance, including an image of a cumulative flow diagram when discussing Kanban practices provides a concrete reference. If we mention a tool or UI (like Azure Boards or a build pipeline), a small screenshot with an arrow pointing out the key element can save lengthy explanation. Ensure any sensitive data in images is blurred or fictionalized. Label images “Figure 1: X” if helpful to reference in text (“As shown in Figure 1, a stable CFD indicates…”).

- **Acceptable storytelling vs. off-topic tangents:** Do use anecdotes from our real work or history of Agile (e.g., the FBI Sentinel anecdote in a blog is very relevant to the point about waterfall vs agile). **Don’t** include stories that don’t reinforce the content’s main message. For example, an amusing personal story that isn’t clearly tied to an Agile lesson will just confuse readers – save those for perhaps a personal blog not on the company site. Every narrative should have a “moral” that aligns with our teaching point.

- **Length and placement:** In a typical blog or article, a short narrative might work well as an opener to hook the reader, or as a supporting example mid-way. For very tutorial-like pieces (e.g., “how to set up a CI pipeline”), you might omit narrative in favor of directly teaching. Recognize where the audience wants you to “get to the steps” and where a story will keep them interested. A good practice: after writing a draft, identify any story or example and verify that the article **still makes sense if that part is skipped**. If yes, the story is non-essential and should probably be trimmed or tightened. If no (the story carries a key point), then it’s well integrated.

In summary, **do use stories, examples, and quotes to make our Resources content vivid and credible**, but always ensure they serve the learning objective. The readers should remember the principle or practice _because_ the example illuminated it, rather than just remembering an unrelated story.

### Calls-to-Action (CTAs) in Resources Content

While Resources content is primarily educational, we can still gently guide readers to further engagement. The key is to keep CTAs **subtle, relevant, and helpful** rather than salesy. Here’s how to handle CTAs for Resources:

- **Educational CTAs:** Often the best “call to action” after a resource article is to suggest further learning. This might be:

  - **Internal recommendations:** e.g., “If you found this useful, you might also enjoy our article on Continuous Delivery in Scrum” (linking to another relevant resource). Or “Download our free cheat-sheet on Sprint Planning” (if we have one).
  - **External next steps:** e.g., “For a deeper dive, consider reading \[Scrum.org’s guide to EBM]” or “Check out the official Scrum Guide for the complete definition of terms.” This positions us as caring more about the reader’s growth than pushing our agenda.
  - **Engagement CTA:** inviting comments or questions (if the platform allows). Example: “Have questions about applying this practice? Tweet us @nkdAgility or drop a comment below – let’s discuss.” This can encourage community engagement.

- **Subtle marketing CTAs:** It’s acceptable to include a soft mention of our services or training **if very relevant to the topic** and done in a non-intrusive way. For instance, at the end of a blog about improving agility, a line like: _“If your organization needs help implementing these ideas, **our consulting services** can provide hands-on guidance – feel free to reach out.”_ The tone should be one of offering help, not a hard sell. Another example: “Many of these practices are taught in our Professional Scrum courses. Consider joining our next Applying Professional Scrum workshop to experience this first-hand.” Notice this frames it as a logical next step for the reader’s benefit.

- **Placement and format:** Typically, CTAs in resources content come **at the end** of the article, after the educational content is complete (so as not to interrupt the learning). They might be in a final paragraph or a highlighted box. Our site often has a template “connect with us” box or similar (e.g., an invitation for a free consultation or AMA) at the bottom of posts. As a writer, you may not need to manually add that if it’s automatically included, but you should write the conclusion in a way that segues naturally into a possible CTA. For example, concluding sentence could be: _“Ultimately, achieving true agility is a journey – one we’re passionate about helping teams navigate.”_ This sentiment naturally leads into a contact-us prompt.

- **Tone of CTAs:** Keep the same candid, authentic voice. For instance, _“If you’ve read this far, you’re clearly serious about improving. Why not **talk to us**? We offer a free 30-minute consultation to help assess your agile adoption. No sales pitch – just sharing ideas to get you unstuck.”_ This kind of CTA is friendly and aligned with our brand (candid and helpful). Contrast that with a generic corporate line like “Contact us to optimize your business today!!!” – which would feel out of character. Always frame CTAs as an _opportunity for the reader_, not a favor to us. We want them to feel we’re extending an invitation, not closing a sale.

- **Frequency:** Not every resource article needs an explicit CTA beyond perhaps a related-links section. It’s fine for purely educational posts to end with a reflective conclusion and no “action” required. Use your judgment – if the content naturally invites a next step (e.g., try something, learn more, reach out), include a CTA. If it’s a self-contained think piece, a solid closing thought is enough. We don’t want to dilute strong content by tacking on a forced marketing line.

- **Case of case studies in resources:** As noted, some case studies might appear under Resources. Those should follow **marketing CTA guidelines** (discussed later) since their intent is promotional. For a case study listed in Resources, do include a CTA like “Interested in similar results? **Contact us** to discuss how we can help your team.” This is expected in a success-story context.

In summary, for Resources content, **prioritize the reader’s journey**. The best CTA feels like a logical extension of the learning: the reader gets value from the content and is offered a way to get even more value (more knowledge, a tool, a conversation, etc.). Keep it optional and cordial.

### Do’s and Don’ts for Resources Content

**Do’s:**

- **Do be factual and cite sources:** Back up assertions with references or experiences. If you say “X is a common antipattern,” briefly describe how you know (e.g., “we’ve observed it across multiple clients”) or cite a source. This boosts credibility.
- **Do share personal insights:** It’s valuable when Martin or other authors inject their own learnings (“In my 10 years of coaching, I found…”) as it adds uniqueness. Just keep it relevant to the topic.
- **Do use consistent Agile terminology:** Use terms as defined in the Scrum Guide or relevant framework. For example, always capitalise Scrum roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner), events (Sprint Review) and artifacts when referring to the formal concept. Use “Sprint Backlog” not “sprint task list,” etc., unless explaining an informal concept. Consistency here establishes authority.
- **Do break up complex topics:** If a topic is very large, consider a series of articles or splitting into sections with clear headings for each subtopic. It’s better to have a focused piece (e.g., one article just on “Definition of Done” and another on “Acceptance Criteria” rather than one mega-post).
- **Do encourage reflection:** Pose occasional questions to readers to think about their own situation (“Does your team have a shared Definition of Done? If not, you’re likely seeing quality issues.”). This engagement technique can be effective in resources content.
- **Do proofread and edit:** Ensure grammar and spelling are correct (our credibility can be undermined by sloppy errors). Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing. Consider having a peer review for technical accuracy and clarity.
- **Do incorporate visuals for learning:** As mentioned, diagrams or tables (like a before/after comparison chart, a checklist table, etc.) can be very helpful in educational content. Feel free to include them when they clarify information better than text alone.

**Don’ts:**

- **Don’t turn it into a sales pitch:** The quickest way to lose reader trust in an educational article is to make it promotional. Avoid excessive self-praise or mentions of our services in the main body. For instance, don’t write “Our company’s unique method solves all these problems easily.” Instead, describe the method/concept generically; you can mention we specialize in it in a light touch (or save it for the CTA).
- **Don’t use fluff or filler:** Every paragraph should have substance. Avoid generic motivational statements or buzzwords that don’t add concrete value (e.g., “In today’s world of digital transformation, synergy is key” – this says nothing specific). Our style is pragmatic and content-rich, so get straight to useful points.
- **Don’t assume the reader knows previous content:** Each resource piece should stand on its own enough to be understood. While we encourage internal links, don’t write “As I wrote in my last blog…” and then skip explaining – give a brief summary or context so new readers aren’t lost. It’s fine to build on ideas, but provide context or links for those who might not have read the prior piece.
- **Don’t overwhelm with too many ideas:** It’s better to focus deeply on a few key points than superficially touch ten points. If you find a draft has an unwieldy scope, refine the topic. For example, a blog that started as “10 Tips for Agile Transformation” might be more powerful if it becomes “3 Crucial Tips…” with richer detail on each.
- **Don’t breach confidentiality or sensitivity:** When sharing stories, strip out any identifying details unless permitted. Also avoid disparaging specific organizations or individuals. We can critique practices (even common bad practices in companies) without naming and shaming. Keep it professional and constructive.
- **Don’t neglect structure:** A common mistake is writing a “stream of consciousness.” Always impose structure with an intro, body sections, and conclusion. Unstructured content confuses readers – use those headings and lists!
- **Don’t exceed reasonable length without good reason:** While comprehensive coverage is good, be mindful that extremely long posts may lose readers. If you’re over \~2,500-3,000 words, double-check that everything there is necessary. Long form is fine when truly needed (some technical how-tos or deep case studies might be lengthy), but we can often split or tighten content to respect the reader’s time.

Following these do’s and don’ts will help ensure Resources content remains **high-quality, trustworthy, and valuable** to our audience, reinforcing our position as a go-to resource for Agile and DevOps knowledge.

### Structural Guidelines (Length, Organization, Cadence) for Resources

**Length:** Resources content can vary in length based on format:

- **Blog articles/opinion pieces:** Aim for roughly **1,000 to 1,500 words** for a standard blog post. This length is typically enough to explore a concept with some depth while remaining readable in one sitting. However, more in-depth posts (especially those with multiple subheadings, examples, etc.) can go up to \~2,000+ words. Only exceed 2,500 words if the topic genuinely warrants a comprehensive deep dive (e.g., a definitive guide). If a post is short (\~500 words), ensure it truly delivers value; usually that length suits simple announcements or very focused tips, but most educational topics benefit from more elaboration.
- **Practice/Principle write-ups:** These might be **shorter reference-style pieces** (some of our principle definitions are just a few paragraphs). If the principle can be succinctly defined and explained in 300-600 words, that’s fine – brevity can be clarity for fundamentals. But if explaining usage or common misconceptions, it may extend to \~1000 words. The key is to be thorough enough that the reader doesn’t need another source to understand the principle.
- **Recipes/Workshops:** These guides often include lists and may be long due to steps and options. They could range from **500 to 1500 words**, but since they are frequently list-heavy, the “word count” is less of an issue than completeness and clarity of steps. A recipe should be as long as needed to clearly enumerate the flow and options (some workshop guides might span a few pages if printed, given all the instructions). It’s okay if these feel longer; readers will often jump to the parts they need (thanks to headings for each part). Use headings for major parts and keep each step description as concise as possible to control length.
- **Mixed media affecting length:** If an article contains several images or diagrams, the textual length can be a bit shorter since visuals carry some explanatory load. But accompany images with sufficient text explanation for SEO (search engines can’t read images) and for those who skim without examining graphics closely.

In all cases, **focus on quality over arbitrary length**. It’s better to have a dense, info-rich 800-word article than a 2000-word one full of repetition. Conversely, it’s better to have a thorough 2000-word guide than a shallow 800-word treatment that leaves questions unanswered.

**Organization:** The structure of Resources content should generally follow a clear flow:

- **Title:** A concise, descriptive title that clearly indicates the topic and, if possible, the benefit (e.g., _“How to Set and Achieve Effective Sprint Goals”_ rather than _“Sprint Goals 101”_). Front-load keywords in the title for SEO.
- **Introduction:** A short intro paragraph or two that _hooks the reader_ and states what the article will cover. Often we identify a problem or question in the intro to signal relevance (“Many teams set Sprint Goals, but few actually use them – this article explains how to make Sprint Goals truly effective.”). The intro can end with a **TL;DR summary or bullet points** of key takeaways for longer pieces (as discussed under formatting).
- **Body with Headings:** Divide the body into logical sections with H2s (and H3s for subsections as needed). A typical flow might be:

  - Background or “What/Why” section explaining the concept or problem.
  - One or more sections addressing solutions, best practices, or main arguments.
  - Perhaps a section on common pitfalls or FAQs (e.g., “Common Mistakes with X” or “Misconceptions”).
  - Possibly a short case example section if relevant (“Case in Point: How X Team Improved Y”).

- **Conclusion:** Sum up the key point or challenge the reader to take action. Conclusions can be a few sentences reinforcing the main message. They may naturally lead into a CTA or at least provide closure. For instance, “By defining Done and sticking to it, teams create transparency and trust. It may take effort to establish, but as we’ve seen, the payoff is a higher-quality product and happier stakeholders. Isn’t that worth it?”
- **References/Further Reading (optional):** If we heavily referenced specific materials or want to direct readers to more resources, we can list them at the end. This is common in practice pages where we credit Scrum.org sources, etc.

Each type of resource might tweak this structure (e.g., a Recipe will have a introduction -> list of steps -> conclusion format; a workshop outline might just be segmented by “Purpose/Duration/Materials/Steps/Takeaways” as we saw). Use consistent section headers for similar content types to create uniformity (all Recipes should have a “Flow Steps” section, all Practices might start with a definition paragraph followed by “Why X Matters”, etc., if applicable).

**Publishing Cadence:** For Resources content, consistency helps build an audience, but quality is paramount. Guidelines for cadence:

- **Blog Posts:** Aim for a regular cadence such as _1-2 blog posts per month_. This keeps our site fresh and signals to readers (and search engines) that new insights are coming at a steady pace. If possible, establish a predictable schedule (e.g., a blog post every other Tuesday) so that marketing/newsletters can coordinate around it. However, do not force content out just to meet a quota – if a month has no strong topic to cover, it’s better to skip than post something subpar. Conversely, if there’s a timely subject (new Scrum Guide release, industry event) or a wealth of topics, it’s fine to post more frequently.
- **Practices/Methods/Principles library:** These pieces might be updated or added in batches rather than continuously. When developing this knowledge base, coordinate releases so they can be announced or indexed properly. It might make sense to publish a series of related practice pages together (e.g., a set of Scrum principles all at once) so they cross-link and provide a comprehensive set. These are generally evergreen content, so cadence is “as needed until library is complete, then occasional updates.”
- **Recipes/Workshops:** Often tied to training or learning kit development. They may come out alongside new workshops we design or after we test a method in the field. No fixed cadence, but ensure they are kept up-to-date. If we refer to a workshop in a blog or newsletter, ensure the corresponding recipe page is published.
- **Reviews and updates:** Because our domain evolves (new Scrum Guide editions, new DevOps tools), schedule periodic reviews of older resources (perhaps annually or when major changes occur). Update content to keep it current (and add an “Updated on \[date]” note if substantial changes). Outdated advice can hurt credibility, so part of our cadence is maintenance, not just new creation.

**Header types and numbering:** Use H2 for main sections. If numbering sections (e.g., “Step 1, Step 2…”), use either an ordered list or include the number in the heading text (but the latter is usually not needed if using a list). Ensure hierarchy is logical – don’t skip from H2 to H4.
For multi-part posts (if we do a series), mention in the intro or title that it’s Part 1 of X, and link to the other parts when available.

In summary, structure every resource piece so that it’s **easy to follow and delivers on its promise**. Plan the outline before writing to maintain focus. Keep to a sustainable writing and publishing rhythm so content remains fresh but also high caliber.

## Guidelines for “Marketing” Content Writers (Promotional & Lead-Gen Content)

Marketing content is geared towards **lead generation, promotional messaging, and showcasing our services or success stories**. This includes **Case Studies**, **Training promotions (course announcements, offers)**, **Newsletters**, and any asset intended to convert interest into action (e.g., landing page copy, product/program one-pagers). The tone should remain consistent with our brand but tuned to persuade and excite potential clients. Below are guidelines specific to marketing-oriented content.

### Purpose and Goals of Marketing Content

**Purpose:** Marketing content’s primary purpose is to **attract, engage, and convince potential clients or students** to take a next step with NKD Agility. Each type has its nuanced purpose:

- **Case Studies:** To provide credible, narrative evidence of the value we deliver. They showcase real-world challenges we solved and the outcomes achieved, thereby building trust with prospects facing similar issues.
- **Training/Service Promotions:** To inform and entice our audience about offerings – upcoming training classes, workshops, new services, discounts, events – and encourage sign-ups or inquiries. They clearly articulate the benefit of the offering (e.g., what someone gains by attending a class or engaging our consulting).
- **Newsletters:** To maintain ongoing engagement with our community and leads. A newsletter blends valuable content (mini-articles, tips) with marketing (upcoming events, highlights of offerings) to nurture interest. Its purpose is both to educate and to remind our audience of our capabilities/offers, keeping NKD Agility top-of-mind.
- **Website Marketing Pages (e.g., landing pages, capabilities pages):** To convert visitors by describing our services, approach, and differentiators in a compelling way, and direct them to contact or purchase.

**Goals (Outcomes):**

- **Generate Leads/Sales:** Ultimately, marketing content should drive an action – register for a class, fill out a contact form, download a resource (for lead capture), or share the content (expanding reach). For instance, a case study should ideally prompt a reader to say “I want those results too – let’s contact them.” A training promo should lead to course registrations.
- **Showcase Value and Differentiation:** Through storytelling and clear benefit statements, marketing materials must highlight _why NKD Agility_. Whether through a case study result (e.g., “800+ teams unified and delivery accelerated”) or a newsletter blurb about a new approach, the content should communicate our unique value, expertise, and the outcomes we enable, setting us apart from generic competitors.
- **Strengthen Brand Personality:** Marketing content is often someone’s first impression of us. It should reinforce the brand personality: candid (we tell real stories, including challenges), expert (we demonstrate knowledge), and caring (we focus on client success, not just self-promotion). If done well, even a promo piece makes the reader think, “These people are genuine and know what they’re doing.”
- **Build Relationships:** Especially with newsletters and social promos, the goal is to build a relationship over time. Offering consistent value (e.g., a useful tip in a newsletter alongside a promo) builds goodwill, so when the reader has a need, they think of us. Engagement metrics (opens, clicks, shares) can indicate success here.

Every marketing piece should be measured against: _Does this motivate the target audience to move closer to working with us?_ That could be an immediate sign-up or just increased trust – both are forward moves in the marketing funnel.

### Tone and Consistency in Marketing Content

Marketing content must balance a **persuasive tone** with the authenticity and directness of our brand voice. We want to excite interest without slipping into hollow marketing jargon. Guidelines for tone:

- **Confident and Positive:** Marketing copy should be upbeat and optimistic. We focus on _solutions and successes_. For example, a case study will naturally describe a problem, but overall the tone is one of overcoming and achievement (“From Fragmentation to Flow” is literally a positive transformation framing). Use positive language that highlights improvement: _increased, accelerated, optimized, unified, improved, successful_. Even when acknowledging initial challenges, quickly pivot to what was done to address them and the good outcomes.
- **Client-Centric:** Write from the perspective of **what the client/customer gains**, not what we do. This means using more “you” or speaking about the client than “we.” For instance, instead of “We offer comprehensive training courses that cover X, Y, Z,” frame it as “**Master X, Y, Z** through our comprehensive training courses, so your team can \[benefit].” Always connect features of our service to benefits for the client. In case studies, while telling our role, keep focus on the client’s story (“NKD Agility helped \[Client] achieve \[Outcome]” – the client is the hero with our support).
- **Maintain Radical Candor (appropriately):** Even in marketing, our frank style can be an asset – it differentiates us from overly polished corporate speak. For example, a bold statement in a promo like “Too many organizations hide behind agile theatre – we help you cut through the BS and get real results” aligns with our candid voice and grabs attention. However, ensure candor doesn’t come off as abrasive in marketing context. Challenge the reader, but also inspire them. E.g., “If your agile adoption is stalling, it’s likely due to lack of empiricism. We won’t sugarcoat it – but we will fix it together.”
- **Avoid Hype and Exaggeration:** It’s crucial for consistency that we **do not make promises we can’t keep or use cliched buzzwords** just for effect. Phrases like “revolutionary solutions” or “world-class results guaranteed” sound generic and inauthentic. Instead, use concrete language and let facts speak (e.g., state actual improvements from case studies, “20% increase in delivery frequency in 3 months” rather than “massive increase in productivity”). Keep superlatives believable and backed by evidence or context.
- **Encouraging and Inclusive:** Marketing tone should invite the reader to envision success with us. Use inclusive language – “Let’s transform your workflow” or “Join the next cohort of professionals…”. This avoids lecturing and instead positions us as partners. For training promos, be motivational: learning agile can be daunting, so we cheer them on: “Unlock your potential” (as seen in our newsletter title: _“Unlock your potential in 2024 – Master Scrum with NKD Agility”_).
- **Voice consistency:** If multiple people write marketing content, maintain consistency by using the same person perspective and style across pieces. For NKD Agility, most marketing copy is from the company perspective (first person plural “we”) or third-person describing what NKD Agility (or Martin) does. E.g., case studies often read like an article about us: “NKD Agility delivered X and the client achieved Y.” Newsletters, however, sometimes have first person from Martin (“I just started a podcast…”). Both are acceptable but make it clear – newsletter can have a more personal founder voice, whereas case studies and service pages should sound like the company voice. Still, they shouldn’t conflict. We can say “we” in case studies to mean our team. The key is all marketing content should sound like it’s coming from the **same ethos** – knowledgeable, straightforward, helpful.
- **Language level:** Generally, marketing content may be read by a broader audience including managers and decision-makers (not just practitioners). So keep language accessible – a bit less technical jargon than a pure tech blog, unless you’re sure the piece targets a technical buyer. Explain necessary terms (or use footnotes/pop-ups for definitions if medium allows) so that a CIO reading a case study can follow along with “Azure DevOps collections” mention by context. We might use slightly more formal tone for executive-facing assets (capabilities decks, etc.), but even then, avoid stilted language. We can be professional without being stuffy.
- **Emotional resonance:** Good marketing copy often appeals to emotions or deeper desires (success, relief, confidence, fear of failure, etc.). Use our candid voice to tap into this. For instance, highlight the pain of the status quo (“Does every release feel like a gamble?”) and the relief/benefit our solution provides (“imagine confident releases with no fire-fighting”). Our case studies do this implicitly by showing disastrous “before” and successful “after.” Make sure the emotional undertone remains positive overall – we acknowledge pain points only to show they can be overcome.

In short, marketing content should be **persuasive but honest**, enthusiastic about possibilities, and congruent with the voice readers may have seen in our blogs (so it feels like the same company speaking). Consistency in voice builds trust – a prospect should not feel a jarring difference between a helpful blog post and a salesy brochure. They should feel it’s the same candid expert, just now inviting them to take action.

### Storytelling, Quotes, and Examples in Marketing Content

Marketing content often **relies on storytelling and evidence** to persuade. Use these elements effectively:

- **Case Study Narratives:** Every case study should tell a compelling **story arc** – essentially, _Problem -> Solution -> Results -> Takeaway_. Use narrative techniques:

  - Set the stage with the **Client Context**: who the client is (industry, scale) and what challenge or pain they faced. Keep this succinct but vivid. e.g., “SLB, a global tech company with thousands of engineers, suffered chaos from 27 siloed Azure DevOps instances…”. This draws the reader in and sets stakes.
  - Describe the **Ask or Goal**: what did the client need? This is often a one-liner (“The ask: consolidate and standardize without disrupting work”).
  - The **Solution/Approach**: Here, tell how _we_ addressed it. This is our time to shine in detail – but keep it story-like, not just bullet points of services. Break it into steps or phases if needed (our case studies sometimes use subheadings like “Diagnosis,” “Approach,” “Outcomes”). Use active, energetic verbs (“delivered,” “embedded,” “launched”). Include interesting specifics: e.g., “introduced first-ever Scrum across all levels, the IGP as Product Owner…”. This helps the reader visualize the work done.
  - **Results/Outcomes:** Quantify results if possible (e.g., “new capabilities delivered every Sprint: a mobile app, digitized forms… \[list of outcomes]”). Use bullet points to highlight multiple outcome facts, as seen in Ghana Police case. If outcomes are qualitative (cultural change, improved morale), state them with evidence or quotes (“Even skeptics were converted when they saw X happen…”). The more concrete the better.
  - **Strategic Insight/Takeaway:** Many case studies end with a broader insight or lesson (“Change must be practiced, not preached… They didn’t wait for a perfect plan; Scrum gave them a system to modernize themselves.”). This wraps the story up and subtly suggests how our philosophy made a difference. It also inspires the reader (they get a mini-lesson applicable to their situation).
  - **CTA:** Usually, a case study concludes or is followed by a CTA like “Learn how we can do this for you” or “Contact us for a consultation”.
  - Write the case study like a success story feature in a magazine – it should be factual but read as engaging narrative more than a dry report. Use the client’s name and sector to lend credibility. If possible, incorporate a **client quote**: e.g., a testimonial from a key stakeholder about the impact (“This transformed our delivery… – \[Client Name]”). A short, punchy quote can serve as a highlight (maybe in a sidebar or pull-quote) and gives a personal voice verifying our claims.

- **Quotes/Testimonial usage:** In any marketing asset (website page, flyer, case study), quotes from satisfied clients or recognized experts can be golden. Only use real quotes that we have permission to use. Format them distinctly (italic or quote blocks with attribution by name, title, company). For example: _“NKD Agility didn’t just train us – they changed how we think about work. The productivity boost has been unbelievable.” – Jane Doe, CTO, XYZ Corp._ Such testimonials should be true and specific if possible. They add trust and allow us to brag through someone else’s words.

  - If we lack direct quotes, sometimes we use indirect reported speech in case studies (“Leadership noted the change in culture was ‘night and day’ compared to before.”) but getting actual quotes is preferred.

- **Examples and Use Cases:** Outside of formal case studies, marketing content (like service pages or brochures) should still include mini-examples to ground promises. For instance, a training promo might say, _“Past attendees have successfully launched their first Scrum team within weeks of our APS course.”_ Or a capabilities page might have short case snippets (“Helped a fintech reduce deployment time by 80%”). These serve as proof points. Ensure any statistic or claim is accurate and ideally referenced to a client or study. If we say “Our approach yields X,” back it up with either aggregated data from our history or known industry metrics.

- **Calls-to-action context:** In newsletters or promos, you can use micro-stories to make a point then follow with CTA. E.g., start a training promo email with a brief scenario: “You walk into Sprint Review and stakeholders are disengaged… sound familiar? In our _Applying Professional Scrum_ course, we tackle exactly this challenge.” This technique hooks the reader with a relatable situation, then positions the offering as the solution.

- **Don’t shy from challenges in stories:** Authenticity is key. In case studies, mention the rough spots (“initially, not everyone was on board” or “the first sprint was chaotic, as expected”). This honesty actually strengthens the story because the eventual success feels earned and realistic. It also aligns with our candid voice. Of course, quickly follow up with how we overcame that challenge. The hero’s journey has obstacles – include them if applicable.

- **Length and focus:** Marketing content should be concise where possible. Case studies can be a bit longer (since detailed storytelling is needed; ours might range \~800-1200 words depending on complexity). But training promos, landing pages, etc., benefit from brevity:

  - For example, a training course promo blog or email might be 300-600 words highlighting why the course matters, what’s unique, and a few logistics (date, link).
  - Landing page copy should be broken into sections with headlines and short paragraphs or bullet lists of benefits, so readers can quickly scan.
  - Newsletters combine multiple short pieces; each segment (like a course highlight or news item) should be tight (100-200 words is plenty for a sub-article in a newsletter before linking out or moving on).

Use **visuals in marketing** strategically: Case studies could include before/after graphics or a photo of the client’s environment (with permission), but often text alone suffices. Training promos might include course logos or relevant imagery (like the Scrum.org badge for a Scrum class). Visuals should be high-quality and professional; they often form the first impression in marketing material. If using images of people (like class photos or speaker headshots), ensure everyone is okay with usage and that the images reflect diversity and professionalism.

By weaving real stories, testimonials, and concrete examples into marketing content, we create **emotional and logical appeal** – the reader can both _feel_ the success and _see_ the evidence. This dual impact is key to persuading them that we can deliver similar value for them.

### Acceptable Use of CTAs and Promotional Elements

Marketing content by nature will have **calls-to-action and promotional messaging**. The goal is to make CTAs compelling and clear, without straying from our authentic tone. Guidelines for CTAs and promo language:

- **Be Clear and Direct:** A marketing CTA should leave no ambiguity about what the reader should do next. Use direct verbs: **Contact Us**, **Register Now**, **Download the Case Study**, **Subscribe**, **Learn More**. Given our voice, we can be a bit more conversational in phrasing as long as the action is clear (e.g., “Ready to transform your team? **Let’s talk.**”). The key is to remove friction – one thought, one action. If possible, mention any incentive or urgency (like **“Register by June 1 for a 20% early-bird discount”**).

- **Placement of CTAs:** For most marketing pieces, the CTA comes at the **end** or is persistent in a sidebar or header. Case studies typically conclude with a CTA line or a button. Landing pages might have multiple CTAs (e.g., a “Contact us” button near the top and bottom). In newsletters, each segment may have its own CTA link (like a “Read more” for an article, or “Sign up” for an event). Make sure each CTA is contextually placed – after the value proposition has been explained, present the CTA. Don’t bury CTAs in the middle of text where they might be overlooked; use formatting (buttons, line breaks) to make them stand out.

- **Tone of CTAs in marketing:** Can be more straightforwardly promotional than in resources. It’s acceptable to use phrases like “Limited seats available – **Enroll Today**” or “Don’t miss out on our exclusive offer.” These create urgency. However, ensure any such phrasing aligns with truth (if it’s not actually limited or exclusive, don’t say it). Our honesty principle still applies. Use urgency and scarcity only when real (e.g., a discount deadline, early bird pricing, limited class capacity).

- **Highlight customer benefit in CTA when possible:** Instead of just “Contact Us” or “Register,” sometimes we can hint at benefit: **“Schedule a Free Consultation”** (implies they get expert advice for free), or **“Claim My Spot in APS Course”** (implies an active benefit). This subtle shift can increase conversion by focusing on what they get, not what they give.

- **Visual style:** Use the formatting tools at hand – e.g., bold text or buttons for CTAs. Our platform might allow adding a Markdown or HTML button class. Ensure there is enough contrast and it’s large enough to notice on the page/email. In print or PDF marketing assets, make CTAs obvious (large font phone number or a distinct section “How to Get Started” with contact info).

- **Promotional content within text:** When describing our services or offerings within marketing copy, it’s fine to **tout our strengths** a bit more explicitly (something we avoid in pure educational content). For example: “Our coaches are Scrum.org certified and have over 15 years of experience – you’re learning from the best.” This kind of statement is acceptable in marketing materials as part of the value proposition. Just ensure claims are accurate (don’t embellish credentials or experience). Also, keep tone confident but not arrogant. We highlight expertise and unique selling points humbly: focus on what the client gains from our strengths (e.g., “you get the benefit of our extensive experience” rather than “we are the greatest Agile coaches ever”).

- **Do’s and Don’ts of promotional style:**

  - **Do** emphasize outcomes and value: Use phrases like “Achieve X,” “Improve Y by Z%,” “Save time and money,” etc., derived from either our case results or logical benefits.
  - **Do** include social proof if appropriate: e.g., logos of clients (if we have permission) on a slide or page, brief testimonials as mentioned, or mentioning community stature (“led by a Professional Scrum Trainer and Microsoft MVP” – subtle brag via credential).
  - **Don’t** use false urgency or gimmicks: e.g., blinking text, multiple exclamation points, or extreme claims (“Act NOW!!! This will change your life!”) – that’s not our style.
  - **Don’t** clutter a piece with too many different CTAs: Ideally one primary CTA per piece (or per section in a newsletter). If you give equal weight to “Contact us” and “Download this PDF” and “Follow us on LinkedIn” all in one short doc, the reader will do none. Decide the main action desired and focus on that. Secondary actions can be present but de-emphasized (like social follow icons can appear but are not the main ask).
  - **Don’t** forget contact info: On any marketing asset (print or digital) that might be consumed independently, ensure our website, email, or phone contact is easily findable. E.g., a case study PDF should have a footer or last section “Get in touch: \[email/URL]”. A newsletter should have clear links or buttons to register or contact where relevant.

- **Follow-through:** If the CTA is to something like a landing page or form, the content around that CTA should prepare the reader for what comes next. For example, if a newsletter segment invites them to _“Read the full case study”_, ensure the case study page they land on continues the story smoothly. If it’s _“Sign up for the course”_, ensure the link leads to the course registration with details. This is more about user experience, but as a writer you might collaborate with web/ops to confirm the CTA links deliver what was promised in the copy.

In essence, marketing CTAs should be **compelling invitations** that feel like a natural next step after hearing our story or pitch. By using clear language and echoing the value proposition in the CTA, we increase the likelihood the reader will act.

### Specific Do’s and Don’ts in Marketing Content

**Do’s:**

- **Do use the client’s or audience’s language:** Mirror the words our target audience uses to describe their pain or goals. If marketing to executives, mention outcomes like “ROI, efficiency, risk reduction.” If to Scrum Masters, mention “team morale, velocity, removing impediments.” This shows we understand them.
- **Do highlight measurable results:** Whenever possible, include numbers or specific facts (number of teams trained, % improvements, timeframes). E.g., “Trained 50+ teams across 3 continents” or “Reduced lead time by 60% within six months.” This concreteness makes claims credible.
- **Do ensure consistency of claims:** Cross-check that any data point or statement aligns with other references (e.g., if a case study says “within 4 months” and a slide deck says “6 months” for the same case, fix it). Marketing materials often get reused across contexts; keep a single source of truth for key stats.
- **Do leverage scarcity/urgency authentically:** If a promo is time-limited or space-limited, say so. E.g., “Only 5 seats left” or “Early bird pricing ends Friday” can boost response – but only if true. Be sure to remove or update such statements as reality changes.
- **Do incorporate branding elements:** Use NKD Agility’s branding – not just logos and colors, but also key messages or taglines if we have them. For example, if our motto or tagline is present (“Beyond rigid processes to agility that evolves with you” – or a similar statement), weave that idea in so prospects get a unified brand message across materials.
- **Do A/B test critical marketing copy** (if digital): Try different subject lines in newsletters, different headline phrasing on landing pages, etc., to see what resonates best. While not a content guideline per se, being open to adjusting tone or wording based on audience feedback is part of good marketing writing.
- **Do maintain professionalism:** Our marketing can be friendly, but it should still reflect a high-quality consultancy/training firm. Proper grammar, polished design, and respectful language are a must. For instance, avoid jokes or puns that could be misinterpreted or diminish credibility. Humor can be used (like a witty blog title) but in strictly marketing copy, it’s safer to be straightforward unless the brand deliberately uses humor in campaigns.

**Don’ts:**

- **Don’t overload with information:** A marketing piece isn’t a technical whitepaper. Don’t attempt to explain every aspect of our method or every course detail in the promo itself. Provide enough info to intrigue and then direct them to contact or a detailed page. E.g., a course promo should hit highlights (what it is, who it’s for, top 3 benefits) and then link to the full course outline page.
- **Don’t use negative selling about competitors:** We focus on what we do well, not on bashing others. Avoid phrases that explicitly disparage other consultancies or courses. It’s fine to differentiate (“Unlike one-size-fits-all frameworks, we tailor to your context”), but do so without naming or denigrating others. Keep tone positive about our approach rather than negative about “the other guys.”
- **Don’t include confidential client details:** This reiterates earlier guidance, but in marketing it’s even more sensitive. Case studies need client approval. Don’t publish any proprietary metrics or quotes without clearance. When in doubt, anonymize or aggregate. Also, be cautious of using client logos or names in marketing lists without permission; ensure we have marketing rights in our agreements.
- **Don’t contradict our educational content:** Marketing claims should not oversimplify to the point of contradicting nuance we give in blogs. For example, if our blog says “There’s no guarantee Agile will triple your speed – it’s about value,” don’t put in a brochure “Agile will triple your speed!” Instead, phrase marketing benefits credibly (“deliver faster without compromising quality”). The marketing message should harmonize with our thought leadership to avoid cynicism among discerning readers.
- **Don’t forget a clear value proposition:** Any marketing copy that just lists features (e.g., “2-day training, includes exercises, Scrum.org exam attempt”) without stating the value (“so you can confidently lead Scrum teams to success”) is a missed opportunity. Always connect features to value, as mentioned.
- **Don’t use internal jargon:** Avoid internal terminology or references that an outsider wouldn’t get. For example, don’t mention our internal project code-names or use abbreviations like “APS” without saying “Applying Professional Scrum (APS)” first. Marketing content should stand on its own for someone new to NKD Agility.
- **Don’t mislead or over-promise:** A fundamental ethical line – do not promise results we can’t ensure (“guaranteed 10x productivity” – too hyperbolic). It’s okay to say “we aim to” or “we have achieved X in past engagements,” but don’t guarantee specific outcomes universally. Likewise, ensure any stated credentials or partnerships are current and accurate (e.g., if we say “Microsoft Gold Partner,” make sure we are at time of publishing).

By adhering to these specifics, marketing content will remain **honest, compelling, and representative of our high standards**. This consistency in quality and tone across both educational and marketing content ultimately builds a stronger, more trustworthy brand.

### Structural Guidance for Marketing Content (Case Studies, Promos, Newsletters)

Each marketing content type has its own ideal structure and cadence. Here are guidelines:

**Case Studies (within Resources but marketing in nature):**

- **Length & Structure:** Typically 1 to 2 pages long (500–1000+ words). Use a clear structure with headings:

  - _Client Overview_ (optional short paragraph with one-liner about the client industry/scale if notable).
  - _Challenge_ (or _Problem_): What problem did the client face? 1-2 paragraphs.
  - _Solution_ (or _Our Approach_): What we did. 2-4 paragraphs, possibly broken with subheads if it was a multi-phase solution.
  - _Results_ (or _Outcome_): Quantifiable and qualitative results. Often best as a bullet list of key achievements (for quick scanning) plus a narrative wrap-up.
  - _Conclusion/Insight_: 1 paragraph on the broader lesson or client testimonial.
  - A sidebar or callout box with **Key Metrics** is effective: e.g., “Key Outcomes: 6 months timeline, 800+ teams consolidated, 15% efficiency gain.”

- **Visuals:** If possible, include the client’s logo (if approved) and maybe a relevant graphic (e.g., before/after chart, or a photo from the engagement like a workshop in session – again with permission). Visual elements can make the case study more engaging.
- **Publishing Cadence:** Case studies are usually published when a significant engagement concludes successfully and we have permission to share. Aim to produce a few per year (e.g., 2-4 annually) to cover different industries or service lines. Ensure they are dated or version-controlled; older ones can remain relevant but consider refreshing them every few years or when outcomes improve further.

**Training Promotions (Blogs/Emails/Landing Pages for courses or events):**

- **Structure for a promo announcement (e.g., blog or email):**

  - A catchy **headline**: e.g., “Beyond Training: How Our Mentorship Model Transforms Careers” or a straightforward one: “New Scrum Master Training – July 2025 – _Enroll Now_”.
  - **Hook intro**: 1-2 sentences that hit the pain point or aspiration (“Struggling to apply Scrum effectively? Our upcoming class offers hands-on guidance to turn theory into practice.”).
  - **What’s being offered:** Clearly state the course or event name, date(s), format (online/in-person), and any credential (e.g., “Professional Scrum Master I certification class”). Can be a short paragraph or list.
  - **Value Proposition:** 1-2 paragraphs or a bullet list on what they will learn/gain. For courses, list topics or skills; for a webinar, list key takeaways. Use enticing language (“Master how to…, Learn the secrets of…, Practice with real-world examples…”).
  - **Instructor or host blurb:** If the credibility of the trainer is a selling point (e.g., Martin or another expert), include a line: “Led by Martin Hinshelwood (Scrum.org Trainer with 15+ years experience)…”.
  - **Logistics and CTA:** Dates, how to register (with a hyperlink or button), cost if applicable (or note “Early bird pricing available”), and any deadlines. End with a CTA: “Secure your spot” or “Register now”.
  - Possibly an image of the course flyer or a relevant graphic (Scrum diagram, etc.) to make it visually appealing.

- **Tone:** More straight-to-the-point than a blog; you’re allowed to be a bit more _sales-forward_ since the purpose is clear. Yet, still frame around reader’s benefit (“Advance your career”, “Boost your team’s performance”).
- **Cadence:** Announce each public class or new offering at least once (far enough ahead to drive sign-ups). You might do a sequence: initial announcement, a reminder closer to date, maybe a last-call if seats remain. But avoid spamming; each communication should add something (e.g., an early announcement focuses on content, a reminder might include a testimonial from a past attendee, the last-call emphasizes urgency).

**Newsletters:**

- **Structure:** Newsletters generally have a consistent template:

  - A **greeting or intro** from Martin or the team (could be a brief personal note or a thematic intro for that edition).
  - **Featured Content/Education:** Often we include a short educational piece or thought (like a mini-blog in the newsletter). E.g., in April 2023 newsletter, Martin gave a quick take on applying Scrum and empiricism, followed by a list of “If you…” bullet points hooking readers.
  - **News/Updates sections:** These can be broken into headings like “News: \[Project or Podcast]”, “Upcoming Training Classes”, “What have we been up to?” etc. Under each, provide digestible info:

    - For **training schedule**: we often embed or list upcoming courses, possibly via an automated listing. Ensure a sentence encouraging them to find a class and a link to full schedule or contact (as in the example).
    - For **recent content**: list recent blog posts or videos (our newsletter uses shortcodes to pull these in). If doing manually, list titles as clickable links with maybe one commentary sentence each.
    - For **special announcements**: e.g., new podcast launch, new hire, new service – give each its own sub-section with a bold subheader.
    - **Personal/connective elements**: e.g., “Our Trainers” section listing team members teaching classes, or community highlights, to personalize the newsletter.

  - **Closing & Contact:** Perhaps a closing line thanking the reader, and a footer with company contact info, social links, unsubscribe info, etc.

- **Tone:** Newsletter can be **more casual and personal**. It’s often from Martin’s voice (“my good friend and I started a podcast…”, “Are there any blog posts you’d like me to write?”). This friendly approach is great for engagement. Even so, maintain clarity and keep segments brief; people skim newsletters. Each segment’s first sentence should convey the main point.
- **Length:** Depending on frequency, newsletters can be fairly long if a lot is happening, but try not to overload. Ideally, a newsletter email fits on one or two screenfuls without endless scrolling. If we have too many items, consider focusing on the most important and simply linking out to a news page for others. A good rule: 3-5 main items (not counting automatically pulled lists) per newsletter.
- **Cadence:** Many companies do monthly newsletters. That’s a solid cadence for us if we have enough updates and content flow. If monthly is too much, bi-monthly or quarterly minimum to keep people warm. Consistency is key – e.g., first week of each month, so readers expect it. Align it with content cadence (if we blog monthly, a monthly newsletter can feature that blog, upcoming classes, etc.). Plan newsletters in advance around major campaigns (like before a big training season or after a big event to recap).
- **Do’s for newsletters:** Keep subject lines interesting (not just “Newsletter Issue 5” but something like “NKD Agility April Update – New Podcast & Training Tips”). Use imagery sparingly (some logos or thumbnails) to avoid heavy emails. Always test the email for formatting (links, mobile responsiveness).
- **Don’ts for newsletters:** Don’t make it purely promotional – always mix in some useful insight or free content so it’s not just an ad. Don’t let the format get too stale – refresh sections if needed for variety (one month include a quick Q\&A with an expert, another month include a short case study snippet, etc., to keep readers engaged).

**Other Marketing Assets (briefly):**

- **Landing/Capability Pages:** Should follow web best practices – strong headline, subheads for sections like “Challenges We Solve,” “Our Approach,” “Success Stories,” and obvious CTAs (contact form or button) persistent. Keep paragraphs short and use visuals/icons for key points.
- **Social Media Posts (if relevant):** While not a focus here, ensure any social blurbs maintain our voice (e.g., when sharing a case study on LinkedIn, include a candid insight from it, not just “Check out our case study”).

By designing marketing content structures to fit their purpose and by following a regular cadence, we ensure our promotional communications are **effective and anticipated**, not random or overwhelming. Structure brings clarity; cadence builds trust and expectation.
