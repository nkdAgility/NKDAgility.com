## Operating Models

### Industrial Operating Model

**Definition:** An operating model rooted in Taylorism and scientific management principles, characterized by command-and-control structures, predictive planning, and output-focused measurement. Assumes work is predictable, repeatable, and best managed through hierarchical authority and detailed upfront planning.

**Characteristics:**

- Command-and-control management structures
- Predictive planning with fixed scope, time, and resources
- Output-focused metrics and deliverables
- Hierarchical decision-making
- Separation of planning from execution
- Emphasis on individual accountability over team collaboration
- Risk mitigation through detailed documentation and sign-offs

**Common terminology (observational, not endorsed):**

- Waterfall
- Milestone
- Project
- Scope
- Deliverable
- Phase gate
- Requirements gathering
- Resource allocation
- Gantt chart
- Change control board

**Why this matters:** Many organizations operate under this model without realizing it. Recognizing these patterns helps identify systemic constraints that prevent true agility.

**See also:** Command-and-Control, Taylorism, Project Operating Model

---

### Product Operating Model

**Definition:** An operating model focused on continuous value delivery, empiricism, and outcome-based measurement. Organized around persistent cross-functional teams aligned to products or value streams, with decision-making authority distributed to those closest to the work.

**Characteristics:**

- Outcome-focused measurement (value delivered, customer impact)
- Empirical process control (transparency, inspection, adaptation)
- Cross-functional, persistent teams
- Continuous delivery and incremental improvement
- Customer-centric decision-making
- Collaborative, distributed authority
- Fast feedback loops and learning cycles
- Technical excellence and engineering practices

**Core principles:**

- Teams organized by value stream, not function
- Authority to make decisions resides with the team
- Success measured by outcomes, not outputs
- Continuous learning through experimentation
- Psychological safety and trust
- System thinking over local optimization

**Common terminology:**

- Product Goal
- Increment
- Value stream
- Outcome
- Empiricism
- Continuous delivery
- Cross-functional team
- Sprint Goal (in Scrum)
- Service Level Expectation (SLE)
- Flow metrics

**Why this matters:** Transitioning from Industrial to Product Operating Model requires fundamental shifts in structure, culture, measurement, and leadership approach. It's not a simple process change.

**See also:** Empirical Process Control, Cross-Functional Teams, Evidence-Based Management

---

## Philosophy & Ethos

### Agile (Philosophy)

**Required usage:** Agile is a **philosophy** grounded in the Agile Manifesto's values and principles.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "Agile methodology"
- ❌ "Agile framework"
- ❌ "Agile process"

**Correct usage examples:**

- ✅ "Adopting an Agile philosophy"
- ✅ "Agile values and principles"
- ✅ "Transitioning to empirical ways of working"

**Why:** Agile is fundamentally about values, principles, and mindset—not prescriptive processes. Calling it a methodology undermines its philosophical foundation.

---

### DevOps (Ethos)

**Required usage:** DevOps is an **ethos** or **culture**, never a role, job title, or tool.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "DevOps engineer"
- ❌ "DevOps team"
- ❌ "DevOps tool"
- ❌ "DevOps role"

**Correct usage examples:**

- ✅ "Adopting a DevOps ethos"
- ✅ "DevOps culture"
- ✅ "DevOps practices and principles"
- ✅ "Engineers practicing DevOps principles"
- ✅ "Tools that enable DevOps practices"

**Core DevOps principles:**

- Continuous Integration (Kent Beck)
- Continuous Delivery (Jez Humble & David Farley)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated testing
- Monitoring & observability
- Security as code
- Collaboration between development and operations

**Why:** DevOps represents a cultural shift in how organizations deliver software. Reducing it to a role or tool misses the point entirely and creates siloed "DevOps teams" that contradict the ethos.

---

### Ethos vs Mindset

**Required usage:** Use **ethos** to describe shared values, beliefs, and cultural characteristics.

**Forbidden alternative:**

- ❌ "Mindset" (implies individual psychology rather than collective culture)

**Correct usage examples:**

- ✅ "An empirical ethos"
- ✅ "The ethos of continuous improvement"
- ✅ "A product-focused ethos"

**Why:** "Ethos" captures the collective, cultural nature of organizational change. "Mindset" is individualistic and psychological, suggesting the problem is in people's heads rather than systemic culture.

---

## Frameworks & Strategies

### Scrum (Social Technology)

**Required usage:** Scrum is a **social technology** and **framework**, not a methodology or process.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "Scrum methodology"
- ❌ "Scrum process"

**Correct usage examples:**

- ✅ "Scrum as a social technology"
- ✅ "The Scrum framework"
- ✅ "Scrum's empirical foundation"

**Key characteristics:**

- Based on empirical process control
- Defines roles, events, artifacts, and commitments
- Lightweight and intentionally incomplete
- Requires adaptation to context

**Scrum is not:**

- A project management methodology
- A prescriptive process
- Complete (intentionally—teams adapt it)

**References:** Ken Schwaber (creator), Nigel Thurlow (Scrum as social technology)

**Why:** Scrum creates structures for human collaboration and learning. It's fundamentally social and empirical, not mechanistic.

---

### Kanban (Strategy & Observability Pattern)

**Required usage:** Kanban is a **strategy** for service delivery and an **observability pattern**, not a methodology.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "Kanban methodology"
- ❌ "Kanban framework"

**Correct usage examples:**

- ✅ "The Kanban strategy"
- ✅ "Kanban as an observability pattern"
- ✅ "Kanban's evolutionary approach"

**Core elements:**

- Visualize workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage flow
- Make policies explicit
- Implement feedback loops
- Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally

**Why:** Kanban is strategic and evolutionary—it helps you see and improve your system. It's not a prescriptive methodology.

---

## Roles & Accountability

### Scrum Master

**Required usage:** Scrum Master is a **system steward** and **servant-leader**, fluent in DevOps and modern engineering practices.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "Facilitator" (too passive)
- ❌ "Team coordinator"
- ❌ "Project manager"
- ❌ "Scrum police"

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ System steward who removes impediments and improves the system
- ✅ Servant-leader focused on team effectiveness
- ✅ Coach for empiricism and Scrum principles
- ✅ Advocate for technical excellence and DevOps practices

**Responsibilities:**

- Facilitate Scrum events
- Coach team on self-management
- Remove systemic impediments
- Advocate for technical excellence
- Guide organizational change
- Protect team from external interference

**Why:** The Scrum Master shapes the system for team success. They're not passive facilitators—they're active system designers who understand both human dynamics and technical practices.

**See also:** Servant Leadership, System Thinking

---

### Product Owner

**Required usage:** Product Owner is a **strategist** and **value maximiser**, not a backlog administrator.

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ "Backlog manager"
- ❌ "Requirements gatherer"
- ❌ "Proxy for stakeholders"
- ❌ "Business analyst"

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ Strategist who maximizes value
- ✅ Accountable for Product Goal and Product Backlog
- ✅ Decision-maker with authority over product direction
- ✅ Collaborator who engages stakeholders and team

**Responsibilities:**

- Define and communicate Product Goal
- Order Product Backlog to maximize value
- Ensure transparency of Product Backlog
- Make trade-off decisions
- Engage with stakeholders and customers
- Collaborate with Developers on refinement

**Why:** The Product Owner is a strategic role requiring deep product knowledge, business acumen, and decision-making authority. Reducing them to backlog administration misses their value.

**See also:** Product Goal, Value Maximization

---

## Leadership & Management

### Leadership as System Design

**Required usage:** Leadership is fundamentally about **system design**, not control.

**Core principles:**

- Leaders design the system in which teams operate
- Authority is distributed to those closest to the work
- Leaders remove constraints and impediments
- Focus on creating conditions for success
- Measure and optimize the system, not individuals

**Influenced by:**

- **Peter Drucker** — Management as system design, clarity of purpose, effectiveness over efficiency
- **Andy Grove** — High-output management, leverage, managerial effectiveness
- **Nigel Thurlow** — Flow-based thinking, systems leadership

**Forbidden approaches:**

- ❌ Command-and-control management
- ❌ Individual performance optimization
- ❌ Resource allocation thinking
- ❌ Heroic leadership
- ❌ Micromanagement

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ Leaders as system stewards
- ✅ Servant leadership
- ✅ Creating psychological safety
- ✅ Empowering through constraints and goals
- ✅ Removing organizational impediments

**Why:** In cognitive work, leadership through control fails. Leaders must design systems that enable teams to succeed.

**See also:** System Thinking, Constraints and Goals, Servant Leadership

---

### Taylorism (Anti-Pattern)

**Definition:** Frederick Winslow Taylor's "scientific management" approach—breaking work into small tasks, separating planning from execution, optimizing individual efficiency through standardization and control.

**Why it has no place in cognitive work:**

- Assumes work is repetitive and predictable (it's not)
- Treats people as interchangeable resources
- Separates thinking from doing
- Optimizes for individual efficiency over system effectiveness
- Eliminates worker autonomy and creativity
- Creates management overhead and bottlenecks

**Observable in organizations through:**

- Detailed task breakdowns and assignments
- Separation of "architects" from "implementers"
- Individual utilization metrics
- Time tracking and efficiency measurement
- Standardized processes applied uniformly
- Management approval for decisions
- Focus on following the plan vs responding to learning

**Why we call this out:** Many organizations unknowingly operate under Taylorist assumptions despite adopting "Agile" labels. Recognizing these patterns is the first step to change.

**See also:** Industrial Operating Model, Command-and-Control

---

### Cross-Functional, Persistent Teams (Mandatory)

**Required usage:** Teams must be **cross-functional** and **persistent** to achieve true agility.

**Core principles:**

- All skills needed to deliver value present within the team
- Teams stay together over time (not project-based)
- Teams own outcomes, not just outputs
- Collective ownership and accountability
- Self-managing within constraints

**Forbidden alternatives:**

- ❌ Resource pools
- ❌ Project-based teams
- ❌ Functional silos
- ❌ Component teams (without product ownership)

**Why mandatory:**

- Eliminates handoffs and dependencies
- Builds collective knowledge and capability
- Enables fast feedback and learning
- Creates psychological safety and trust
- Allows team to optimize delivery system

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ "Persistent product teams"
- ✅ "Cross-functional teams aligned to value streams"
- ✅ "Self-managing teams with end-to-end capability"

**See also:** Product Operating Model, Team Topologies

---

### Managers as System Stewards

**Required framing:** Managers act as **system stewards**, not taskmasters or controllers.

**Responsibilities:**

- Design and improve the system of work
- Remove organizational impediments
- Provide clarity of purpose and constraints
- Enable team autonomy and decision-making
- Measure and optimize system performance
- Create conditions for psychological safety
- Connect teams to organizational strategy

**Not responsible for:**

- ❌ Assigning tasks to individuals
- ❌ Approving every decision
- ❌ Managing individual performance
- ❌ Controlling how work gets done
- ❌ Optimizing resource utilization

**Influenced by:**

- Andy Grove's high-output management
- Peter Drucker's management by objectives
- Systems thinking and Lean principles

**Why:** In knowledge work, managers who try to control the work become bottlenecks. Managers who improve the system enable exponential improvement.

**See also:** Leadership as System Design, Servant Leadership

---

## Empowerment & Constraints

### Empowerment Through Constraints and Goals

**Core principle:** True empowerment comes from **clear constraints and goals**, not unlimited freedom.

**Key elements:**

- **Product Goal** — Strategic direction for the product
- **Sprint Goal** — Coherence and focus for the Sprint
- **WIP limits** — Constraints that enable flow
- **Definition of Done** — Quality agreements
- **Working agreements** — Team norms and policies

**Why this matters:**

- Unlimited autonomy leads to chaos and misalignment
- Clear goals provide direction and focus
- Constraints enable creativity within boundaries
- Agreements create predictability and trust
- Teams can self-manage effectively within defined boundaries

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ "Empowered through clear goals and constraints"
- ✅ "Autonomy within boundaries"
- ✅ "Freedom to decide how, clarity on what and why"

**Forbidden approaches:**

- ❌ "Do whatever you want" (false autonomy)
- ❌ Prescribing solutions or methods
- ❌ Unlimited work in progress
- ❌ Vague or missing goals

**See also:** Product Goal, Sprint Goal, Self-Management

---

## Metrics & Measurement

### Evidence-Based Management (EBM)

**Required approach:** All metrics must align with **Evidence-Based Management** principles and key value areas.

**Four key value areas:**

1. **Current Value (CV)** — Value delivered to customers today
2. **Unrealized Value (UV)** — Potential future value (gap analysis)
3. **Time to Market (T2M)** — Ability to deliver new value quickly
4. **Ability to Innovate (A2I)** — Capability to create new value

**Why EBM:**

- Focuses on outcomes and value, not outputs
- Provides leading and lagging indicators
- Enables empirical decision-making
- Aligns teams to value delivery
- Prevents gaming and dysfunction

**See also:** Forbidden Metrics, Outcome vs Output

---

### Forbidden Metrics (Behaviour-Distorting)

**Never promote or use these metrics:**

#### ❌ Velocity

- **Why forbidden:** Becomes a target, gets gamed, varies by team, not comparable
- **The problem:** Teams inflate estimates, focus on speed over value, creates false predictability
- **Use instead:** Throughput, cycle time, flow metrics

#### ❌ Utilization

- **Why forbidden:** Optimizing utilization kills flow, creates bottlenecks, prevents learning time
- **The problem:** 100% utilization = 0% capacity for unplanned work, improvement, or learning
- **Use instead:** Flow efficiency, lead time, queue depth

#### ❌ Estimates vs Actuals

- **Why forbidden:** Punishes learning, encourages sandbagging, assumes predictability
- **The problem:** Treats estimates as commitments, ignores complexity and discovery
- **Use instead:** Cycle time distribution, predictability through empiricism

#### ❌ Story Points as Productivity Measure

- **Why forbidden:** Relative sizing tool, not productivity metric, easily gamed
- **The problem:** Becomes currency for comparison, inflates over time, focuses on output
- **Use instead:** Value delivered, customer satisfaction, throughput

#### ❌ Individual Performance Metrics

- **Why forbidden:** Destroys collaboration, optimizes locally, creates competition
- **The problem:** Teams must optimize collectively; individual metrics break team dynamics
- **Use instead:** Team outcomes, collective ownership, peer feedback

**General principle:** If a metric can be gamed, it will be. Measure outcomes, not outputs. Use metrics to learn, not to judge.

**See also:** Evidence-Based Management, Outcome vs Output

---

### Outcome vs Output

**Critical distinction:**

**Output** — What you produce or deliver

- Features built
- Story points completed
- Hours worked
- Lines of code
- Releases shipped

**Outcome** — The impact and value created

- Customer satisfaction
- Business value delivered
- Problem solved
- Behavior changed
- Goal achieved

**Required usage:** Always focus on **outcomes**, not outputs.

**Why this matters:**

- You can deliver lots of output with zero outcome (waste)
- Outcome focus drives value and learning
- Output focus drives busyness and feature factories

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ "What outcome are we trying to achieve?"
- ✅ "How will we measure success?" (outcome-based)
- ✅ "What value does this create?"

**Forbidden framing:**

- ❌ "How many features can we deliver?"
- ❌ "Did we complete all the story points?"
- ❌ "We shipped 20 features this quarter" (without outcome context)

**Assignment design:** Assignments should be **outcome-focused**, not output-focused. Example:

- ❌ Output-focused: "Create a Definition of Done document"
- ✅ Outcome-focused: "Establish shared quality standards that prevent defects from reaching production"

**See also:** Evidence-Based Management, Value Maximization

---

## Empiricism & Process Control

### Empirical Process Control

**Definition:** Process control based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—learning through experimentation rather than following a predetermined plan.

**Three pillars:**

1. **Transparency** — Make work visible, create shared understanding
2. **Inspection** — Frequently examine artifacts and progress toward goals
3. **Adaptation** — Adjust process or product based on learnings

**Why it matters:**

- Complex work is inherently unpredictable
- You cannot plan your way to success
- Learning and adaptation are essential
- Transparency enables informed decisions

**Contrast with defined process control:**

- Defined process: Plan → Execute → Control variance
- Empirical process: Hypothesize → Experiment → Inspect → Adapt

**Where you see it:**

- Scrum's inspect-and-adapt cycles
- Kanban's feedback loops
- DevOps's continuous improvement
- Scientific method

**Correct usage:**

- ✅ "Scrum is based on empirical process control"
- ✅ "Empiricism requires transparency"
- ✅ "Inspect and adapt based on evidence"

**See also:** Scrum, Transparency, Adaptation

---

### Transparency

**Definition:** Making the process and work visible to those doing the work and those receiving the work.

**Why mandatory:**

- Cannot inspect what you cannot see
- Enables informed decisions
- Builds trust
- Surfaces problems early
- Enables collaboration

**What must be transparent:**

- Progress toward goals
- Quality of work (Definition of Done)
- Impediments and risks

- Clear definitions and agreements
- Open communication
- Accessible information
- Regular inspection opportunities

**See also:** Empirical Process Control, Definition of Done

---

## DevOps Principles & Practices

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**Origin:** Kent Beck (Extreme Programming)

**Core practices:**

- Integrate code multiple times per day
- Automated build on every commit
- Automated test suite runs with every build
- Fix broken builds immediately
- Maintain a single source repository
- Keep the build fast

**Why essential:**

- Reduces integration risk
- Surfaces conflicts early
- Enables fast feedback
- Foundation for Continuous Delivery
- Required for true agility

**Common misconceptions:**

- ❌ CI is a tool (Jenkins, Azure DevOps)
- ❌ Daily builds = CI
- ❌ CI is only for developers

**Correct framing:**

- ✅ CI is a practice requiring discipline
- ✅ Tools enable CI, they aren't CI
- ✅ Whole team benefits from CI

**See also:** Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Technical Excellence

---

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Definition:** The practice of keeping software in a releasable state throughout its lifecycle, enabling safe, rapid, and sustainable release to production.

**Origin:** Jez Humble & David Farley (_Continuous Delivery_, 2010)

**Core capabilities:**

- Automated deployment pipeline

- Frequent releases to production

**Why essential:**

- Reduces time to market
- Lowers risk of release
- Enables fast feedback from customers
- Creates cadence and predictability
- Foundation of Product Operating Model

**Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment:**

- **Continuous Delivery:** Always ready to deploy (business decides when)
- **Continuous Deployment:** Every change automatically deployed to production

**See also:** Continuous Integration, DevOps, Definition of Done

---

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Definition:** Managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes.

**Core principles:**

- Infrastructure defined in version control

- Testable infrastructure changes

**Why essential:**

- Eliminates configuration drift
- Enables repeatable deployments
- Reduces human error
- Enables rapid scaling
- Documents infrastructure as code

**See also:** DevOps, Automation, Continuous Delivery

---

### Automated Testing

**Definition:** Programmatically validating software behavior at multiple levels to ensure quality and enable confidence in changes.

**Testing pyramid:**

1. **Unit tests** (many, fast, isolated)
2. **Integration tests** (fewer, test component interaction)
3. **End-to-end tests** (few, test critical user paths)

**Why essential:**

- Enables safe refactoring
- Provides fast feedback on changes
- Documents expected behavior
- Reduces manual testing burden
- Foundation for CI/CD

**Required mindset:**

- Tests are not optional
- Tests are first-class code
- Developers write tests
- Broken tests stop everything

**See also:** Technical Excellence, Definition of Done, CI/CD

---

### Monitoring & Observability

**Definition:** Continuously collecting, analyzing, and acting on data about system behavior and performance.

**Monitoring:** Know when something is wrong (alerts, dashboards)

**Observability:** Understand why something is wrong (logs, traces, metrics)

**Why essential:**

- Detect problems before customers do
- Enable data-driven decisions
- Support continuous improvement
- Provide transparency into system health
- Enable faster incident response

**Key practices:**

- Automated alerting
- Distributed tracing
- Log aggregation
- Performance metrics
- Real user monitoring

**See also:** Transparency, Empiricism, DevOps

---

### Security as Code

**Definition:** Integrating security practices and controls directly into the development and deployment pipeline.

**Core practices:**

- Automated security scanning
- Vulnerability management in pipeline
- Security testing automated
- Compliance as code
- Threat modeling in design

**Why essential:**

- Security cannot be an afterthought
- Manual security reviews are bottlenecks
- Faster feedback on security issues
- Reduces risk of breaches
- Enables compliance at speed

**See also:** DevOps, Automation, Shift-Left

---

## Scrum Artifacts & Commitments

### Product Goal

**Definition:** The long-term objective for the product. Describes a future state of the product that serves as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.

**Commitment for:** Product Backlog

**Why it matters:**

- Provides strategic direction
- Enables coherent Product Backlog
- Aligns stakeholders

**See also:** Product Owner, Product Backlog, Sprint Goal

---

### Sprint Goal

**Definition:** The single objective for the Sprint that provides coherence and focus.

**Commitment for:** Sprint Backlog

**Why it matters:**

- Creates focus and coherence
- Enables flexibility in implementation
- Provides basis for collaboration
- Guides trade-off decisions
- Foundation for empiricism in Sprint

**Characteristics of good Sprint Goals:**

- Single, clear objective
- Achievable in Sprint timeframe
- Valuable to stakeholders
- Provides flexibility in how
- Team can commit to it

**Common dysfunction:**

- No Sprint Goal (just a list of items)
- Multiple unrelated goals
- Goal is just "complete these items"
- Goal set without team input

**See also:** Sprint Planning, Empiricism, Focus

---

### Definition of Done (DoD)

**Definition:** Shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, ensuring transparency and quality.

**Commitment for:** Increment

**Why mandatory:**

- Creates transparency of quality
- Prevents technical debt
- Enables predictability
- Required for "Done" Increment
- Foundation for trust

**What good DoD includes:**

- All code reviewed
- All tests passed (unit, integration, automated)
- Documentation updated
- Security scanned
- Deployed to staging
- Acceptance criteria met
- No known defects

**Evolution:**

- Teams start with achievable DoD
- Incrementally strengthen over time
- Organization may have baseline DoD
- Team can exceed, never lower, org DoD

**See also:** Technical Excellence, Transparency, Increment

---

## Terminology Corrections

### "Agile Transformation"

**Forbidden:** ❌ "Agile transformation"

**Use instead:**

- ✅ "Transition to empirical ways of working"
- ✅ "Organizational evolution toward agility"
- ✅ "Adopting an Agile philosophy"

**Why:** "Transformation" implies a one-time change with an end state. Agility is a continuous journey of adaptation and improvement. Also, you don't "transform to Agile"—you adopt Agile philosophy and practices.

---

### "Resources" for People

**Forbidden:** ❌ "Resources" when referring to people

**Use instead:**

- ✅ Team members
- ✅ People
- ✅ Individuals
- ✅ Developers (in Scrum context)
- ✅ Engineers, practitioners, specialists

**Why:** People are not fungible resources. Calling them "resources" reflects Industrial Operating Model thinking and dehumanizes individuals.

---

### "Delivering Sprints"

**Forbidden:** ❌ "Deliver a Sprint" or "Sprint delivery"

**Use instead:**

- ✅ "Deliver an Increment"
- ✅ "Complete a Sprint"
- ✅ "Deliver value during the Sprint"

**Why:** Sprints are containers for work, not deliverables. Teams deliver Increments that provide value.

---

### Role Capitalization

**Required:** Capitalize formal Scrum roles, events, and artifacts when referring to Scrum framework elements.

**Correct:**

- ✅ Scrum Master (role in Scrum)
- ✅ Product Owner (role in Scrum)
- ✅ Developers (role in Scrum)
- ✅ Sprint Planning (event in Scrum)
- ✅ Sprint Review (event in Scrum)
- ✅ Sprint Retrospective (event in Scrum)
- ✅ Daily Scrum (event in Scrum)
- ✅ Product Backlog (artifact in Scrum)
- ✅ Sprint Backlog (artifact in Scrum)
- ✅ Increment (artifact in Scrum)
- ✅ Definition of Done

**But lowercase when generic:**

- ✅ "She's a product owner" (general role)
- ✅ "Daily standup meeting" (generic practice, not Scrum's Daily Scrum)

**Why:** Proper capitalization distinguishes Scrum's specific framework elements from general industry terms.

---
