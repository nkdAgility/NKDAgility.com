  "penalty_details": "Intent dimension penalized (-1 point) due to critical tone directly undermining the conceptual framing of Scrum Values as primarily behaviour and mindset-oriented.",
  "reasoning": "The content strongly emphasizes Agile as an engineering discipline, placing minimal value on behavioral dimensions typically associated with Scrum Values such as Openness, Commitment, Respect, Courage, and Focus. The author directly challenges the idea of Agile as primarily behavioural or mindset-driven, explicitly stating that Agile behaviours like openness and collaboration are mere by-products of strong systems, not central principles themselves. There are indirect mentions of collaboration and openness as necessary conditions (aligns weakly with Scrum Values), but these aspects are quickly downplayed as less essential than technical systems and practices. The direct mentions of Scrum Values themselves are practically nonexistent; values like commitment, respect, and courage are completely absent. The conceptual alignment is thus weak, and depth of discussion focusing explicitly on Scrum Values is also very minimal, as emphasis is instead placed heavily on technical engineering practices. The author's intent specifically refutes and actively contradicts the "Agile/Scrum as mindset or values" framing, hence a penalty is appropriately applied. Audience alignment remains moderate given overlapping practitioners and coaches, but focus on engineering roles diminishes full overlap. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate due to coherent arguments but with little relevance specific to Scrum Values.",
  "reasoning_summary": "The content actively rejects Agile as mindset or behaviour-centred, providing little alignment or depth regarding Scrum Values. Its primary focus is engineering practices rather than value-driven interactions or principles central to Scrum."
