Our Professional Agile Leadership- Essentials course helps leaders understand how to best support their Agile teams and is ideal preparation for PAL-EBM, but is not a prerequisite. Our Professional Scrum Product Owner and Professional Scrum Product Owner - Advanced courses teach Product Owners how to deliver value and can be a great complement to the PAL-EBM course",

      "introduction": "In this 14h, delivered over four half-days, students will gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of their organization. Through a case study-based series of exercises, combined with instruction, students gain the entrepreneurial product leadership skills and practices critical to growing as a successful Product Owner. The Product Owner role is multifaceted, requiring them to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum framework. Students explore these techniques and how to pivot among them by exploring several Product Owner \"stances\" including: \n- The Customer Representative:\n    - Focus on understanding customer problems, pains and opportunities\n    - Get into the mindset of the customer, placing yourself in their world, understanding their needs\n    - Deliver value by connecting product features to customer outcomes\n- The Visionary:\n    - Champion the future state, possibilities, goals and chances\n    - Communicate the product vision, strategy and Product Goal\n    - Understand value and pricing models\n- The Experimenter:\n    - Focus on innovation through experiments, hypotheses, tests, learnings, data and validation of value\n    - Understand the Product Owner’s role in a scaled environment\n- The Decision Maker:\n    - Focus on making better decisions\n    - Navigate conflicting customer feedback\n- The Collaborator:\n    - Seek collaboration with stakeholders and the Scrum Team\n    - Work beyond the Scrum Team including contracts, finance, budgeting and governance in an agile way\n- The Influencer:\n    - Lead the stakeholders, customers and Scrum Team, to move in the right direction and to change their minds, when necessary\n    - Learn how to create a stakeholder management strategy\n\n\n[View](https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-training-competency-mapping \"Professional Scrum Training Competency Mapping\") the different Focus Areas covered within this class and others.\n",
