      "introduction": "Welcome to the Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) course. This transformative learning journey is designed specifically for Product Owners, Leaders, Entrepreneurs, and Managers eager to deeply understand and incorporate Scrum values and principles into their work. The course offers practical case studies and engaging exercises to ensure a hands-on learning experience.\n\nIn the ever-evolving product landscape, a thorough understanding of Scrum is not just beneficial but essential for modern teams. Scrum practices equip organizations with the agility, responsiveness, and efficiency needed to thrive amidst changing market dynamics.\n",
      "overview": "There are many myths and misconceptions about the role of the Product Owner.

Students learn techniques that they can use to help them overcome the challenges that are often encountered on a day-to-day basis. They will do this while learning better ways to collaborate and engage with the users and customers, stakeholders, their team(s) and organization to provide greater value in the product being delivered.\n\nView the different Focus Areas covered within this class and others.\n\n*  When offered in-person, this course is generally delivered over two consecutive days. When offered as a Live Virtual Class, the course may be broken up into more, shorter days.\n",
      "outcomes": "When a student leaves the classroom they will have improved skills to impact their products and organizations by: \n\n- Improving value created by staying focused on value and outcomes\n- Increasing organizational learning validating sooner rather than later which will also reduce costs\n- Achieving better business outcomes by aligning initiatives with business strategy through shared vision and aligning people toward clear goals\n- Increasing business agility by being data informed and empirical\n",
      "objectives": "- Increase business agility through proper execution of the Product Owner role.\n- Adopt a product mindset over a traditional project-based approach.\n- Bridge business strategy to product execution using Scrum.\n- Understand the Product Owner as an Agile Product Manager.\n- Master the core principles of Scrum and Empiricism.\n- Define and execute the Product Owner accountabilities within the Scrum Team.\n- Align teams around the business strategy, product vision, and goals.\n- Communicate the business strategy, product vision, and goals effectively.\n- Manage Product Backlog, release management, and forecasting.\n- Track value creation with meaningful metrics.\n- Engage stakeholders, customers, and team members effectively.\n",
