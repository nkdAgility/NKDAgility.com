    The current track record of agile transformations is not very promising. 75% of all agile transformations fail to achieve their goals and therefore missing out on the huge positive impact it has on employee engagement, customer satisfaction, operational performance and time-to-market (McKinsey 2022). Is it because companies see Agile as a business process update and not as a cultural shift?

    Is Business Agility a huge buzzword in your organization, which is difficult to break down into digestible pieces? Or, are your existing agile teams looking for new ways of triggering organizational change or looking for a new way of working? The list of challenges can be long.

    On a team-level, the Agile Kata can infuse new energy and ideas to existing agile teams that are looking to improve their existing agile process. Some teams, that are looking for alternatives to Scrum or Kanban, can use the Agile Kata also as their team process.

    The Agile Kata is versatile and can provide answers to these common questions and challenges. It combines a proven practice, which has been applied for decades in lean manufacturing, with a clear alignment to agile values and principles. See how scientific thinking and practical hands-on application work well together in this 1-day course. Walk away with an understanding that the Agile Kata is not an off-the-shelf process product, but a pattern that helps you create your own process, specific to your organizational needs and goals.

    In this one day class, students are challenged to explore the Agile Kata pattern so they can better understand what to do when applying the Agile Kata to support their teams and organizations.

    The course, uses a combination of instructor-led and activity-based learning where students work together in pairs or small teams. The certified Agile Kata trainer bring their own experiences and stories to the class and use their skills and knowledge to deliver the material using their own unique delivery style. The result is an engaging, enjoyable learning experience where students gain a deep understanding of the Agile Kata pattern and how it can be applied by an entire agile team or organization.

    Students leave this course with an appreciation for the use of the Agile Kata and a starting point for their own professional journey using the Agile Kata. When offered in-person, this course is generally delivered in one full day. When offered as a live instructor-led online course,, it may be broken up into more, shorter segments.

      ### **Why is the Product Backlog so important?**
       In the context of our 'Professional Scrum Product Backlog Mastery' course, understanding the Product Backlog's significance is paramount. The Product Backlog, a vital tool in Agile product development, is a dynamic inventory representing all that a product necessitates. As we traverse the intricate terrains of product development, there's a common inclination to structure the Product Backlog in a hierarchical manner, akin to the familiar Initiative-&gt;Epic-&gt;Feature-&gt;User Story-&gt;Task/Bug framework. However, it's essential to critically assess the implications of such a hierarchy, especially given the complexities inherent in product development environments.  The allure of a structured hierarchy, reminiscent of traditional project management approaches like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), might seem appealing. Yet, in the Agile realm, this could introduce rigidity and diminish the Backlog's transparency. Instead of a cluttered hierarchy, consider a streamlined approach that encapsulates only the work pertinent to the team, supplemented with tags or wikis for context. This approach not only enhances clarity but also empowers teams to structure the Backlog in a manner that resonates with them, fostering adaptability in complex product development scenarios. The strategy should inform, not dictate, the Product Backlog's organisation, recognising that those closest to the work often possess the most profound insights. In essence, the course emphasises the balance between strategic alignment and team autonomy, aiming to cultivate a resilient ecosystem that thrives amidst the uncertainties of complex product development. So, what truly lies within your backlog? 
      ### **Why is backlog management so important?**
       In the context of our 'Professional Scrum Product Backlog Mastery' course, understanding and mastering the art of Product Backlog management is pivotal. Just as a sculptor meticulously carves a statue, in the world of Scrum, the Product Backlog must be carefully curated to reflect the product's unrealised potential. It's a dynamic entity that should be transparent and comprehensible to all involved. However, it's essential to avoid an overly extensive backlog that becomes cumbersome for the team.  The essence of a Product Backlog lies in its balance: it should be concise yet comprehensive. While it's crucial to maintain a streamlined backlog, foresight is equally important. Product development operates in a fluid environment, and the ability to anticipate future needs while avoiding over-planning is a skill in itself. This course will guide you in finding that optimal balance. Surprises are part and parcel of product development, but distinguishing between genuine unknowns and mere oversights is vital. Regular reflections on past work, understanding surprises, and strategising for the future are integral components of effective backlog management. Remember, the Product Backlog is an evolving tool, and as product managers, we shape its evolution. The goal? A Product Backlog that's lean, insightful, and perfectly aligned with stakeholder ROI.
    overview: If you're a Product Owner keen on honing your skills, or perhaps a Scrum Master aiming to support your Product Owners better, this course is for you. Product Managers and Business Analysts eager to elevate their Product Backlog management skills will also find immense value here.
