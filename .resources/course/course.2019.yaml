    introduction: |
      Welcome to the Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) course. This transformative learning journey is designed specifically for Product Owners, Leaders, Entrepreneurs, and Managers eager to deeply understand and incorporate Scrum values and principles into their work. The course offers practical case studies and engaging exercises to ensure a hands-on learning experience.

      In the ever-evolving product landscape, a thorough understanding of Scrum is not just beneficial but essential for modern teams. Scrum practices equip organizations with the agility, responsiveness, and efficiency needed to thrive amidst changing market dynamics.
    overview: |
      There are many myths and misconceptions about the role of the Product Owner. The accountabilities of the Product Owner, however, go well beyond managing the Product Backlog and writing User Stories. The Product Owner is pivotal to bridging business strategy and product execution in order to help the organization create valuable products.

      In this two day class* students will develop and solidify their knowledge of the Scrum framework and the accountabilities of being a Product Owner through instruction and team-based exercises. Students learn techniques that they can use to help them overcome the challenges that are often encountered on a day-to-day basis. They will do this while learning better ways to collaborate and engage with the users and customers, stakeholders, their team(s) and organization to provide greater value in the product being delivered.

      View the different Focus Areas covered within this class and others.

      *  When offered in-person, this course is generally delivered over two consecutive days. When offered as a Live Virtual Class, the course may be broken up into more, shorter days.

          - Define an experiment to meet your stakeholders need in an more empirical way and get approval from your stakeholders to run it.
          - Calculate flow-based forecasts for historic data you have gathered and compare it with your current forecasting approach and the real data. Present the results to your stakeholders to initiate a discussion on various forecasting approaches.
          - Evaluate time investment in forecasting and initiate a discussion with your stakeholders what would change if you would stop this investment completely.
          - Discuss with your Scrum Team(s) how much undone work and technical debt your product is currently holding and how much this impacts transparency. Run one experiment to increase transparency.
          - Run an experiment on communicating a bandwidth for a forecast instead of a specific deadline and degrees of certainty to your stakeholders.
          - Run an experiment to forecast a goal instead of the work to be done. 
          - Visualize your workflow around delivering valuable work and discuss it with your Scrum Team(s) and stakeholders.
          - Run an experiment to identify the smallest possible functionality to gather feedback instead of planning to build the full functionality.
          - Run an experiment to validate the value delivered with a release and compare it to expectations.
          - Discuss ways with your Scrum Team(s) and stakeholders to reduce your release cadence and get approval to run a specific experiment to shorten cycle time.

    overview: |2+

      - Scrum Masters and Product Owners will learn how to integrate the UX speciality with what they already know about the power of self-organizing cross-functional teams. This will enable them to help Developers to learn about the customer, plan learning/discovery/design work, and still deliver a "Done" increment each Sprint. In addition, Scrum Masters will learn how to incorporate product discovery techniques into Sprints and how to balance the product discovery work with the product delivery work while Product Owners will learn product discovery techniques that User Experience Designers use to better understand the needs of the user.
      - UX Professionals struggling to integrate on a Scrum Team will learn how to work more effectively inside Scrum, managing work in Sprints and visualizing it in the Product Backlog.
      - People who have learned about Lean UX and want to learn how to integrate those concepts into Professional Scrum working together in a unified Scrum Team.

    ### Should UX be part of the Scrum Team?

    UX/CX plays a critical role in successful product development. Participants explore Professional Scrum and Lean UX through a unique blend of self-paced learning, live classroom hands-on activity-based exercises, and community-based aftercare.

    Throughout the class and between sessions, students leverage Lean UX techniques focusing on the core design and research activities that illustrate how they come together with development and delivery. Attendees explore how these activities fit into a dual-track agile process (Design and Development) where cross-functional teams can work together to explore, experiment and deliver value-based outcomes.

    After the class, they get to connect with peers and thought leaders to empirically and incrementally develop their skills in collaborative Lean UX.

    The course also includes a complimentary attempt at the globally recognized Professional Scrum with UX I (PSU I) certification exam.

    View the different [Focus Areas](https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-training-competency-mapping) covered within this class and others.

    _This course is generally delivered over two consecutive days when offered in person. However, when offered as a Live Virtual Class, the course may be broken up into more, shorter days._

The Scrum Master role is complex and often, a Scrum Master must be able to apply different stances in order to be effective, such as:  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
      - The Scrum Master as a Teacher
      - The Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor
      - The Scrum Master as a Facilitator
      - The Scrum Master as a Change Agent

      <!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  As a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  As a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent.  Throughout the class, Martin will provide stories, exercises, facilitation techniques (such as “Liberating Structures”), resources and more.  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  There will also be a time in class for Martin to provide coaching on challenges that you and your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    The Professional Scrum Master II (PSM-A) course is a 2-day advanced Scrum Master class designed to support Scrum Masters in their professional development.  The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized [Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-ii-certification) exam.

    Unlike the [Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master/) which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM-A is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.
