      title: Professional Agile Leadership - Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM)
      content: Scrum.org created the Evidence-Based Management™ (EBM) framework which is an Agile approach to help leaders guide their teams toward continuously improving customer outcomes, organizational capabilities, and business results. EBM focuses on customer value and intentional experimentation to systematically improve an organization’s performance and achieve its strategic goals.
    code: PAL-EBM
    level: advanced
    introduction:
    overview: |-
      PAL-EBM is for professionals in leadership roles (including executives, managers, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, coaches, and consultants) who: 
      - Are responsible for the success of their product delivery programs or Agile transformations and are seeking a means to measure and demonstrate that success
      - Are looking for a framework that identifies improvement areas that increase their business agility, including their time to pivot to meet new challenges and deliver customer value
      - Want to help their organization embrace empiricism and experimentation to find solutions for complex problems (where more is unknown than known or the situation changes rapidly)
      - Want to articulate goals and measures in a way that fosters self-management and empower their teams to understand the connection between their work and the value their organization is providing and customer is receiving
      - Want to be more effective in how they measure success by using Agile measures rather than traditional measurement models (including the use of velocity) Attendees should have read the Evidence-

       Based Management Guide, have an understanding of Agile practices and a desire to move away from traditional, (plan-driven,) ways of working and measurement models, however, they do not need specific experience with Scrum. Our Professional Agile Leadership- Essentials course helps leaders understand how to best support their Agile teams and is ideal preparation for PAL-EBM, but is not a prerequisite. Our Professional Scrum Product Owner and Professional Scrum Product Owner - Advanced courses teach Product Owners how to deliver value and can be a great complement to the PAL-EBM course
    outcomes: |-
      <!-- wp:paragraph -->  In the Professional Agile Leadership™ – Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM) one day\* course, participants learn what EBM is and how to apply it through hands-on, activity-based learning. Through a series of exercises participants learn techniques that support a more agile mindset:  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
      - Use empiricism to set and achieve strategic goals, managing the unknown and complexity through experimentation and by adapting goals along the way
      - Create a cultural environment using clear goals, appropriate measures and trust to enable self-management and autonomy
      - Shift the conversation away from measuring progress purely through team performance metrics, toward a focus on customer-centricity and improving customer outcomes
      - Drive operational improvements by using four Key Value Areas (Unrealized Value, Current Value, Time-to-Market, and the Ability to Innovate) as lenses for evidence-based decision-making

      <!-- /wp:list -->
    assessment:
    objectives: |2+

      - Understand the essential aspects of goals and measures and how they influence behaviors and an organization’s culture and values
      - Help organizations embrace empiricism as a leadership approach. Using experimentation to incrementally steer toward the organization’s goals
      - An appreciation for how goals and trust act together to enable autonomy, transparency, and value delivery
      - Correlate market leadership and sustainability to curiosity, adaptation, and empiricism
      - Understand how to use EBM and its KVAs to focus measurements on improving market value and operational capabilities

    prerequisites: |+
      Course attendees do not need experience or knowledge of Scrum, though a connection to the various aspects of Scrum (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, empiricism) is made. Ideally, the attendees will have familiarity with Agile principles and are proponents of using Agile methods at their organization. For the best outcome of the class I recommended that you read: 
      - Read: [The Evidence-Based Management Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/)
      - Read: [Investing for Business Agility: Using evidence-based portfolio management to achieve better business outcomes](https://nkdagility.com/investing-for-business-agility-using-evidence-based-portfolio-management-to-achieve-better-business-outcomes/)

    [Professional Agile Leadership with Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM)](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-agile-leadership-with-evidence-based-management-pal-ebm-training-experience-with-certification/) training experience uses a unique blend of **self-paced** learning, **live classroom** hands-on activity-based exercises, and **community-based** aftercare. With markets and customer needs constantly changing, organizations need information and evidence that helps them adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities so that they can deliver greater value and achieve true business agility.The course goes beyond the topics explored in the [Professional Agile Leadership Essentials](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-agile-leadership-essentials-pal-e-training-experience-with-certification-helping-leaders-understand-their-role-in-enabling-agile-transformation/)  & [Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO)](https://nkdagility.com/training/scheduled/professional-scrum-product-owner-pspo-experience-on-8th-august-2022-live-virtual-class-over-4-half-days/) classes and deepens participants’ understanding by introducing the four key-value areas and a number of suggested key-value metrics that can help leaders guide their teams toward continuously improving customer outcomes, organizational capabilities, and business results. EBM focuses on customer value and intentional experimentation to systematically improve an organization’s performance and achieve its strategic goals.Students should already have at least one year of product development experience and practical knowledge of Scrum to participate in and benefit from these exercises. Having previously taken the PAL class is recommended but not required.

    - Session 1: **Goals, Measures, & Behaviors**
    - Session 2: **Key-value Areas & Key-value Metrics**

    Each session includes STARTUP activities before and WRAPUP activities to be completed after each session. Before, during, and after the class, students can interact with other students and thought leaders in our Lean-Agile Community.The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognised Professional Agile Leadership - Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM) certification exam.

    Scrum Teams flourish when the Scrum Master and Product Owner accountabilities are well fulfilled. The 3-day Professional Scrum Master and Product Owner (PSMPO) course combines the key learning objectives from both the Scrum.org Professional Scrum Master™ (PSM) and Professional Scrum Product Owner™ (PSPO) courses. Merging PSM and PSPO together enables side-by-side learning in a way that is not possible when Scrum Masters and Product Owners are trained separately. These learners greatly benefit from having a shared understanding for one another and by blending the content, students avoid duplicate foundational content and have more space to focus on learning together. This course includes free attempts at both the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) and Professional Scrum Product Owner I (PSPO I) globally recognized certification exams.

    level: advanced
    introduction: |
      In this 14h, delivered over four half-days, students will gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of their organization. Through a case study-based series of exercises, combined with instruction, students gain the entrepreneurial product leadership skills and practices critical to growing as a successful Product Owner. The Product Owner role is multifaceted, requiring them to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum framework. Students explore these techniques and how to pivot among them by exploring several Product Owner "stances" including: 
      - The Customer Representative:
          - Focus on understanding customer problems, pains and opportunities
          - Get into the mindset of the customer, placing yourself in their world, understanding their needs
          - Deliver value by connecting product features to customer outcomes
      - The Visionary:
          - Champion the future state, possibilities, goals and chances
          - Communicate the product vision, strategy and Product Goal
          - Understand value and pricing models
      - The Experimenter:
          - Focus on innovation through experiments, hypotheses, tests, learnings, data and validation of value
          - Understand the Product Owner’s role in a scaled environment
      - The Decision Maker:
          - Focus on making better decisions
          - Navigate conflicting customer feedback
      - The Collaborator:
          - Seek collaboration with stakeholders and the Scrum Team
          - Work beyond the Scrum Team including contracts, finance, budgeting and governance in an agile way
      - The Influencer:
          - Lead the stakeholders, customers and Scrum Team, to move in the right direction and to change their minds, when necessary
          - Learn how to create a stakeholder management strategy

      This course is designed for Product Owners, Product Managers, and Business Analysts focusing heavily on Product Management skills, tools, techniques, and knowledge as part of their work on the Scrum Team. The course does not address the Scrum framework (much), and we assume people have a proper understanding of the Scrum framework. Participants should have at least one year of experience as a Product Owner or Product Manager, while multiple years of experience and having attended the [Professional Scrum Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-product-owner-pspo-training/ "Professional Scrum Product Owner™ Training") course and passing [PSPO](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-certification "Professional Scrum Product Owner™ I")is preferred, but not mandatory. Other people that might benefit from the PSPO-A course include: 
      - Scrum Masters / Agile Coaches

    Professional Scrum Product Owner™ - Advanced (PSPO-A) training experience uses a unique blend of self-paced learning, live classroom hands-on activity-based exercises, and community-based aftercare helping experienced Product Owners and Product Managers expand their ability to establish a vision, validate their hypotheses, and ultimately deliver more value to their stakeholders. The course goes beyond the topics explored in the [Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO)](https://nkdagility.com/training/scheduled/professional-scrum-product-owner-pspo-experience-on-8th-august-2022-live-virtual-class-over-4-half-days/) class deepening the attendee's understanding of the role by exploring the many stances of a professional Product Owner. Students should have at least one year of Product Owner experience and practical knowledge of Scrum in order to participate in and benefit from these exercises. Having previously taken the PSPO class is recommended but not required.

    - Session 1: The Stances of the Product Owner & The Customer Representative
    - Session 2: The Visionary & The Experimenter
    - Session 3: The Decision Maker & The Collaborator
    - Session 4: The Influencer & Closing

    Each session includes STARTUP activities before the session and WRAPUP activities to be completed after each session. Before, during, and after the class students can interact with other students and thought leaders in our Lean-Agile Community.

    The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognised Professional Scrum Product Owner II (PSPO II) certification exam.
