outcomes: |2-

  1. **Flow Metrics - Core Concepts**: An in-depth exploration of key Flow Metrics including Work in Progress (WIP), Work Item Age, Cycle Time, and Throughput. This section will cover the definitions, significance, and how each metric specifically impacts Scrum processes.
  2. **Application to Scrum Events**: Practical strategies for integrating Flow Metrics into various Scrum events. Detailed guidance on how to use these metrics for enhancing Sprint Planning, optimizing the Daily Scrum, adding value to Sprint Reviews, and making Sprint Retrospectives more effective.
  3. **Flow Analytics Tools and Techniques**: Mastery of tools such as Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFDs), Scatterplots, and Monte Carlo simulations. This topic focuses on how to use these analytical tools to visually represent and analyze data, aiding in better decision-making and process improvement within Scrum.
  4. **Getting Started with Flow Metrics**: A step-by-step guide on initiating Flow Metrics in your Scrum team. This includes practical advice on what data is crucial, effective methods for data collection, and techniques for mining and interpreting this data to enhance Scrum practices.

   This focused approach ensures that participants not only grasp the theoretical aspects of Flow Metrics but also gain hands-on experience in applying these concepts effectively within their Scrum teams.
