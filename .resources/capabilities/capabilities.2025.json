This creates a clear, repeatable path to AI value.\n\n[The Kendall Framework]({{< ref \"/resources/guides/kendall-guide\" >}}) matters because it gives organisations a disciplined, problem-first way to adopt AI that avoids chasing trends and wasted investment. By focusing on real problems, clear context, and measurable outcomes, it ensures AI efforts stay aligned with business goals. Defined roles provide accountability, structured artefacts and events create transparency, and regular inspection fosters continuous learning. The result is AI adoption that is purposeful, trustworthy, and delivers sustained value.\n",
