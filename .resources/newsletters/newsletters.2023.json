Immersion Training offers a refreshing alternative, breaking the class into shorter sessions across several weeks. This format not only extends learning into real-world business applications but also incorporates reflective sessions for [continuous improvement]({{< ref \"/tags/continuous-improvement\" >}}), making it a highly effective and practical approach.\n\n![](images/NKDAgility-Immersive-learning-overview-450x450.png)\n\n- **Incremental Classroom Learning**: In Immersion Training, classes are concise, live sessions spanning several weeks. Each session introduces and practices a new concept, allowing students to digest the material at a comfortable pace and ensuring a deep understanding before moving forward. Sessions are capped at 4 hours to keep learners engaged and to foster an effective learning environment.\n- **Outcome-Based Assignments**: These assignments, tied to each classroom session, are designed to apply the concepts learned directly. They focus on outcomes rather than outputs, catering to various backgrounds and skill levels. The emphasis is on innovation and boundary-pushing, not just completion, making the assignments relevant for both new and seasoned learners.\n- **Facilitated Reflections**: After the initial session, each class starts with a reflection period. Here, students and their [Professional Scrum]({{< ref \"/tags/professional-scrum\" >}}) Trainer discuss the assignments, sharing challenges and successes. These sessions are vital for learning, encouraging peer interaction and actionable feedback, and fostering collective growth and understanding.\n\nStarting in 2024, we will be running immersive classes in bundles as Learning Journeys that you can book together, or\n\n1.

    "BodyContent": "Greetings,\n\nWe hope this message finds you in good spirits and health. As a valued member of our community, we are always looking for ways to enhance your experience and provide you with the utmost value. Today, we are thrilled to share an exciting update that does just that.\n\n**Introducing Our Referral Programme**\n\nWe believe that knowledge is power, and sharing knowledge empowers us all. With this in mind, we have created a Referral Programme that rewards you for spreading the word about our courses.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nEvery participant in each class is given a unique personal code. This code can be used to refer colleagues, friends, or anyone in your professional network to our courses. When someone you refer enrols in a class using your personal code, they will receive a 20% discount on their course fee. As a token of our appreciation, you will also receive a 20% credit towards your future classes.\n\nThe more you refer, the more you save:\n\nIf you refer one person, you get a 20% credit towards your next class. If you refer two people, you get a 40% credit towards your next class. And so on, up to 100% credit, meaning you could potentially pay nothing for a class yourself!\n\nIt’s a win-win situation:\n\nYour referrals get a significant discount on their course fee, and you get a substantial credit towards your future classes. It’s our way of saying thank you for your continued support and for helping us grow our community of professionals.\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\n1. Share your personal code with your colleagues, friends, or anyone in your professional network. _Claim your code at [https://nkdagility.com/become-an-advocate/](https://nkdagility.com/become-an-advocate/)_\n2. Encourage them to enrol in a class and use your personal code at the time of enrolment to receive a 20% discount.\n3. Once they have completed their enrolment, you will automatically receive a 20% credit towards your future classes.\n\nIt’s that simple!\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the trust and support you have shown us over the years. Our Referral Programme is just one way we are giving back to our community. Together, we can empower each other to achieve greater success.\n\nThank you for being a part of our journey.\n\nYours in agile excellence,\n\nMartin Hinshelwood\n\n---\n\n## Upcoming Training Classes\n\nFind a class and location near you, or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you want or want a private class for your organization.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"\\]\n\nFind a class and location near you, or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you want or want a private class for your organization.\n\n#### Our Trainers\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"\\]\n\n## What have we been up to?\n\nA short list of our blogs, videos, and webcasts!\n\n#### Recent Blog Posts\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"blog\" >}}\n\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\n\n#### Recent Videos\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"vidoes\" >}}\n\n#### The Future of Work in Scotland Webcasts\n\n\\[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### Agile Actually Podcast\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"podcast\" >}}\n\n## What classes are right for you\n\nAll of [our classes](https://nkdagility.com/training/) are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are or would like to be!\n\n#### **Everyone** - Working in an evolving company\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **[Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) Masters**\n\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Developers / Scrum Teams**\n\nCourses to help all members of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref \"/tags/scrum-team\" >}}) improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Product Owners / Product Managers**\n\ntraining to help product managers improve their abilities.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Managers**\n\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n_Contact me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization._\n",

    "BodyContent": "The world is spinning faster than ever, with more players than ever.\n\nThe introduction of Chat GPT has excited a few people but alarmed many. Sure, Chat GPT is nowhere near as bright as many of the other AI projects in play. Still, it is already showing how mediocre, repeatable work can be designated to AI or automated. This a glimpse of a future where the minimum standard won’t be enough, and you’ll need to dig deeper and deliver high-value work.\n\nAs a member of our NKD Agility tribe, we do not doubt that you’re not canon fodder for AI, but it does beg the question of where and how you will level up. What are you doing to future-proof your work capabilities in future? Many people have completed the PSM course, but never progressed. Others have invested in the PSPO course but never progressed. Think about the people who have progressed and invested in [coaching]({{< ref \"/tags/coaching\" >}}), [mentoring]({{< ref \"/tags/mentoring\" >}}), and skills development programs. Think about the gap between where you are now and where you want to be.\n\nAgile and [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) encourage and promote tough conversations. Moments of truth when we look each other in the eye and ask hard questions. Questions enable us to think about what tomorrow looks like, how we will contribute value – to our own lives and in our professional lives, and how we will stay one step ahead of our competitors – current or emerging.\n\nIf you’d like some career consulting or to ask a few questions about what better could look like, reach out to me at [martin@nkdagility.com](mailto:martin@nkdagility.com) or my LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood/)\n\nAs part of our commitment to building the next generation of super scrum stars, we’re paying for two people to level up in one of our APS (Applying [Professional Scrum]({{< ref \"/tags/professional-scrum\" >}})) or PSM II (Advanced Professional Scrum) courses. _**Simply go to my LinkedIn post for the competition and nominate a friend, a family member, a colleague, or a peer, and they could win a course.**_ If you want to be the person who wins the course, ask your friends to nominate you on the LinkedIn posts, and we’ll count those recommendations.\n\n- [https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-scrum-aps-live-virtual-learning-experience-with-certification/](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-scrum-aps-live-virtual-learning-experience-with-certification/)\n- [https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master-advanced-psm-a-training-experience-with-certification-an-advanced-scrum-master-class/](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master-advanced-psm-a-training-experience-with-certification-an-advanced-scrum-master-class/)\n\nWe look forward to your thoughts on how you will level up in 2023.

Hosted by Martin Hinshelwood and Simon Reindl, both of whom have extensive experience working with agile in a variety of industries in some of the most diverse applications on Earth, this podcast is a must-listen for anyone looking to improve their agile practice.\n\n#### Episode 1: Life coaches masquerading as Agile Coaches\n\nIn this month’s edition of #agileactually, Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in #agile for a life coach to present themselves as an #agilecoach to organizations. In most cases, an #agilecoach or #agilecosultant will have years of experience as an #agilepractitioner, actively working in an #agileteam, followed by certification and practise as an #agilecoach leading multiple #agileteams in multiple applications.\n\nThat’s why it’s controversial that someone with very little #professionalcoaching skills and #agile knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an #agilecoach. Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly?

    "BodyContent": "While all of our courses are centred around valuable learning outcomes achieved through experiential learning within a classroom environment, they are most often delivered as intense consecutive 2-day or 4-half-day experiences.\n\nThis compresses learning into a short space of time and minimises not only the amount that folks remember but also denies them the ability to try things and come back to the trainer.\n\nTo combat this we have already moved from a 2-full-day format to 4-half-days and added:\n\n- self-paced learning resources where students read, watch and write\n- 60 minutes of additional one-on-one consulting for every student\n\n**It's just not enough!**\n\nEnter the \"immersion program\"! The Immersion Program is an alternative format that extends the learning experience beyond the classroom by allowing students to apply what they have learned to real-world settings. This format is enhanced by incorporating retrospectives for improvement, making the learning experience highly effective and practical.\n\nOur first [Professional Scrum Product Owner Immersion (PSPO-I)](https://nkdagility.com/training/scheduled/professional-scrum-product-owner-immersion-pspo-i-online-3rd-july-2023-over-8-weeks/) will run from 3rd July 2023  and be delivered over 8 weekly 4h live sessions.\n\n#### What is an Immersion Program?\n\nAn Immersion Program is a method of learning where students are actively engaged in the material and apply their knowledge in real-world contexts over an extended period of time.\n\n#### Benefits of an Immersion Program\n\n- Students gain practical experience by applying their learning to their real-world context.\n- Students can affect a positive change in their environments immediately\n- Real-world application of learning increases the engagement, motivation, and personal investment of students, leading to more effective learning\n- Experiential classroom learning provides students with valuable practice in a safe environment before experimenting in their real-world context\n- Opportunities for students to collaborate and create a dynamic learning environment that exposes students to a variety of ideas and ways of thinking, deepening their understanding of the topics discussed in class\n- Retrospectives allow students to reflect on their learning with each other and the Professional [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) Trainer to make improvements and gain deeper insights\n\n#### What Do You Get With an Immersion Program?\n\n- Eight half-day interactive group class sessions guided by a [Professional Scrum]({{< ref \"/tags/professional-scrum\" >}}) Trainer (PST)\n- Opportunity to attempt a Professional Scrum assessment\n- Assignments to apply learnings in your real working environment with inspection and adaptation together with your peers and your Professional Scrum Trainer\n\n#### Who Is an Immersion Program For?\n\nThe application of learning during an Immersion Program is core to the concept. Participants should have the opportunity to work with a real team on a real product during participation in the program. If you do not have this opportunity while participating in the program, you can either find a partner to pair with, or you should consider attending a [traditional class](https://nkdagility.com/training/).\n\nImmersion Programs are an extension to our existing course offerings, not a replacement. We believe that learners have preferences and unique situations, to which we intend to offer greater variety in course delivery methods to meet these needs. The below characteristics of learners are generalized and intended to help guide you towards the learning method you think might suit you best.\n\nLearners who register for an Immersion Program:\n\n- Are committed to applying their learning and are willing to conduct small experiments at work throughout the learning experience.\n- Find it easier to fit a half-day classroom session once a week into their schedule and independently focus on intersession assignments.\n- Learn best by doing.\n- Prefer to gain knowledge, practice in a safe environment, and then apply.\n- Want to learn enough to try something quickly, then inspect and adapt to improve and grow.\n\nLearners who register for a traditional Scrum.org course:\n\n- Are committed to taking ownership of their learning experience which is dependent on full and active participation over a short period of time.\n- Find it easier to fully focus on the class and learning for two consecutive days.\n- Prefer to learn as much as possible in a condensed time-frame.\n- Learn best through discussions and conversations with their peers and instructor.\n- Want to gain a broad understanding of the subject and use it as a foundation for further independent learning.\n\n_Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization._\n\n### Community\n\nThe [Lean-Agile Practitioners Community](https://nkdagility.com/community/) has grown to over 1300+ members, and new usability updates by our platform team will hopefully make it an even bigger success this year.\n\nIt's free to join the community, and our students get access to the [Professional Scrum](https://community.nkdagility.com/spaces/5799644/feed) space for 1-on-1 [Coaching]({{< ref \"/tags/coaching\" >}}), The Situation Room, & Tails from the Trenches!\n\n_Thank you very much to all who are making this community more extraordinary._\n\n## Upcoming Training Classes\n\nFind a class and location near you or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"50\"\\]\n\nFind a class and timezone near you or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\n\n#### Our Trainers\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"\\]\n\n## What have we been up to?\n\nA short list of out blogs, videos, and webcasts!\n\n#### Recent Blog Posts\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"blog\" >}}\n\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\n\n#### Recent Videos\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"vidoes\" >}}\n\n#### The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts\n\n\\[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n## What Classes are Right for you\n\nAll of [our classes](https://nkdagility.com/training/) are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are, or would like to be!\n\n#### **Everyone** - Working in an evolving company\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Scrum Masters**\n\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Developers / Scrum Teams**\n\nCourses to help all members of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref \"/tags/scrum-team\" >}}) improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Product Owners / Product Managers**\n\ntraining to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Managers**\n\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n_Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization._\n",

From Amazon to Meta, and heaps of smaller organizations across the board.\n\nIn conjunction with this, we’ve also seen a great deal of predictions for a rough 2023 from an economic perspective. A deep recession that is anticipated to last until the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSo, what does your organization need to focus on to initially survive, and then thrive, through this period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity? How do you focus on consistently delivering value to customers and build competitive advantage when you have less people and financial resources than before? How do you galvanize the teams you have around creating and capturing value for customers in a way that aligns with organizational strategic objectives and goals?\n\nProduct Ownership is a great place to start.\n\nA great [product owner]({{< ref \"/tags/product-owner\" >}}) acts like the CEO of the product and works closely with [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}) teams, customers, and product stakeholders to focus on building the most valuable product or solving the most compelling problems. They are laser focused on prioritizing work that delights customers and aligns with core organizational objectives – such as increasing customer loyalty and referrals – to ensure maximum returns on product development investments.\n\nTough gig, but it's also a game-changer when you get it right.

    "BodyContent": "Welcome to this month's edition of NKDAgility.\n\nIn today's fast-paced, rapidly changing world, agility has become more important than ever. The ability to quickly adapt to new situations, pivot when necessary, and continuously improve is key to success in the 21st century.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore the importance of agility in today's world and how it can help organizations stay competitive and achieve their goals. We’ve selected a few of our most loved articles and videos on Agility and hope you find it valuable in your own journey towards agility.\n\n- **The difference between traditional and empirical approaches** If your organization has become successful using traditional and [project management]({{< ref \"/tags/project-management\" >}}) approaches, it can be difficult to understand why change is necessary. In short, traditional approaches work just fine if you’re working in a simple or complicated space – such as building bridges or roads. You know how to do the work, you know all the variables, and you have a fair idea of how long it will take and how much it will cost to get the job done. In complex environments, everything changes, and you need a new style of working if you’re going to build products that customers love and outcompete innovative competitors. That’s where Empiricism comes into its own. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains the difference between traditional and empirical approaches. \\[embed\\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyJzSwU74Q&ab\\_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood\\[/embed\\]\n- **Overview of The [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) Framework with Martin Hinshelwood** Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum Framework is made up of five values, three Accountabilities, three artefacts, and five events.In this video, I'll go through an overview of each one, explaining what they are for and why they are there. The focus will be on the process itself, and we will leave the complementary practices until later.\\[embed\\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Fo3sM6BVo&ab\\_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood\\[/embed\\]\n\n### Community\n\nThe [Lean-Agile Practitioners Community](https://nkdagility.com/community/) has grown to over 1300+ members, and new usability updates by our platform team will hopefully make it an even bigger success this year.\n\nIt's free to join the community, and our students get access to the [Professional Scrum](https://community.nkdagility.com/spaces/5799644/feed) space for 1-on-1 [Coaching]({{< ref \"/tags/coaching\" >}}), The Situation Room, & Tails from the Trenches!\n\n_Thank you very much to all who are making this community more extraordinary._\n\n## Upcoming Training Classes\n\nFind a class and location near you or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"\\]\n\nFind a class and location near you or [search](https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public) for more classes. [Contact us](https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/) if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\n\n#### Our Trainers\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"\\]\n\n## What have we been up to?\n\nA short list of out blogs, videos, and webcasts!\n\n#### Recent Blog Posts\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"blog\" >}}\n\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\n\n#### Recent Videos\n\n{{< recent-resources ResourceTypes=\"vidoes\" >}}\n\n#### The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts\n\n\\[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n## What Classes are Right for you\n\nAll of [our classes](https://nkdagility.com/training/) are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are, or would like to be!\n\n#### **Everyone** - Working in an evolving company\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Scrum Masters**\n\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Developers / Scrum Teams**\n\nCourses to help all members of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref \"/tags/scrum-team\" >}}) improve their skills\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Product Owners / Product Managers**\n\ntraining to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n#### **Managers**\n\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\n\n\\[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"\\]\n\n_Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization._\n",
