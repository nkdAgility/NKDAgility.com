Greetings,

We hope this message finds you in good spirits and health. As a valued member of our community, we are always looking for ways to enhance your experience and provide you with the utmost value. Today, we are thrilled to share an exciting update that does just that.

**Introducing Our Referral Programme**

We believe that knowledge is power, and sharing knowledge empowers us all. With this in mind, we have created a Referral Programme that rewards you for spreading the word about our courses.

Here’s how it works:

Every participant in each class is given a unique personal code. This code can be used to refer colleagues, friends, or anyone in your professional network to our courses. When someone you refer enrols in a class using your personal code, they will receive a 20% discount on their course fee. As a token of our appreciation, you will also receive a 20% credit towards your future classes.

The more you refer, the more you save:

If you refer one person, you get a 20% credit towards your next class. If you refer two people, you get a 40% credit towards your next class. And so on, up to 100% credit, meaning you could potentially pay nothing for a class yourself!

It’s a win-win situation:

Your referrals get a significant discount on their course fee, and you get a substantial credit towards your future classes. It’s our way of saying thank you for your continued support and for helping us grow our community of professionals.

How to Get Started:

1. Share your personal code with your colleagues, friends, or anyone in your professional network. _Claim your code at [https://nkdagility.com/become-an-advocate/](https://nkdagility.com/become-an-advocate/)_
2. Encourage them to enrol in a class and use your personal code at the time of enrolment to receive a 20% discount.
3. Once they have completed their enrolment, you will automatically receive a 20% credit towards your future classes.

It’s that simple!

We are incredibly grateful for the trust and support you have shown us over the years. Our Referral Programme is just one way we are giving back to our community. Together, we can empower each other to achieve greater success.

Thank you for being a part of our journey.

Yours in agile excellence,

Martin Hinshelwood
