    Dear Valued Clients,

    I hope this note finds you well. I wanted to let you know about a temporary change in my working location that might affect our meeting schedules over the next few weeks.

    From now until January 23rd, 2025, I'll be working from Cancun, Mexico, instead of my usual base in Glasgow. My wife and I are taking our new baby, Cassandra, to visit her Abuela and other relatives. While the scenery may differ, my commitment to supporting your teams and projects remains unchanged.

    ## What This Means for You

    * I'll be operating on Eastern Standard Time (EST) rather than GMT
    * I remain fully available for all scheduled consultations and support
    * Virtual meetings can continue as normal - just with a different time zone to consider
    * Email response times will stay consistent with what you're used to

    ## Meeting Scheduling

    For those of you in the UK/Europe, this means I'll be 5 hours behind rather than in the same time zone. I've adjusted my calendar to accommodate this shift and ensure minimal disruption to our ongoing work together.

    If you need to schedule any meetings during this period, please use my regular booking system, which will automatically adjust for the time difference.

    ## Contact Details

    All my regular contact methods remain the same:

    * Email: martin\@\nkdagility.com
    * Teams: martin\@\nkdagility.com

    I look forward to continuing our work together, albeit from a slightly more tropical location. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

    Best regards,
    Martin Hinshelwood
