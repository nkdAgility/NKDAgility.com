Spain, Portugal, Oracle, Heathrow... these weren’t random outages. They were textbook examples of systems that failed exactly as they were designed.\n\nAt Merrill Lynch, I saw it firsthand. Twice. We ran full disaster recovery drills. Everything looked like a success—until we tried to use the restored systems. Nothing worked. Why? Because the one system that everything else relied on—Active Directory—was never restored.\n\nSo yes, my app was \"restored\" successfully. But without authentication, it was useless.\n\nThis is the cost of pretending you're resilient: you run the drills, tick the boxes, declare victory... and miss the critical dependencies that actually matter.\n\nIf you’ve never validated that your system works end to end, under real pressure, then you’re not resilient. You’re wishful.\n\nReal resilience doesn’t live in plans. It lives in pain.\n",

The Sprint Goal. The Product Backlog ordering.\n\nThese are not paperwork artefacts — they are the heartbeat of alignment.\n\nWithout them, self-managing teams spin their wheels, deliver local outputs, and miss the mark on business outcomes.\n\nIt’s not the team’s fault.\n\nIt’s leadership failing to provide clarity of purpose.\n\nAutonomy and alignment are not opposites.\n\nScrum, as a social technology, requires both.\n\nIf your teams are autonomous but disconnected from strategic goals, you don’t have agility — you have expensive local optimisation.\n\nHow are you ensuring your teams are aligned without suffocating their autonomy?\n",

Most of these transformations are superficial at best. Agile isn’t about installing SAFe, Scrum@Scale, or any other framework. Those are just tools. The real game is market responsiveness—seizing opportunities faster than your competitors and adapting to change before it catches you off guard.\n\nMost large organisations became successful by building their own ways of working—tailored to their markets, customers, and business realities. Why, then, do so many think copying another company's playbook will work for them?\n\nAgility isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about survival. The companies that understand this are already outpacing the ones still debating which framework to buy.\n\nAre you custom-building agility into your organisation, or are you just running someone else’s playbook?\n",

It’s an unhedged fund with no asset securing it, no insurance to mitigate it. The cost isn’t just in future refactoring; it’s in lost time, lost agility, and lost opportunities.\n\nAt Microsoft, TFS was delivered on a two-year cycle. By 2012, with 600 engineers, they were shipping just 24 features a year. Technical debt had turned a powerhouse into a bottleneck. It wasn’t until they embraced 3-week Sprints and tackled the underlying debt that they regained agility.\n\nThis isn't just an engineering problem. It’s a business problem. If you think you can hide technical debt in a cost centre forever, think again.\n\nHow does your organisation treat technical debt? As a calculated risk or an unrecognised liability?\n",

Instead, the best Product Owners own the vision, drive outcomes, and use evidence to steer development—not just shuffle tickets in a backlog.\n\nA Product Owner isn’t a stepping stone role. It’s an accountability that demands business acumen, leadership, and the courage to make tough calls. If your PO is just managing lists, your product is already in trouble.\n\nHow does your organisation approach Product Ownership? Are you hiring for it, or just hoping the right person emerges?\n",

What you get is a Frankenstein process: too slow to be Agile, too chaotic to be controlled.\n\nThe goal isn’t to “be Agile.” It’s to outmaneuver your competitors.

Acceptance – Making hard decisions and knowing when to pivot.\n4. Access – Engaging with stakeholders and ensuring alignment.\n5. Adaptability – Constantly inspecting and adapting based on evidence.\n\nToo often, companies focus on tactical backlog refinement instead of strategic product management. The best POs influence at every level—shaping roadmaps, driving experimentation, and ensuring the product delivers real value.\n\nIf your Product Owner isn’t empowered to make meaningful decisions, they aren’t really a Product Owner. They’re just an administrator.\n\nWhich of these \"A’s\" do you think is the hardest for most POs to master?\n",

Yes, Scrum is designed for self-managing teams, but self-management is not the absence of structure.\n\nAutonomy exists within constraints—Scrum events, commitments, and organisational needs define the playing field. Without that, self-management turns into chaos.\n\nScrum Masters aren’t there to micromanage. They ensure the team has clarity, alignment, and accountability. They protect Scrum, not by controlling every decision, but by maintaining the conditions for teams to thrive.\n\nIf a team is failing to deliver, struggling with impediments, or ignoring Scrum principles, a Scrum Master doesn’t just “facilitate” and hope things improve. They step in and fix what’s broken.\n\nSelf-management works best when balanced with strong leadership.\n\nWhere do you draw the line between autonomy and intervention?\n",

You don’t measure a single cog in a machine; you measure how well the whole thing runs.\n\nWhen work sits in queues, when reviews take forever, when people are overloaded with work in progress—those are the real bottlenecks. Measuring how fast someone moves a ticket through their own swim lane tells you nothing about flow.\n\nWant to move faster? Stop monitoring individuals.

A Scrum Master for a team that delivers software that can’t critique code quality or understand DevOps practices is a Scrum Master in title only. For software teams, coding knowledge isn’t optional—it’s essential.\n\nMastery in modern engineering practices like CI/CD, automated testing, and infrastructure as code is non-negotiable. You can’t guide what you don’t understand.\n\nIf your Scrum Master doesn’t speak your Developers' language, how can they help them improve? An effective Scrum Master challenges the team, identifies technical debt, and fosters a culture of quality.\n\nWithout this, you’re not embracing true agility—just the illusion of it.\n",

You need to make decisions with incomplete information and still deliver value.

It never truly mirrors production, and every delay in feedback makes it harder to fix problems when they inevitably surface in the real world.\n\nThe reality? The only way to know how software behaves in production is to put it in production.\n\nThis is why the best engineering teams are ditching the old way in favour of audience-based deployment—rolling out changes incrementally to real users, in production, with observability and automated safeguards in place. This isn’t reckless; it’s smart.\n\nIf you’re still relying on pre-prod environments for confidence, it’s time to ask yourself: Are they really reducing risk, or just making failures more expensive?\n",

A Scrum Master who can’t speak the language of your teams won’t be much use when it comes to removing impediments, coaching the team, and driving organisational change.\n\nA certification isn’t a guarantee of competence, but it’s a decent starting point. If someone isn’t willing to spend $200 on a PSM I or $250 on a PSM II to validate their knowledge, what does that say about their commitment?\n\nIf you want a Scrum Master who makes a difference, stop looking for someone to “run stand-ups” and start looking for someone who challenges assumptions, coaches teams, and ensures delivery of real value.\n\nHiring?
