Most companies still get Product Ownership wrong. They either treat it as a glorified backlog manager or assume any business analyst can do the job. But a real Product Owner isn’t just an order taker. They are a product strategist, decision-maker, and stakeholder wrangler, responsible for maximising product value.

The misconception that a Product Owner is a "requirements gatherer" leads to weak products and misaligned teams. Instead, the best Product Owners own the vision, drive outcomes, and use evidence to steer development—not just shuffle tickets in a backlog.

A Product Owner isn’t a stepping stone role. It’s an accountability that demands business acumen, leadership, and the courage to make tough calls. If your PO is just managing lists, your product is already in trouble.

How does your organisation approach Product Ownership? Are you hiring for it, or just hoping the right person emerges?
