Scrum is built on empiricism—transparency, inspection, and adaptation. But what happens when there’s nothing to inspect?

A Scrum Team that isn’t delivering isn’t a Scrum Team at all. If every sprint doesn’t produce a usable increment, you’re not doing Scrum. Period.

Here’s where the Scrum Master comes in. Their accountability isn’t just to the team—it’s to the organisation. The business depends on delivery. Customers depend on working products.

If delivery isn’t happening, the Scrum Master owns that failure. They are accountable for creating an environment where delivery is inevitable.

No increment? No excuses. Own it. Fix it. Deliver.

Thoughts? How does your org handle this accountability?
