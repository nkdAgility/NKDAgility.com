Do you know what’s worse than fixing a bug? Building the wrong thing in the first place.

The data is clear: Only 35% of features actually deliver value. That means 65% of what teams build is waste—work that never should have been done.

The solution? Shorter feedback loops.

Frequent reviews, real user feedback, and fast iteration cycles keep teams focused on what actually matters instead of churning out features no one needs. If you’re still waiting until “the end” of a sprint to check if something is right, you’re already too late.

Shorten your feedback loops, or prepare to waste time and money on work that never delivers value.

What’s stopping your team from getting fast, actionable feedback?
