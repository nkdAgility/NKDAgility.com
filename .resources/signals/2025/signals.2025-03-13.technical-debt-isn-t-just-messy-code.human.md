Technical debt isn’t just messy code. It’s slow feedback, brittle systems, and manual processes that grind delivery to a halt. It’s why teams spend more time firefighting than innovating.

But here’s the thing: technical debt is a choice. Every time a team pushes off refactoring, skips automation, or accepts a fragile deployment process, they’re choosing to accumulate debt. And like financial debt, it compounds.

The only way out is to pay it down. Automate. Test early and often. Adopt trunk-based development. Remove friction from your pipelines. The cost of fixing it now is always less than the cost of delaying.
