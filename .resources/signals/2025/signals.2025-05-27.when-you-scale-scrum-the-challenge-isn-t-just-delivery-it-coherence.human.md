When you scale Scrum, the challenge isn’t just delivery—it’s coherence. UX is a great example. Left unchecked, each team reinvents the wheel, creates inconsistent interactions, and loses alignment.

The answer isn’t a central UX team doing all the work. It’s a Community of Practice made up of practitioners from each Scrum Team, collaborating to evolve a shared interaction framework. That framework then becomes part of your Definition of Done.

This isn’t about control. It’s about shared ownership and reuse without bottlenecks.

UX coherence at scale is a system design problem. Don’t solve it with more hierarchy. Solve it with better collaboration.

How are your UX practices scaling with your teams?
