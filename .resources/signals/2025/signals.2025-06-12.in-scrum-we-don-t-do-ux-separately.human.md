In Scrum, we don’t do UX separately. We don’t have a “UX Sprint.” UX is part of the product. That means UX work is either:

1. Needed to meet the Sprint Goal—so it’s done during the Sprint.
2. Needed for future work—so it’s done as part of ongoing Product Backlog Refinement.

It’s that simple.

If you’re off doing speculative design in a vacuum, disconnected from the team, you’re not doing Scrum. You’re delaying learning and undermining flow. UX belongs in the real world, integrated into the delivery of value, not staged like a phase from a project plan.

Design as you go. Validate early. Iterate continuously.

Still running “design sprints”? Maybe it’s time to rethink what “done” really means for your team.
