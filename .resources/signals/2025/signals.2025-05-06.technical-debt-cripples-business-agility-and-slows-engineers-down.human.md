Technical debt doesn’t just slow engineers down—it cripples business agility.

When software becomes too fragile to change quickly, every product decision takes longer. Every market opportunity is harder to seize. And suddenly, you're not competing on innovation anymore—you’re just trying to keep up.

This isn’t a theoretical risk. It happened at Microsoft. It happens in every enterprise that delays paying back technical debt.

The solution? Shorten feedback loops. Automate everything. Make transparency the default. And, above all, stop accepting technical debt as an inevitability.

Your ability to respond to the market depends on how you manage technical debt today.

How much is it costing your business to maintain the status quo?
