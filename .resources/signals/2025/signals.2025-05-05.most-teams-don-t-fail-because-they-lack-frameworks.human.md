Most teams don’t fail because they lack frameworks.  
They fail because they don't act on the feedback those frameworks expose.

Agile and Scrum light up the broken parts of your system like a warning light on a dashboard.  
Ignoring them doesn't make the problems go away. It makes them worse.

The hardest part of agility isn’t getting a team to do Sprints.  
The hardest part is building an environment where it’s safe—and expected—to act on what you learn.

A team that delivers real change is a team that is listened to, respected, and empowered to make the hard calls.

If you treat every signal as an opportunity, not a threat, you will outlearn and outperform your competitors.

Are you listening to your signals or silencing them?
