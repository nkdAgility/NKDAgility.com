I’ll never understand teams that “manage” bugs instead of just fixing them.

A bug backlog? Why. Just fix them.

A meeting to discuss bug prioritisation? Stop it. Just fix them.

A ticket that’s been sitting in “QA” for weeks? Absurd. Just fix it.

Here’s the deal: Known defects are holes in the ship. You don’t argue about whether to patch them while the water pours in. If a bug is found, it gets fixed. If it’s too big, escalate it and prioritise the fix. The longer you wait, the worse it gets.

Agile is about working software. Not half-working software with a spreadsheet full of problems you hope to deal with someday.

How does your team handle bugs? Are you fixing them or just shuffling them around?
