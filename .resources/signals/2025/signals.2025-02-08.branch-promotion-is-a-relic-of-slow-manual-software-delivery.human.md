Branch promotion is a relic of slow, manual software delivery.

Modern teams integrate continuously:

- Every change merges into main as soon as it’s ready.
- Deployments are decoupled from releases using feature flags.
- Testing happens in production-like environments without blocking releases.

This approach makes rollbacks instant—no need for painful cherry-picking. And it eliminates reverse integration, a practice that introduces more risk than it removes.

The best teams don’t manage branches. They manage flow.
