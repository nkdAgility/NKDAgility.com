Frederick Taylor’s legacy is still alive—and it’s not a flattering one.

He told the world that most people couldn’t think for themselves, so we had to break work into tiny, repeatable pieces. That’s why we have titles that mean nothing, bonuses that bribe instead of inspire, and departments that hoard knowledge instead of sharing it.

This wasn’t about helping people grow. It was about making them easier to replace.

Now that AI and automation are exposing just how much of our work is built on cognitive repetition, we have a choice.

Keep pretending this system works.

Or rebuild it around mastery, autonomy, and outcomes.

Most organisations haven’t made the shift. They’re still paying bonuses and calling it motivation. Still promoting titles and calling it progress.

AI isn’t just automating tasks. It’s holding up a mirror.

What does it say about your organisation?
