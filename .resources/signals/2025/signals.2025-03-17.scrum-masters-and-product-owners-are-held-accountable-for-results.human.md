Scrum Masters and Product Owners are held accountable for results. But here’s the contradiction—how can you be accountable for something you have no control over?

Too often, Scrum Masters are expected to ensure team effectiveness without the authority to remove impediments, challenge dysfunction, or enforce alignment. Influence is important, but it’s not enough. Leadership without control is just a suggestion.

If the Product Owner’s authority to prioritise and maximise value is accepted, why do we hesitate to acknowledge the Scrum Master’s authority to uphold agility and effectiveness?

Accountability without authority is an empty expectation. If we want better outcomes, we need to empower those responsible for delivering them.

Are Scrum Masters in your organisation truly empowered or just expected to "coach" from the sidelines?
