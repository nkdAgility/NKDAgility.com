Every time I hear, “We don’t have time for automation,” I know exactly what’s coming next.

- Regressions slowing down releases
- Testers overwhelmed with manual work
- Bugs slipping through because “there wasn’t time” to retest everything
- A release cycle that feels like a game of Russian roulette

Manual testing is not scalable. If you’re serious about agility, you need automation. Otherwise, your “fast-moving” team is only as fast as the slowest manual test run.

Automated tests are the only way to keep up with change while ensuring quality. No more excuses.

What’s holding your team back from full automation?
