The FBI's Sentinel project was textbook waterfall. Big budget. Big bang. Zero value delivered after four years and hundreds of millions spent.

The solution? Throw it out. Build a basement Scrum Studio. Hand-pick 40 people. Give them space to work iteratively.

Within a year: $30 million. Working product.

Agile didn’t just save the project—it exposed the insanity of pretending waterfall ever worked at this scale.

If you're still defending your 18-month Gantt chart, ask yourself: what would your stakeholders say after four years and nothing in production?

That’s not control. That’s negligence.
