title: The FBI Sentinel project was textbook waterfall
short_title: 'FBI Sentinel: Waterfall Failure, Agile Success'
description: The FBI Sentinel project failed with a waterfall approach, wasting years and budget, but succeeded rapidly after switching to Agile and iterative Scrum methods.
tldr: The FBI's Sentinel project failed after years and massive spending using a traditional waterfall approach, delivering nothing. Switching to a small, focused Agile team produced a working product in a year at a fraction of the cost. Consider adopting iterative methods to avoid wasted time and resources and deliver real value sooner.

The FBI's Sentinel project was textbook waterfall. Big budget. Big bang. Zero value delivered after four years and hundreds of millions spent.

The solution? Throw it out. Build a basement Scrum Studio. Hand-pick 40 people. Give them space to work iteratively.

Within a year: $30 million. Working product.

Agile didn’t just save the project—it exposed the insanity of pretending waterfall ever worked at this scale.

If you're still defending your 18-month Gantt chart, ask yourself: what would your stakeholders say after four years and nothing in production?

That’s not control. That’s negligence.
