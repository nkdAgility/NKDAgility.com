Scrum Masters are not glorified meeting schedulers.

They are technical and business leaders who ensure that teams deliver continuous value. A Scrum Master for a team that delivers software that can’t critique code quality or understand DevOps practices is a Scrum Master in title only. For software teams, coding knowledge isn’t optional—it’s essential.

Mastery in modern engineering practices like CI/CD, automated testing, and infrastructure as code is non-negotiable. You can’t guide what you don’t understand.

If your Scrum Master doesn’t speak your Developers' language, how can they help them improve? An effective Scrum Master challenges the team, identifies technical debt, and fosters a culture of quality.

Without this, you’re not embracing true agility—just the illusion of it.
