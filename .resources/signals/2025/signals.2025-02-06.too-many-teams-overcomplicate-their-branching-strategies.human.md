Too many teams overcomplicate their branching strategies. The best engineering teams focus on flow, not friction.

Branching models should enable fast delivery, not slow it down. The best approach? Keep it simple:

✅ GitHub Flow – Short-lived feature branches, immediate merges to main, and continuous deployment.  
✅ Release Flow – If multiple versions must be supported, fixes go into main first, then cherry-picked into a release branch.

No long-lived branches. No unnecessary merges. No reverse integration nightmares.

Teams that eliminate unnecessary complexity move faster, reduce risk, and deliver value consistently. Stop promoting branches. Start shipping.
