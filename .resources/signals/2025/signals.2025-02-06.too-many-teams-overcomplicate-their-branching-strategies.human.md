short_title: Simplifying Branching Strategies for Teams
description: Learn why simple branching strategies like GitHub Flow and Release Flow help teams deliver faster, reduce risk, and avoid the pitfalls of complex version control.
tldr: Many teams make branching too complex, which slows delivery and adds risk. Simple models like GitHub Flow or Release Flow help teams move faster and deliver value more consistently. Focus on minimizing branching complexity to improve speed and reliability.

Too many teams overcomplicate their branching strategies. The best engineering teams focus on flow, not friction.

Branching models should enable fast delivery, not slow it down. The best approach? Keep it simple:

✅ GitHub Flow – Short-lived feature branches, immediate merges to main, and continuous deployment.  
✅ Release Flow – If multiple versions must be supported, fixes go into main first, then cherry-picked into a release branch.

No long-lived branches. No unnecessary merges. No reverse integration nightmares.

Teams that eliminate unnecessary complexity move faster, reduce risk, and deliver value consistently. Stop promoting branches. Start shipping.
