Too many organisations hide behind excuses:

"We can't do that here."  
"We're not a software company."  
"We're regulated."

The DOD and FBI are proof that excuse is dead. You can be large, slow, and bureaucratic—and still move to iterative delivery.

Agile is not about being cool or trendy. It's about reducing risk, increasing optionality, and delivering real value incrementally.

Regulated industries aren’t excluded from agility. They're the ones that need it most.
