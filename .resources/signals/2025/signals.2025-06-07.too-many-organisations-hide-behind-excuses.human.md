short_title: Too Many Organisations Hide Behind Excuses
description: Many organisations use excuses to avoid Agile, but even large, regulated bodies can adopt iterative delivery to reduce risk and deliver value incrementally.
tldr: Even large, regulated, and traditionally slow organizations like the DOD and FBI have successfully adopted iterative delivery, showing that excuses for not embracing agile are unfounded. Agile helps reduce risk, increase flexibility, and deliver value incrementally, which is especially important in regulated industries. Development managers should challenge resistance and prioritize agile practices to improve outcomes regardless of organizational constraints.

Too many organisations hide behind excuses:

"We can't do that here."  
"We're not a software company."  
"We're regulated."

The DOD and FBI are proof that excuse is dead. You can be large, slow, and bureaucratic—and still move to iterative delivery.

Agile is not about being cool or trendy. It's about reducing risk, increasing optionality, and delivering real value incrementally.

Regulated industries aren’t excluded from agility. They're the ones that need it most.
