The idea of deploying an operating system like Windows directly to production would have been unthinkable a decade ago. But that’s exactly what Microsoft does now.

The old way, shipping a monolithic OS update every few years, was slow, brittle, and disconnected from real users. They needed faster feedback and a way to catch issues early.

Enter ring-based deployment.

Instead of shipping to everyone at once, Windows updates now roll out gradually:

- ✅ First to internal engineers.
- ✅ Then to Microsoft employees.
- ✅ Then to millions of Windows Insiders across multiple tiers.
- ✅ Finally, to general availability.

At every step, telemetry dictates whether a release moves forward or stops. Issues are identified before they hit the full user base.

Windows is a local install. It runs on 900 million machines across an infinite combination of hardware and software. And yet, they still found a way to deploy incrementally, learn from real users, and roll forward safely.

If they can do it, what’s stopping your team?
