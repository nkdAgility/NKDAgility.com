Some teams love to wave the "we’re self-managing" flag whenever alignment is discussed. But let’s be real—autonomy doesn’t mean doing whatever you want, whenever you want. It means taking ownership within a shared framework.

Scrum provides a system where teams have the freedom to decide how they deliver, but that doesn’t mean they can ignore Scrum events, commitments, or organisational goals. The Product Owner ensures alignment to business value. The Scrum Master ensures alignment to agility. The team ensures alignment to delivery.

Autonomy without alignment isn’t self-management—it’s dysfunction. True self-management is earned through trust, consistency, and accountability.

So the question is: Is your team truly self-managing, or just avoiding accountability under the guise of autonomy?
