Scrum Masters must master three domains: technical, business, and organisational.

Anything less is a disservice to the team, the Product Owner, and the business.

They must navigate complex systems, align work with strategic objectives, and confidently cause the removal of obstacles. An effective Scrum Master understands software development, advocates for business value, and influences organisational change. If you want real agility, hire real leaders.

Certifications fade, but competence built through experience endures. Demand more from your Scrum Masters, and they will deliver more for your business.

True agility requires bold leadership, and your Scrum Master must be that leader.
