Hiring a junior Scrum Master at half the salary and expecting full performance is like hiring a junior chef and expecting a Michelin star!

When the food is bad, it’s not the framework's fault. Scrum doesn’t fail—people do. Pay for expertise. Hire Scrum Masters who can lead, challenge, and deliver from day one.

The cost of inexperience is far higher than the salary savings. Agile isn’t cheap, but failure is even more expensive. Investing in an experienced Scrum Master means investing in better products, happier teams, and faster delivery. Cutting corners on leadership only leads to chaos, delays, and subpar outcomes.

Choose wisely.
