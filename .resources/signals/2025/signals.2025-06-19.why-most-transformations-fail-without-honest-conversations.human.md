short_title: Why Transformations Fail Without Honesty
description: Most transformations fail without open, honest conversations that address real issues, making transparency and tough dialogue essential for true organisational agility.
tldr: Most transformation efforts fail because teams avoid honest conversations about real issues. Creating space for open dialogue leads to genuine improvement and transparency, which are essential for true agility. Development managers should ensure their teams regularly discuss tough topics to drive meaningful change.

Most transformation efforts fail because the hard conversations never happen.

In every Applying Professional Scrum class I run, the magic is in the room, not the slides. We create a space where people speak plainly—about friction, confusion, blockers, and bad assumptions.

At Backcountry, even the warehouse staff joined the training. At Healthgrades, every session was packed with real questions. Real frustrations. Real intent to improve.

These are not “training sessions.” They’re catalysts.

Scrum is not a framework for Developers. It’s a framework for organisational transparency. And transparency is uncomfortable—but necessary.

If you’re not making space for hard truths, you’re not building agility. You’re just managing optics.

What conversations still aren’t happening in your org?
