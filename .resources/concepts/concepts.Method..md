title: Method
ClassificationType: concepts
trustpilot: false
abstract: Method refers to a structured, step-by-step approach employed to achieve specific objectives within a system, distinguishing itself from frameworks that provide broader guidelines. In Agile, Lean, and DevOps environments, methods are vital for guiding teams through systematic processes that enhance collaborative work, value delivery, and continuous improvement. They are utilised to optimise workflows, manage iterative development, and measure progress effectively. For example, the Scrum method outlines a sequence of events such as Sprint Planning and Daily Scrum to facilitate work in short cycles, while the Kanban method aids in visualising workflows and limiting work in progress. Methods ensure consistency and predictability in outcomes by breaking down complex processes into manageable tasks, allowing teams to execute with precision and adapt to real-time feedback. In Lean, methods focus on eliminating waste to maximise value delivery, whereas in DevOps, practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery enable rapid and reliable software releases. It is crucial to differentiate methods from frameworks, which provide structural foundations, and practices, which are individual techniques within broader methods. By adhering to structured methods, teams can enhance efficiency, ensure alignment, and consistently deliver value, empowering them to be proactive and adaptable in problem-solving, ultimately leading to improved performance and outcomes. Methods are flexible and can be tailored to fit the unique context of a team or project, allowing for continuous refinement while maintaining a clear path toward goal achievement.

  **Use this category only for discussions on Method.**  
  This category focuses on the structured, step-by-step procedures used to achieve specific goals within Agile, Lean, DevOps, and other contexts. Methods define the practices and actions needed to implement frameworks or solve specific problems.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The Scrum method and its specific procedures for delivering value
  - The Kanban method for visualising and managing work
  - Lean principles and their methodical approach to reducing waste
  - Extreme Programming (XP) practices and their iterative cycles
  - Methods for iterative and incremental development
  - Agile planning and estimation techniques
  - Continuous feedback and improvement loops as methods
  - How methods enhance collaboration, transparency, and decision-making

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on frameworks or philosophies
  - Misinterpretations of methods as broader philosophies or values
  - Content that focuses on tools or software rather than the structured procedural approach

**Method** refers to a structured, step-by-step approach used to achieve specific goals within a system. Unlike **frameworks**, which offer broader structures and guidelines, methods are focused on **detailed procedures** and **actions** that enable teams to implement solutions or solve problems.

In **Agile**, **Lean**, and **DevOps** environments, methods play a crucial role in **guiding** teams through systematic steps that support **collaborative work**, **value delivery**, and **continuous improvement**. Methods are often employed to **optimise workflows**, **manage iterative development**, and **measure progress**.

For instance, in the **Scrum** method, teams follow a set sequence of events—**Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrum**, **Sprint Review**, and **Sprint Retrospective**—to manage work in short, repeatable cycles, continuously adapting to changing requirements. Similarly, the **Kanban** method helps teams visualise their workflow, limit work in progress, and ensure that work is completed efficiently.

Methods are essential for ensuring **consistency and predictability** in outcomes. They break down complex processes into manageable tasks, allowing teams to execute with precision and adapt in real-time to feedback.

In **Lean**, the method of identifying and eliminating waste ensures teams focus on delivering the most value with the least amount of effort, enabling continuous improvement. In **DevOps**, methods like **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery** enable teams to release high-quality software rapidly and reliably.

It is important to distinguish **methods** from **frameworks** and **practices**:

- **Frameworks** like Scrum or Kanban provide the **structural foundation** for teams, outlining roles and events, but they do not prescribe specific methods for every action.
- **Practices**, such as Pair Programming or Test-Driven Development (TDD), are individual techniques that are part of the broader methods teams adopt.

By following structured methods, teams can increase **efficiency**, ensure **alignment**, and consistently deliver value to customers. These methods empower teams to be proactive, iterative, and adaptable in their approach to problem-solving, ultimately leading to improved performance and outcomes.

A method is not rigid; it can be tailored to fit the **unique context** of a team or project, allowing teams to continuously refine their approach while maintaining a clear, systematic path toward achieving their goals.
