title: Tenet
ClassificationType: concepts
trustpilot: false
abstract: A tenet is a specific, actionable guiding rule or doctrine that reinforces a larger philosophy within an organisation, distinguishing itself from values and principles by providing prescriptive direction for team behaviour in specific situations. Originating from frameworks like Kanban and Agile, tenets such as "Flow efficiency over resource efficiency" and "decentralised decision-making" translate overarching philosophies into concrete actions, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and responsiveness. Their importance lies in their ability to create a consistent organisational culture, guiding decision-making and behaviour across teams while remaining stable amidst changing practices. By embedding tenets into daily operations, organisations can align actions with broader philosophical frameworks, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning, which is essential for sustainable success in dynamic environments. Tenets serve as the foundation for collective behaviour, ensuring that teams work cohesively towards shared goals, ultimately driving adaptability and effectiveness in product development and organisational design.

  **Use this category only for discussions on Tenet.**  
  Tenets are specific, actionable guiding rules or doctrines that help shape decision-making and behaviours within an organisation. They are more prescriptive than values, translating abstract beliefs into concrete practices that guide teams in achieving their goals. This category applies to content discussing the application of tenets in Agile, DevOps, Lean, and other methodologies.

  **Key Topics:**
  - "Flow efficiency over resource efficiency" in Kanban
  - Decentralised decision-making as a core tenet of Agile
  - Continuous improvement as a cultural norm in Lean
  - The role of feedback loops in driving performance in DevOps
  - Evidence-based decision-making as a strategic principle
  - Emphasis on collaboration and communication across teams
  - Adaptability and responsiveness as core tenets of organisational agility

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - General discussions on values or philosophies without specific, actionable rules.
  - Personal anecdotes or misinterpretations of tenets that deviate from their original intent.
  - Content that strays from core tenets of Agile, Lean, DevOps, or Evidence-Based Management.

A **tenet** is a **specific, actionable guiding rule** or **doctrine** that reinforces a larger philosophy within an organisation. Unlike **values**, which express what is important to an organisation, or **principles**, which provide broad guidance, tenets are **prescriptive** and define **how** teams should act in specific situations.

For example, in **Kanban**, the tenet “**Flow efficiency over resource efficiency**” directs teams to prioritise smooth, continuous workflow rather than simply maximising resource utilisation. This tenet translates the philosophy of **flow** into actionable behaviour—guiding teams on how to improve operational efficiency and value delivery.

Tenets are more than just rules—they provide clear, consistent direction for **decision-making** and **behaviour** across teams. They are **actionable** beliefs that help guide how teams operate day to day. By embedding tenets into daily operations, organisations can ensure that their actions align with larger philosophical frameworks. For instance, **decentralised decision-making** is a core tenet in **Agile**, empowering teams to make decisions quickly and autonomously, improving agility and responsiveness.

The long-term nature of tenets makes them essential in creating a consistent organisational culture. They are not just about individual actions or practices; they define the **collective behaviour** that teams should embrace to reach their goals. While **practices** may change depending on the project or technology, **tenets** remain stable, providing the foundation upon which practices are built.

Tenets also play a vital role in fostering **continuous improvement**. For example, the tenet of **continuous improvement** in **Lean** encourages teams to regularly reflect on their processes and outcomes, promoting a culture of learning and adaptation. This mindset of ongoing refinement is crucial for **sustainable success** in fast-changing environments.

It is important to distinguish **tenets** from **values** and **principles**:

- **Values** are foundational beliefs that guide an organisation’s culture but are often broad and abstract.
- **Principles** are broad beliefs or guidelines for behaviour, but they are less prescriptive than tenets.
- **Tenets**, by contrast, are **actionable** rules that directly inform decision-making and practices.

In summary, tenets are the **specific, actionable rules** that help organisations translate high-level philosophies into day-to-day actions. They shape decision-making and behaviours, ensuring that teams remain aligned with organisational values and goals. By embedding these tenets into an organisation’s culture, teams can work more cohesively and effectively, driving continuous improvement, adaptability, and sustainable success.
