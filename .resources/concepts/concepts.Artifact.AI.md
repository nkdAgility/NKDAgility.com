title: Artifact
ClassificationType: concepts
trustpilot: false
abstract: An artifact is a formal, inspectable output that signifies work and progress within a delivery system, particularly in Agile, Lean, and DevOps methodologies. These artifacts, which include the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment in Scrum, are essential for fostering a shared understanding among teams and stakeholders regarding the status of work, what has been completed, and what remains to be done. They are not merely tools or documents; rather, they are defined constructs that promote transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Artifacts play a crucial role in empirical decision-making by allowing teams to assess the current state of work, identify potential risks, and adjust their strategies accordingly. In Kanban and DevOps, similar constructs such as visual work boards and deployment pipelines serve as artifacts that reveal delivery progress and system behaviour. By actively facilitating delivery governance, artifacts enhance alignment, support evidence-based forecasting, and build trust between stakeholders and teams through the visibility of progress and value delivery. Their effective use is vital for successful product development and organisational design, as they contribute to a culture of continuous improvement and responsiveness to change.

Instructions: |-
  **Use this tag only for content focused on artifacts as formal representations of work.**  
  An artifact is a tangible, transparent construct that enables inspection and adaptation by making key aspects of the work visible. This tag applies to content that explores the structure, purpose, and role of artifacts in Agile, Scrum, Lean, and DevOps systems.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition of artifacts in Agile, Scrum, and Lean
  - The purpose of artifacts in transparency and empirical control
  - Types of artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment, Definition of Done, etc.
  - Best practices for managing and evolving artifacts
  - Use of artifacts in evidence-based decision-making
  - The role of artifacts in cross-team coordination and scale

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Tools or software used to create artifacts (e.g. Jira, Excel)
  - Abstract principles not tied to specific artifacts
  - Cultural discussions about collaboration unrelated to artifact structure

  subtitle: Defined outputs that make progress, quality, and value transparent and inspectable.
  content: Artifacts are formal representations of work, defined by Agile frameworks to ensure key information is transparent and available for inspection. Posts should focus on how artifacts enable empirical process control, support delivery alignment, and provide traceable insight into progress, quality, and product value.

An **artifact** is a formal, inspectable output that represents work and progress in a system of delivery. In Agile, Lean, and DevOps contexts, artifacts provide a shared understanding of what is being worked on, what is Done, and what remains. They are not tools or documents, but defined constructs that exist to support transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

In Scrum, there are three core artifacts: the **Product Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, and the **Increment**. Each artifact is designed to make key information visible and understandable. The **Definition of Done** further ensures that an Increment meets a standard of quality and completeness.

Artifacts serve as reference points for empirical decision-making. They enable teams and stakeholders to inspect the current state of the work, identify risks, and adapt their approach. In Kanban and DevOps, similar constructs exist—such as visual work boards, flow diagrams, and deployment pipelines—that function as artifacts by exposing delivery progress and system behaviour.

Artifacts are not passive records. They are active instruments of delivery governance. When used effectively, they enhance alignment, support evidence-based forecasting, and reinforce trust between stakeholders and teams by making progress and value delivery visible.
