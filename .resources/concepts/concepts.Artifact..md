  **Use this category only for discussions on Artefacts.**  
  An **artefact** is a tangible and transparent output resulting from a team's collaborative effort, which provides essential information used for inspection, adaptation, and decision-making in product development. The purpose of this category is to explore the various artefacts produced within Agile, Lean, and DevOps methodologies, highlighting their role in enhancing transparency and facilitating effective communication among team members and stakeholders.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - Definition and importance of artefacts in Agile and Lean practices.
  - Types of artefacts, such as product backlogs, sprint backlogs, increment deliveries, and visual task boards.
  - The role of artefacts in supporting transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
  - How artefacts contribute to evidence-based decision-making and continuous improvement.
  - Best practices for creating and maintaining artefacts to maximise their effectiveness.
  - Examples of artefacts used in various frameworks, including Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that do not directly relate to the definition, purpose, or types of artefacts, as well as misinterpretations of their role within Agile, Lean, or DevOps contexts.

An **artefact** is a tangible outcome or visible representation of work that supports transparency, inspection, and adaptation within agile or lean environments. Artefacts capture essential information about progress, quality, or value delivered, enabling teams and stakeholders to make informed decisions and effectively respond to change. Common artefacts across agile and lean practices may include prioritised lists of work, visual task boards, delivery increments, operational metrics, and process improvement records. By providing clarity and actionable insight, artefacts serve as foundational tools for continuous improvement and evidence-based decision-making.
