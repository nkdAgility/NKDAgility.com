title: Strategy
abstract: Strategy is a high-level approach that directs an organisation towards its long-term objectives, distinguishing itself from methods and practices that focus on execution. It serves as an overarching framework that integrates various methods, practices, and decision-making processes, ensuring that daily activities and tactical choices contribute to the organisation's broader goals. In Agile and DevOps contexts, strategy aligns teams and technologies with business aims, exemplified by approaches like Lean Product Development, which prioritises value delivery and waste reduction. Leadership plays a crucial role in strategy by establishing vision and direction while empowering teams to operate within this framework. Strategic planning in Agile organisations incorporates evidence-based management to inform decisions and maintain alignment with customer needs and market dynamics. Unlike methods that prescribe specific procedures, strategy offers a flexible guiding framework that can adapt to changing circumstances, fostering resilience and responsiveness to both internal and external challenges. Ultimately, strategy provides clarity, focus, and adaptability, enabling organisations to navigate complexity and achieve sustained success in a dynamic environment.

**Strategy** is a **high-level approach** that guides an organisation towards achieving its long-term goals. Unlike **methods** or **practices**, which provide the **how** of execution, **strategy** defines the **direction** and **purpose** of those actions. It is about ensuring that resources, teams, and methods are **aligned** with the organisation's overall vision and mission.

Strategy is an overarching framework that integrates multiple **methods**, **practices**, and **decision-making frameworks** to provide a coherent path forward. It ensures that day-to-day activities and tactical decisions contribute to the larger goals of the organisation. For example, the **Lean Product Development** strategy focuses on **maximising value delivery** while reducing waste, ensuring that the team’s activities align with business objectives and customer needs.

In Agile and **DevOps** environments, strategy is about aligning **teams** and **technologies** with business goals. For instance, **Kanban strategy** helps optimise flow, ensure that value is delivered efficiently, and provide a consistent pace of work that supports organisational priorities.

The role of **leadership** in **strategy** is pivotal, as leaders are responsible for setting the vision and direction while empowering teams to operate within the strategic framework. **Strategic planning** in Agile organisations involves integrating **evidence-based management** principles to make informed decisions and maintain alignment with customer needs and market demands.

Unlike **methods**, which provide structured procedures for performing tasks, **strategy** is broader and more flexible, offering a **guiding framework** that can be adapted over time based on changing circumstances. Strategy is designed to enable **adaptability** in the face of **complexity**, ensuring that organisations remain resilient and responsive to both internal and external challenges.

In summary, **strategy** is the **high-level approach** that provides the **direction** for achieving organisational goals.

By providing clarity, focus, and flexibility, strategy helps organisations navigate complexity and achieve long-term success while remaining agile and responsive to change.
