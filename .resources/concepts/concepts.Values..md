title: Values
abstract: Value refers to the core beliefs and principles that influence the behaviours and decision-making processes of individuals and organisations. These values serve as a foundational element in various methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Lean, guiding how work is approached and how teams interact. Unlike performance metrics, values represent enduring principles that shape organisational culture, ethics, and accountability. They encompass key aspects such as respect for individuals, commitment to transparency, and a focus on continuous improvement, which are essential for fostering collaboration and breaking down silos. By prioritising values, organisations can create a culture that not only enhances productivity but also aligns actions with their mission and long-term objectives. This philosophical foundation helps teams navigate complex environments, ensuring that decisions are made ethically and sustainably. Ultimately, embedding strong values within an organisation cultivates an environment conducive to innovation, adaptability, and resilience, which are crucial for long-term success in today's rapidly evolving landscape.

**Values** represents the deeply held **beliefs** and **principles** that shape the way individuals and organisations think, act, and collaborate. These values form the **foundation** for decision-making and behaviours, influencing everything from leadership and accountability to team dynamics and culture. In the context of Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Lean, values are not about **immediate outcomes** or **performance metrics**; they represent **enduring principles** that guide how work is approached, how people interact, and how ethical decisions are made.

### The Role of Values in Ways of Working

Values are the guiding principles that inform **decision-making** at all levels within an organisation. They shape **behaviour**, **culture**, and the **ethics** of how work is performed. Key values include:

- **Agile Values**: Emphasising **individuals and interactions**, **customer collaboration**, and **responding to change**.
- **Scrum Values**: These values—**commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect**—guide teams towards transparency, accountability, and high performance.
- **Lean Thinking**: **Respect for people** and **continuous improvement** are central, fostering a culture of sustainability and value delivery.
- **DevOps Culture**: Collaboration, **shared accountability**, and **trust** are key values that break down silos and enable faster, more reliable delivery.

### Values as a Philosophical Foundation

Unlike methods or practices, which focus on specific actions or processes, **values** represent the **"why"** behind the actions. They are **ethical and philosophical anchors** that influence how teams operate in complex and uncertain environments. Values help teams **prioritise** what is most important and ensure that actions are aligned with the organisation's mission, vision, and long-term objectives.

For example:

- **Respect**: Treating people with dignity and valuing diverse perspectives.
- **Courage**: Challenging assumptions and embracing change.
- **Transparency**: Maintaining openness and honesty in communication.
- **Accountability**: Taking ownership of actions and continuously learning from mistakes.
- **Adaptability**: Embracing change and learning continuously.

### Beyond Outcomes: Values as Enduring Beliefs

It is important to emphasise that **values** should never be reduced to **metrics** or **performance indicators**. While they inform strategic decision-making, their true purpose is to guide behaviour and shape the **organisational culture**. When an organisation deeply internalises its core values, those values guide its teams to make decisions that are in alignment with the organisation's broader mission and ethical stance.

Organisations that embed strong values within their culture create environments where people thrive—not just in terms of productivity, but in how they think, collaborate, and continuously learn. This focus on values ensures that organisations are not just executing tasks, but driving **long-term success** in a **sustainable** and **ethical** manner.

In summary, values form the **philosophical foundation** for decision-making and teamwork within an organisation. They guide behaviour, shape culture, and ensure that teams are aligned with organisational goals. By fostering an environment where values are deeply embedded, organisations can ensure they remain adaptable, innovative, and resilient in a rapidly changing environment.
