Instructions: |-
  Use this category only for discussions on Service Level Expectation (SLE).

  **Scope and Purpose:**  
  This category is strictly for content that explains, applies, or analyses the concept of Service Level Expectation (SLE) as defined in the context of Agile, Scrum, and Kanban practices. The SLE is a forecast of the time it should take for a work item to move from initiation to completion within a team’s workflow, expressed as a range of elapsed days with an associated probability. The purpose of the SLE is to enhance predictability, support continuous improvement, and provide transparency for both the team and stakeholders regarding delivery timelines.

  **Key Topics:**  
  - Definition and calculation of SLE using historical cycle time data  
  - The two components of SLE: elapsed time range and probability (e.g., “85% of items completed in 8 days or less”)  
  - Use of SLE to identify flow issues and trigger inspection and adaptation  
  - Guidance for establishing an initial SLE when historical data is unavailable  
  - The importance of making the SLE transparent to all team members and stakeholders  
  - The relationship between SLE and Sprint length, with emphasis on keeping SLE shorter than the Sprint  
  - The role of SLE in improving predictability, managing stakeholder expectations, and supporting continuous improvement  
  - References to authoritative sources such as the Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams and works by Daniel Vacanti, Donald Reinertsen, and other recognised experts

  **Strict Exclusions:**  
  - Do not include general discussions of service level agreements (SLAs) or non-agile contractual commitments  
  - Exclude content that discusses cycle time, lead time, or flow metrics without direct reference to SLE  
  - Do not include unrelated Kanban, Scrum, or DevOps practices unless they specifically pertain to SLE  
  - Exclude misinterpretations or uses of SLE outside the context of Agile, Scrum, or Kanban theory as defined by original sources

  Only classify content here if it directly addresses the definition, calculation, application, or improvement of Service Level Expectation (SLE) within Agile, Scrum, or Kanban frameworks.

  title: 'Service Level Expectation (SLE): Forecasting Reliable Delivery with Data-Driven Predictability'
  subtitle: Forecasting delivery timelines and flow reliability using historical cycle time data to set transparent expectations, drive improvement, and manage stakeholder confidence
  content: Forecasting delivery timelines using historical cycle time data, Service Level Expectation enables teams to set transparent, probabilistic commitments for work item completion. Topics include cycle time analysis, flow efficiency, stakeholder communication, continuous improvement, and adapting expectations based on empirical evidence to enhance predictability and responsiveness within iterative workflows.

abstract: "A Service Level Expectation (SLE) is a forecast used by Scrum Teams to estimate the time it should take for a work item to move from initiation to completion within their workflow. Originating from practices that combine elements of Scrum and Kanban, the SLE is defined by two components: a specific range of elapsed days and the probability that work items will be completed within that timeframe, such as stating that 85 percent of items should be finished in eight days or less. The SLE is calculated using the team's historical cycle time data, which measures how long work items have taken to complete in the past. If such data is not yet available, teams are encouraged to make an informed estimate and refine it as more data becomes available. The SLE is made transparent to all team members and stakeholders, serving as a tool for identifying flow issues and prompting inspection and adaptation when expectations are not met. In agile and DevOps contexts, the SLE is valuable because it enhances predictability, supports continuous improvement, and helps teams manage stakeholder expectations by providing a clear, data-driven understanding of delivery timelines. Keeping the SLE shorter than the length of a Sprint further improves the team's ability to deliver reliably and respond to change."

A Service Level Expectation (SLE) forecasts how long it should take a given item to flow from start to finish within the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Team's Workflow. The [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) uses its SLE to find active flow issues and to inspect and adapt in cases of falling below those expectations.

The SLE itself has two parts: a range of elapsed days and a probability associated with that period (e.g., 85% of work items should be finished in eight days or less). The SLE should be based on the Scrum Team's historical [Cycle Time]({{< ref "/tags/cycle-time" >}}), and once calculated, the Scrum Team should make it transparent. If no historical Cycle Time data exists, the Scrum Team should make its best guess and then inspect and adapt once there is enough historical data to do a proper SLE calculation.

A reasonable SLE should be less than your Sprint length and shorter improves predictability.
