description: Team performance is a systemic indicator of how well a team consistently delivers value, reflecting its collaborative and technical delivery capability over time.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this tag for content focused on delivery capability at the team level.**  
  Team performance describes a team's ability to consistently produce meaningful outcomes within its system of work. It is evaluated using delivery metrics and system behaviours that reflect how effectively the team functions.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Interpreting team performance using system-level metrics
  - Factors that influence performance (structure, roles, WIP, skills)
  - How team dynamics affect sustainable delivery
  - Systemic constraints that impact throughput and quality
  - Patterns and trends in delivery over time

  **Strictly exclude:**  
  - Content focused on individual performance or behaviour  
  - HR evaluation methods  
  - Motivational or cultural principles without systemic evidence

  content: Team performance is a delivery capability that reflects how well a team consistently delivers outcomes over time. This includes analysis of delivery patterns, system constraints, and collaboration effectiveness within the teamâ€™s system of work. Posts should explore how to inspect, measure, and improve team-level throughput, predictability, and value delivery.

eam performance refers to the consistent ability of a team to deliver outcomes through its system of work. It reflects delivery capability over time, as measured by observable patterns in flow, responsiveness, and quality.

Performance emerges from the structure and constraints of the system the team operates within. It is influenced by team composition, collaboration habits, skill alignment, and clarity of purpose. This makes team performance a system-level capability, not an individual or cultural trait.

By evaluating team performance using flow metrics (e.g., throughput, cycle time), retrospectives, and empirical signals, organisations can identify whether teams are improving, stagnating, or constrained by external dependencies. High-performing teams show consistency and adaptability in delivery, even in the face of change.

Improving team performance is a matter of system design: limiting work in progress, refining collaboration patterns, and improving visibility into blockers. This systemic lens ensures improvements are sustainable and repeatable across the organisation.
