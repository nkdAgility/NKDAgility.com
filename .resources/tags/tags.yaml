    title: Working Software
    abstract: Working Software is a fundamental artifact in Agile, Scrum, and Lean frameworks, serving as the tangible output of a team's efforts throughout the development process. It emerges from iterative development cycles and acts as a demonstration of progress and value delivery. In Scrum, working software is the primary success metric for each Sprint, encapsulated in the Increment artifact, which is subject to inspection and adaptation based on stakeholder feedback. The Definition of Done ensures that the software meets established quality criteria, making it valuable and ready for release. The importance of working software lies in its ability to provide a concrete measure of progress, aligning teams and stakeholders around completed work and remaining tasks. It transcends mere code, representing deliverables that address real-world needs and customer expectations, thereby maintaining a focus on value delivery. In agile methodologies, the emphasis on working software fosters continuous feedback and improvement, enabling teams to release increments iteratively and adapt to evolving requirements. This focus enhances collaboration, increases transparency, and drives ongoing improvement within organisations. Ultimately, working software is not solely about technical execution; it is about consistently delivering value, responding to customer needs, and ensuring long-term sustainability, thereby contributing to customer satisfaction, innovation, and overall business success.

    **Test First** is a modern engineering practice that anchors the delivery of working software in clarity, confidence, and quality. It is a shift-left strategy where tests are defined *before* implementation begins, guiding design and enabling faster feedback loops.

    At its core, Test First, as a practice, promotes defining success criteria upfront—whether through examples, scenarios, specifications, or executable tests. This clarity ensures that teams understand what “good” looks like before they write any code or build any components.

    ### Dual Support: Manual and Automated

    Test First applies to both **manual and automated validation**:

    - **Manual Test First** practices include defining acceptance criteria, visual specifications, and test cases before development. This enables effective collaboration between developers, testers, designers, and product owners.
    - **Automated Test First** (such as TDD or ATDD) takes it further by encoding those criteria in executable tests—written before the implementation. These tests drive design, expose ambiguity, and provide a safety net for change.

    While manual testing has its place in exploratory and usability validation, **automation is preferred**. It enables fast feedback, supports continuous integration, and reduces the risk of regressions. In mature teams, manual Test First practices are often transitional scaffolding toward full automation.

    ### Test First is Not Just a Testing Practice

    Test First is a **design practice**, a **collaboration practice**, and a **feedback practice**. It improves flow by reducing rework, aligning expectations early, and ensuring that development efforts are always grounded in real customer outcomes.

    In teams using Test First well, tests are not written to prove code works—they’re written to define what “working” means.

    title: Test Driven Development
    abstract: Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that prioritises the creation of automated tests prior to writing the actual code. Originating from the need for a structured approach to software design, TDD ensures that development is guided by the requirements specified in the tests, which clarifies the intended functionality of the software. This practice is crucial in the context of Agile and DevOps as it promotes a culture of quality and accountability, allowing teams to deliver consistent and sustainable value. By embedding testing into the development lifecycle from the beginning, TDD significantly reduces the risk of defects and simplifies the process of refactoring, with tests acting as a safety net. The long-term advantages of TDD extend beyond immediate improvements in code quality; it fosters a mindset of continuous improvement and adaptability among team members. This approach aligns seamlessly with Agile principles, enhancing collaboration and responsiveness to change while supporting technical excellence. By focusing on test coverage, teams can confidently introduce new features and enhancements, ensuring that existing functionalities remain intact. Ultimately, TDD not only improves individual projects but also cultivates a culture of reliability and trust within the organisation, leading to better outcomes for stakeholders and customers.

    title: Social Technologies
    abstract: Social technologies refer to foundational philosophies that enhance adaptability, emergent coordination, and collective intelligence in complex environments characterised by high variance. Unlike traditional methodologies that prescribe specific processes, social technologies provide a framework for decision-making that emphasises continuous learning, self-management, and decentralised authority. This approach allows organisations to navigate uncertainty with intention rather than relying on rigid procedures. Key principles include self-organisation, which promotes decentralised structures over hierarchical control; empirical inquiry, which prioritises iterative learning and experimentation; and collective intelligence, which recognises work as a social process driven by shared understanding. The importance of these philosophies lies in their ability to foster fluidity and resilience within organisations, enabling them to adapt to change and innovate effectively. By cultivating a social technology ethos—embracing epistemic humility, fostering emergent order, promoting participatory governance, and committing to continuous sense-making—organisations can transform their approach to complexity. This shift not only enhances collaboration and value creation but also positions adaptability as an intrinsic aspect of organisational culture, ultimately driving continuous progress in product development and operational effectiveness.

    In complex environments where variance is high, methodologies fall short. In order to guide our ways of working we need foundational philosophies that foster adaptability, emergent coordination, and collective intelligence. Social technologies provide this foundation, shaping interactions, decision-making, and value creation.

    Social technologies are not methodologies, they dont tell you how to do the work, but they do provide a structure within which decisions are made. They focus on the underlying principals of continuous learning, self-management, and decentralised decision-making. This enabled organisations to navigate uncertainty with intent, rather than rigid processes. They thrive on:

    - **Self-Organisation & Complexity** – Work thrives in decentralised, adaptive structures rather than hierarchical control.
    - **Empirical Inquiry & Pragmatism** – Emphasises iterative learning, observation, and experimentation over assumptions.
    - **Collective Intelligence & Social Constructivism** – Work is a social process where shared understanding drives innovation.

    ### Why Philosophy, Not Process, Matters

    Processes are transient; philosophies endure. Rigid organisations struggle with change because they impose predictability on complex realities. In contrast, those embracing social technologies cultivate fluidity, making experimentation and sense-making intrinsic to how they operate.

    ### Cultivating a Social Technology Ethos

    1. **Embrace Epistemic Humility** – Knowledge evolves. Encourage inquiry, challenge assumptions, and let insights emerge from practice.
    2. **Foster Emergent Order** – Move beyond hierarchy. Let those closest to the work define their paths within clear guardrails.
    3. **Promote Participatory Governance** – Shift from centralised control to co-creation, where decision-making is owned by those doing the work.
    4. **Commit to Continuous Sense-Making** – Treat work as an evolving set of experiments, refining direction through reflection and learning.

    Organisations that see social technologies as a way of engaging with complexity—not just tools—become resilient, collaborative, and value-driven. Adaptability isn’t a lever to pull; it’s a way of thinking and working that fuels continuous progress.

    title: Site Reliability Engineering
    abstract: Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that utilises software engineering principles to develop scalable and reliable systems, effectively bridging the gap between development and operations. Originating from the need to embed reliability within the software development lifecycle, SRE ensures that systems maintain functionality and resilience under diverse conditions. This methodology prioritises automation, monitoring, and incident response, which allows teams to deliver consistent value in a sustainable manner. SRE teams establish service level objectives (SLOs) and service level indicators (SLIs) to create clear performance and reliability metrics, fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. This proactive approach to problem-solving and engineering solutions to operational challenges enhances overall system performance, distinguishing SRE from traditional operations roles. By promoting shared responsibility for reliability across teams, SRE encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, which not only improves user satisfaction but also drives positive business outcomes. Ultimately, the integration of reliability into the development process supports organisational strategic goals and enhances competitive advantage, making SRE a vital component in agile, DevOps, and product development frameworks.

    Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is not a job title; it is an ethos. It is the disciplined application of software engineering principles to design, build, and operate reliable, scalable systems. And it is essential if you want to survive modern software delivery.

    SRE builds resilience by design, not by accident. It makes reliability a first-class product feature: measured, automated, and continuously improved. This ethos aligns perfectly with the Azure DevOps journey — moving from on-premises to SaaS, from two-year release cycles to daily deployments, and from siloed development to integrated, accountable delivery.

    With the shift-left movement pushing more operational accountability onto engineering teams, the old excuses no longer work. Feature teams can no longer shrug and say, “Ops will handle it.” They own their live site experience end-to-end — from ideation to validation, from code to customer.

    Here’s what that demands:

    - **Transparency**: Teams need visibility into what’s happening in production. Not vague guesses, but hard telemetry. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are non-negotiable. If you can’t see it, you can’t manage it.
    - **Telemetry**: Instrument everything. Capture user-facing metrics, not just server uptime. Focus on failed or slow user minutes. That’s what customers feel. That’s what matters.
    - **On-Call Discipline**: Resilience is not about heroism; it’s about system design. But when incidents happen, teams must be ready. That means practiced, well-understood on-call rotations, pre-delegated authority, and rehearsed recovery plans. Top-down control is a liability in a crisis. Empowered teams move fast.
    - **Feature Team Protection**: While feature teams own their work, they cannot be buried under endless incident noise. SRE practices like progressive rollouts, feature toggles, circuit breakers, and automated rollback are critical. They let teams learn from production without drowning in it.

    The Azure DevOps Services team learned this the hard way. Moving from a monolithic, on-premises delivery model to SaaS forced a fundamental rethink. They didn’t just automate pipelines. They embedded a production-first mindset, shifting quality left, closing feedback loops, and treating resilience as part of the Definition of Done.

    Their key lessons:

    - **Automate everything**: Deployments, rollbacks, recoveries — no heroics, just engineering.
    - **Iterate over pain**: If something hurts, do it more often until it stops hurting.
    - **Build for failure**: Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, progressive delivery — resilience by design, not by wish.
    - **Treat resilience as an investment**: Downtime kills trust. Outages cost revenue. Slow recovery erodes morale. Resilience pays for itself.

    SRE and DevOps together deliver continuous value. DevOps brings the union of people, process, and products; SRE ensures that union runs reliably under real-world stress. This is not about vanity metrics or theatre. It is about evidence-based management — metrics like Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), deployment frequency, and customer satisfaction that tell you whether your resilience investments are delivering.

    Bottom line: if your teams are not actively designing, measuring, and improving resilience, you are not running a serious engineering organisation. You are just hoping you survive the next failure.

    Stop hoping. Start engineering.

    abstract: "A Service Level Expectation (SLE) is a forecast used by Scrum Teams to estimate the time it should take for a work item to move from initiation to completion within their workflow. Originating from practices that combine elements of Scrum and Kanban, the SLE is defined by two components: a specific range of elapsed days and the probability that work items will be completed within that timeframe, such as stating that 85 percent of items should be finished in eight days or less. The SLE is calculated using the team's historical cycle time data, which measures how long work items have taken to complete in the past. If such data is not yet available, teams are encouraged to make an informed estimate and refine it as more data becomes available. The SLE is made transparent to all team members and stakeholders, serving as a tool for identifying flow issues and prompting inspection and adaptation when expectations are not met. In agile and DevOps contexts, the SLE is valuable because it enhances predictability, supports continuous improvement, and helps teams manage stakeholder expectations by providing a clear, data-driven understanding of delivery timelines. Keeping the SLE shorter than the length of a Sprint further improves the team's ability to deliver reliably and respond to change."

    A Service Level Expectation (SLE) forecasts how long it should take a given item to flow from start to finish within the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Team's Workflow. The [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) uses its SLE to find active flow issues and to inspect and adapt in cases of falling below those expectations.

    The SLE itself has two parts: a range of elapsed days and a probability associated with that period (e.g., 85% of work items should be finished in eight days or less). The SLE should be based on the Scrum Team's historical [Cycle Time]({{< ref "/tags/cycle-time" >}}), and once calculated, the Scrum Team should make it transparent. If no historical Cycle Time data exists, the Scrum Team should make its best guess and then inspect and adapt once there is enough historical data to do a proper SLE calculation.

    A reasonable SLE should be less than your Sprint length and shorter improves predictability.

    title: Sensemaking
    abstract: Sensemaking is the process by which organisations interpret complex information and situations to make informed decisions, involving data gathering, pattern recognition, and insight derivation. This capability is particularly valuable in environments marked by rapid change and uncertainty, as it enables teams to respond effectively to challenges and opportunities. By cultivating a culture of sensemaking, organisations can enhance their ability to deliver value in a predictable and sustainable manner, as teams become skilled at understanding customer needs, market dynamics, and internal capabilities, thereby aligning their efforts with strategic objectives. Unlike methodologies such as Agile Planning or Continuous Improvement, which focus on specific practices, sensemaking serves as a foundational framework that supports these initiatives by ensuring decisions are informed by a comprehensive understanding of the context. This long-term, enabling nature of sensemaking is essential for organisational agility, fostering continuous learning and innovation at all levels. By integrating sensemaking into daily operations, teams can better anticipate challenges and seize opportunities, ultimately improving their performance and adaptability in a complex landscape.

    title: Scrum Master
    abstract: "The Scrum Master is a pivotal role within the Scrum framework, serving as a change agent who empowers Scrum Teams and their organisations to enhance their work processes and deliver value effectively. Originating from the principles of agile methodology, the Scrum Master actively fosters an environment conducive to self-management, empirical decision-making, and sustainable delivery, rather than merely facilitating meetings. This role encompasses three critical domains: technical mastery, which involves a deep understanding of the team's operational context, including practices like Test-Driven Development and DevOps; business mastery, which focuses on helping the Product Owner clarify vision and prioritise the backlog; and organisational mastery, where the Scrum Master advocates for structural changes and coaches the organisation towards agility. The importance of the Scrum Master lies in their ability to drive continuous improvement and challenge ineffective practices, ensuring that Scrum is not just a set of rituals but a transformative approach to product development. Their effectiveness is measured by the outcomes achieved rather than the processes followed, highlighting their essential contribution to fostering a culture of agility and innovation within organisations. Without a skilled Scrum Master, the potential of Scrum may be diminished, reducing it to mere formality rather than a catalyst for meaningful change."

    The Scrum Master is an accountability in Scrum.

    A **Scrum Master** is a **change agent** who enables a Scrum Team and its surrounding organisation to improve their system of work and deliver value professionally. Far from a passive facilitator, the Scrum Master is accountable for the **effectiveness of the Scrum Team**, actively shaping the conditions that enable empiricism, self-management, and sustainable delivery.

    Scrum is a **social technology** for solving complex problems. The Scrum Master ensures it is understood and enacted, not just followed.

    To fulfil this accountability, the Scrum Master must **teach, coach, mentor, and facilitate**—choosing the right stance at the right time to help the Scrum Team, Product Owner, and organisation evolve. This demands more than textbook Scrum. It requires **mastery across three critical domains**:

    ### 1. **Technical Mastery**

    A Scrum Master must understand the domain in which their team operates. For software teams, this includes:

    - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    - CI/CD and DevOps
    - SOLID principles and Clean Code
    - Infrastructure as Code and automated testing
    - Observability and telemetry

    Without technical fluency, they cannot guide the team towards engineering excellence or challenge ineffective practices.

    ### 2. **Business Mastery**

    They help the Product Owner maximise value by supporting:

    - Vision and Product Goal clarity
    - Backlog transparency and evidence-based prioritisation
    - Outcome-focused planning
    - Effective stakeholder engagement

    A Scrum Master without business context cannot mentor product strategy or drive real outcomes.

    ### 3. **Organisational Mastery**

    Scrum exposes organisational dysfunction. The Scrum Master:

    - Advocates for structural change
    - Influences leadership
    - Coaches towards agility
    - Removes systemic impediments

    They don’t wait for permission to lead change. They cause it.

    ---

    The Scrum Master is not a delivery manager, Jira admin, or meeting scheduler. They are a **lean-agile practitioner** accountable for enabling **continuous improvement, empirical decision-making**, and **value delivery**. Their impact is measured in outcomes, not ceremonies.

    Without a capable Scrum Master, Scrum risks becoming theatre. With one, it becomes a lever for transformation.

    title: Scaling
    abstract: Scaling refers to the capacity of an organisation to effectively coordinate multiple teams in the delivery of complex products while maintaining agility. This concept originates from the need to align efforts, optimise workflow, and enhance value delivery across the enterprise. It is particularly important in the contexts of agile methodologies and DevOps, as it allows organisations to respond swiftly to market changes without compromising on quality or speed. By implementing lean principles and adaptive product structures, scaling promotes a cohesive approach to product development, enabling teams to operate autonomously while remaining aligned with broader business objectives. This alignment is crucial for maximising efficiency and minimising waste, thereby leveraging the organisation's collective capabilities. Furthermore, scaling fosters a culture of continuous improvement, where feedback loops and collaboration are integral to the development process. By prioritising these aspects, organisations can achieve sustainable growth and deliver value consistently, enhancing their competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment. Ultimately, scaling is not just about increasing size but about establishing a robust framework that supports innovation and responsiveness throughout the organisation.

    title: Revenue per Employee
    abstract: Revenue per Employee is a crucial observability metric that measures an organisation's financial efficiency by calculating total revenue divided by the number of employees. This metric provides valuable insights into how effectively an organisation converts its workforce capacity into revenue, allowing for the analysis of systemic performance rather than focusing on individual contributions. It serves as a financial signal that facilitates empirical examination of workforce alignment, throughput, and productivity trends over time. When utilised appropriately, Revenue per Employee aids in strategic planning, identifies delivery constraints, and assesses the operational impact of organisational changes, such as the adoption of Agile methodologies or Lean transformations. By monitoring this metric over time, organisations can uncover the effects of restructuring, automation, or changes in team composition. Although it is not a diagnostic tool on its own, it plays a significant role in a broader set of delivery and business metrics, enabling leaders to evaluate the performance of their systems. This perspective positions Revenue per Employee as a lens through which to understand system health, rather than as a means of assessing individual or team accountability.

    title: Product Validation
    abstract: Product validation is the process of testing product ideas with actual users to confirm that they meet market demands and provide real customer value. This practice is essential for organisations seeking to develop products that connect with their target audience, as it reduces the risk of investing in features or solutions that do not meet user expectations. By involving users early and frequently, teams can collect feedback that informs design and functionality, facilitating iterative enhancements that improve product-market fit. The importance of product validation lies in its capacity to enable teams to deliver value in a predictable and sustainable manner, fostering a culture of experimentation and learning where assumptions are validated through real-world data rather than theoretical models. This not only speeds up the development process but also increases the likelihood of product success in a competitive environment. Additionally, product validation is a long-term, systemic practice that aligns well with agile methodologies, lean principles, and DevOps practices. It promotes cross-functional collaboration and empowers teams to make informed decisions based on user insights, ultimately driving continuous improvement and innovation. By prioritising validation, organisations can establish a strong feedback loop that enhances their adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing market.

    The **One Engineering System (1ES)** is a strategic approach to unifying engineering tools and practices across teams to reduce friction, foster collaboration, and enable consistency at scale. It’s about creating a shared engineering backbone that allows teams to move faster and more predictably by removing the chaos of disconnected toolchains and ad hoc workflows.

    At its core, 1ES is not about enforcing a single toolset but about aligning teams around a **common set of engineering standards** that streamline how work gets done—from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and supporting software in production. This shared foundation reduces cognitive overhead, simplifies integration across teams, and makes it easier to deliver high-quality, reliable outcomes.

    A successful 1ES strategy recognises that **tools must serve the way teams work**, not the other way around. Each team should be empowered to adapt their workflows within the shared system, leveraging the strengths of the chosen tools without being constrained by rigid implementations. It’s not about uniformity; it’s about coherence.

    Implementing 1ES requires more than tooling changes—it demands **investment in enablement**. Teams need guidance, training, and support to adopt the system effectively. When done well, 1ES creates the conditions for scalable engineering excellence: clear communication, consistent processes, and a resilient development lifecycle across the organisation.

    title: Modern Source Control
    abstract: Modern source control is a critical practice in software development that focuses on version control and branching strategies to manage codebase changes effectively. Originating from the need for collaborative coding, it utilises systems like Git to allow multiple developers to work simultaneously without conflicts, while also enabling the tracking of modifications, reverting to previous states, and maintaining a comprehensive development history. This practice is vital as it enhances a team's ability to deliver value in a predictable and sustainable manner, facilitating the implementation of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that promote rapid feedback and reduced lead times. Such agility empowers organisations to swiftly adapt to market demands and customer feedback, fostering innovation. Additionally, modern source control encourages a systematic approach to development through branching strategies, such as feature branches or trunk-based development, which support parallel workstreams and minimise disruptions to the main codebase. This not only improves collaboration but also helps in managing technical debt by allowing teams to isolate and resolve issues more efficiently. By integrating these practices into their workflows, organisations can cultivate a resilient development environment that prioritises quality and efficiency, ultimately contributing to long-term success in product delivery.

    **Lead Time** is a critical **observability metric** that measures the time taken from the initiation of a work item to its delivery to the customer. It is a flow-based implementation of **Cycle Time**, commonly used in **Kanban** systems to reflect how long it takes to deliver value end-to-end. While Cycle Time focuses on active processing time within a system, Lead Time includes the full duration from commitment to delivery, providing external visibility into service responsiveness.

    As a cornerstone observability metric, Lead Time contributes to system telemetry by exposing how work flows through delivery systems. It enables teams to correlate systemic delays, variability, or bottlenecks with team dynamics, product complexity, and architectural constraints. Dashboards and monitoring tools often surface Lead Time in near real-time, supporting operational feedback loops, performance transparency, and empirical decision-making.

    Lead Time serves as a signal in the wider observability ecosystem, complementing metrics like **Cycle Time** and **Throughput**. Together, these indicators form a telemetry-based understanding of system health. When tracked continuously, they enable teams to detect emerging delivery patterns, diagnose flow inefficiencies, and respond with data-informed adjustments.

    This metric is particularly important in **Agile**, **Lean**, and **DevOps** environments, where **continuous improvement** is a strategic capability. Shorter Lead Times signal faster feedback loops, improved responsiveness to market needs, and greater organisational resilience.

    In summary, **Lead Time** is not just a measure of elapsed time. It is a leading indicator of system performance, delivery predictability, and responsiveness. When embedded into observability practices, Lead Time becomes a diagnostic tool that empowers teams to optimise flow, accelerate value delivery, and sustain high-performance ways of working.

    title: Hybrid Agile
    abstract: Hybrid Agile refers to the practice of integrating agile methodologies into existing project management frameworks, often with the aim of achieving greater flexibility while maintaining a sense of control. This approach is commonly adopted by organisations that seek to enhance their project delivery processes but frequently results in ineffective outcomes. Instead of successfully merging the advantages of agile practices with traditional governance structures, Hybrid Agile often leads to a scenario where the rigidity of conventional methods undermines the intended agility, creating a situation described as the "worst of both worlds." This concept highlights the challenges faced by delivery teams that encounter conflicting expectations, as leadership may cling to fixed plans while reducing agile roles to mere ceremonial functions rather than fostering genuine accountability. The persistence of command-and-control mindsets, coupled with the superficial adoption of agile terminology, creates a disconnect between the intended agile principles and the actual organisational structure. As such, Hybrid Agile is not a sustainable long-term solution; it can erode trust, hinder timely feedback, and perpetuate dysfunction within teams. This analysis serves to critique ineffective hybrid implementations and underscores the necessity for coherent systems of work that prioritise true agility over tactical compromises.

    **Hybrid Agile** is a label frequently used by organisations attempting to bolt agile practices onto project structures. The intention may be to gain flexibility without losing perceived control, but the outcome is rarely effective. Instead of blending strengths, Hybrid Agile often produces the **worst of both worlds**: rigid governance with the illusion of agility.

    This tag should be used to surface critical analysis and evidence of failed hybrid implementations—where delivery teams face conflicting expectations, leadership clings to fixed plans, and agile roles are reduced to ceremonies rather than empowered accountability.

    Hybrid Agile tends to preserve command-and-control thinking while adopting agile language, creating a mismatch between **intent and structure**. It is not a viable long-term strategy. At best, it’s a transitional state. At worst, it erodes trust, delays feedback, and locks in dysfunction.

    Use this tag to challenge weak or diluted implementations and highlight the need for **coherent systems of work** rather than tactical compromises.

    Too many organisations talk about being agile, but they’re still flying blind. Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a strategy to fix that. It’s not a framework, a methodology, or a tool. It’s a way to stop pretending we’re improving and start proving it.

    EBM gives us a structure for inspecting how well we're delivering value and where to invest next. It’s built around four key areas:

    1. **Current Value** – Are we delivering value now, or are we just burning cash? Customer satisfaction, revenue per employee, and product usage give us the truth.
    2. **Time to Market** – How fast can we learn, deliver, and respond to change? Cycle time, release frequency, and time spent stabilising releases tell us whether we’re built for speed or for bureaucracy.
    3. **Ability to Innovate** – Can we create new value, or are we buried under technical debt and bloated backlogs? Look at innovation rate, feature usage, and how much of the product is actually used.
    4. **Unrealised Value** – What’s the opportunity cost of staying the same? If we had fewer constraints, where could we win?

    These aren’t vanity metrics. They’re signals that help leaders make real decisions about where to focus, where to invest, and what to stop doing. You don’t need a prescription. You need clarity, direction, and feedback.

    EBM enables an empirical approach to strategic improvement. It’s not about tracking everything. It’s about measuring the right things, at the right time, to drive better outcomes. If you're not using data to improve how you deliver value, then you're not doing agility. You're doing theatre.

    If you want to move beyond output metrics and start managing for outcomes, EBM gives you the scaffolding to do that—without pretending there’s a silver bullet. It’s messy. It’s iterative. But it works.

    Evidence Based Leadership is a strategic approach that utilises empirical data to inform decision-making and drive improvements within an organisation. This concept is crucial for fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, enabling leaders to make informed choices that align with the organisation's goals and the needs of its teams. By relying on measurable outcomes and real-time feedback, leaders can identify what works, what doesn’t, and why, thus facilitating a more adaptive and responsive organisational environment.

    This approach empowers teams to deliver value predictably and sustainably by creating a framework where decisions are grounded in evidence rather than intuition or tradition. It encourages continuous learning and adaptation, allowing organisations to respond effectively to changing market conditions and customer needs. Evidence Based Leadership also promotes a long-term perspective, focusing on systemic improvements that enhance overall performance and resilience.

    By integrating data-driven insights into leadership practices, organisations can cultivate a culture of experimentation and innovation, where teams feel supported to test hypotheses and learn from their experiences. This not only enhances team motivation and engagement but also drives a more effective alignment between strategic objectives and operational execution, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and value delivery.

    title: Estimation
    abstract: Estimation is a fundamental practice within Agile and Scrum methodologies that allows teams to predict the effort and time necessary to complete tasks or deliver features. Originating from the need to manage uncertainty in project management, estimation employs empirical data and collaborative techniques to align stakeholder expectations and foster a shared understanding of project scope and timelines. This practice transcends mere numerical assignment; it involves engaging the entire team in discussions that utilise collective knowledge and experience, thereby enhancing both accuracy and team buy-in. Effective estimation is crucial as it enables teams to deliver value in a predictable and sustainable manner, facilitating improved planning and resource allocation. It also supports continuous improvement through a feedback loop that compares past estimates with actual outcomes, refining future forecasting. This iterative process promotes a culture of transparency and accountability, which is vital for high-performing teams. Unlike broader concepts such as Agile Planning or Backlog Refinement, estimation focuses on the tactical execution of tasks, serving as a foundational element for successful Agile practices. By incorporating estimation into their workflows, organisations can improve their agility and responsiveness in a rapidly changing market, ultimately leading to better outcomes for customers and stakeholders.

    title: Definition of Ready
    abstract: Definition of Ready (DoR) is a concept within the Scrum framework that outlines the criteria necessary for a Backlog Item to be considered ready for implementation by the development team. It emerges from the collaborative understanding among Developers, the Product Owner, and Stakeholders regarding what is required to proceed with a Backlog Item. The importance of DoR lies in its potential to enhance clarity and alignment within agile teams, yet it also presents challenges, such as creating a false sense of readiness, neglecting the need for ongoing refinement, and leading to misconceptions about its equivalence with the Definition of Done (DoD). Unlike the DoD, which is an absolute measure of completion, the subjective nature of DoR can result in partial implementation, risking the integrity of the development process. To mitigate these issues, it is suggested that teams adopt a more nuanced approach to defining readiness, ensuring that each Backlog Item meets specific criteria, such as having a clear outcome, hypothesis, and telemetry for evaluation. The INVEST criteria further guide the formulation of Product Backlog Items, emphasising their independence, negotiability, value, estimability, size, and testability. Ultimately, a well-defined DoR fosters effective communication and understanding within agile teams, contributing to successful product development and organisational design.

  BodyContent: |
    Definition of Ready (DoR) is an artifact.

    From the perspective of Scrum, the idea of Ready, as applied to a Backlog Item, represents everyone's (Developers, Product Owner, & Stakeholders) understanding of what is needed to implement that Backlog Item. Since this is subjective and not objective, having a definition of what constitutes ready is not possible.

    The danger of having a defined definition of Ready (DoR) is:

    - **False sense of Ready** - First that it creates a false sense of Ready that encompasses the objective points that we can focus on, but misses the subjective. This can lead to false gating, where participants hold each other accountable for failing to achieve something that was not defined in the first place.
    - **Neglecting Refinement** - If things are "ready" then why would we have to understand it better!
    - **False Equivalence with DoD** - Using the DoR terminology generally leads participants to feel that the DoD and the DoR have an equivalence. This is dangerous as the DoD is an absolute boolean proposition, while the subjective nature of the DoR may lead it to be only partially implemented. If it's OK to only partially achieve the DoR, the logical fallacy is that the DoD can also be partially implemented.

    A solution that may enable the effective use of this practice may be to a different formula of naming to create disambiguation between the DoR and the DoD.

    ## Backlog Candidacy Test

    Every candidate Backlog Item should have:

    - has a clear outcome or objective.
    - contains a clear hypothesis.
    - defignes clear telemetry to be collected.

    Once candidacy is achieved then the Team & Stakehodlers can determin Ready with conversation.

    ## Rule of Thumb

    _As a general rule Developers should not take Backlog Item into a Sprint that they do not fully understand and agree, as a team, that there is a reasonable likelihood of being successful._

    ## INVEST

    - I (Independent). The PBI should be self-contained and it should be possible to bring it into progress without a dependency upon another PBI or an external resource.
    - N (Negotiable). A good PBI should leave room for discussion regarding its optimal implementation.
    - V (Valuable). The value a PBI delivers to stakeholders should be clear.
    - E (Estimable). A PBI must have a size relative to other PBIs.
    - S (Small). PBIs should be small enough to estimate with reasonable accuracy and to plan into a time-box such as a Sprint.
    - T (Testable). Each PBI should have clear acceptance criteria which allow its satisfaction to be tested.

    title: Definition of Done
    subtitle: Getting Started with the Definition of Done (DoD)
    ResourceId: mAZrKmLwc3L
    abstract: The Definition of Done (DoD) is a critical framework that establishes a shared understanding of what constitutes a completed and releasable product increment within agile and DevOps environments. Originating from the need for clarity in product development, the DoD serves as an organisational standard that all teams must adhere to, ensuring that every increment meets minimum quality criteria before it can be considered complete. This framework is vital for fostering transparency and consistency across teams, enabling empirical decision-making based on real-world feedback. By defining specific criteria—such as deployment in production, telemetry collection, and validation of initial hypotheses—the DoD helps mitigate risks associated with incomplete or subpar work, thereby reducing technical debt and enhancing the overall quality of deliverables. Furthermore, it facilitates faster feedback loops and iterative learning, allowing teams to adapt their processes based on actual performance data. The DoD not only clarifies expectations for stakeholders but also protects the integrity of the product, ensuring that increments are valuable, verifiable, and ready for real-world use. In essence, the Definition of Done is foundational to maintaining high standards in product development, promoting alignment among teams, and ultimately driving successful outcomes in organisational design and delivery.

    Every team should define what is required, what criteria must be met, for a product [increment]({{< ref "/tags/increment" >}}) to be considered releasable. A [definition of done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}}). If the organization has not articulated a specific standard, or set of criteria, then the team should create a definition of done that is appropriate for the product. The work produced must comply with the definition of done for it to be considered usable, and if there are multiple teams working on a single product, then those teams must agree on a definition of done and ensure that all teams honour that standard.
    {: .lead}

    Developers needs to decide what Done means within the organisational context and the product domain. They need to sit down and create a list of things that must be true for every Increment of software that they deliver. [Working Software]({{< ref "/tags/working-software" >}}) is not specific to a PBI; it’s applied regardless of PBI to the entire delivery.

    > “The Definition of Done creates [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a [Product Backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) item does not meet the Definition of > > Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the [Sprint Review]({{< ref "/tags/sprint-review" >}}). Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.”\\
    > --<cite>[The 2020 Scrum Guide]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}})</cite>

    If you can’t ship working software at least every 30 days then by its very definition, you are not yet doing [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}). Since [Professional Scrum Teams build software that works]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2020/2020-12-03-professional-scrum-teams-build-software-works" >}}), stop, create a working increment of software that meets your definition of done (DoD), and then start Sprinting, and review what you mean by “working” continuously, and at least on a regular cadence.

    **The purpose of the definition of done is to provide transparency of what has been done!** This provides the team with focus on whats needed and commitment to the minimum level of quality needed. Every team has full control over the level of quality that they provide.

    A clear shared definition of done allows us to:

    1.  Maintain Transparency of what we have Done
    2.  Understand how much work is required to deliver an item
    3.  Create an agreement of what we show at the Sprint Review
    4.  Protect our Brand!

    ## What is Done?

    Done does not reflect the requirements, value, or stories. It is a shared understanding of quality.

    If you were creating a definition of done for a bakery that would make a number of products you would likely like the following to always be true:

    1. Kitchen is clean at time of preparation
    2. All ingredients are fresh
    3. All items cooked to the appropriate temperature.
    4. Each batch taste tested

    This short measurable checklist that reflects quality should be true regardless of what the bakery is creating; baguettes, donuts, or meat pies. All must meet this simple definition of done to be sellable and not risk the customers, its employees, or the business.

    Before you cut a single line of code, you need to decide what done means for your product and your company. It will be defined very differently if you are building firmware for pacemakers or if you are creating an e-commerce portal. Here are some characteristics of a Definition of Done:

    - **A short, measurable checklist** – try and have things on your DoD that can be measured, that you can test the outcome, preferably in an automated fashion.
    - **Mirrors shippable** – While you might not have shipped your product, [although we recommended it](https://nkdagility.com/blog/continuous-deliver-sprint/), you should have that choice. Your [Product Owner]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#product-owner) should be able to say, at the [Sprint Review]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#sprint-review): “That’s Awesome… lets ship it.”.
    - **No further work** – There should be no further work required from the [Developers]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#developers) to ship your product to production. Any additional work means that you were not Done, and it takes away from the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#product-owner) capacity for the next iteration. Ideally, you have a fully automated process for delivering software, and [never use staggered iterations for delivery]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2017/2017-05-17-continuous-deliver-sprint" >}}).

    A simple definition of DOD from Scrum: "a shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})."

    _Your short, measurable checklist that mirrors usable and results in no further work required to ship your product needs to be defined._ A great way to do this is to get the Scrum Team (the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) plus the Developers and any relevant Stakeholders) into a [facilitated DoD Workshop]({{< ref "/resources/workshops/definition-of-done" >}}). Without a Definition of Done we don’t understand what working software means, and without working software we cant have predictable delivery. Your Product Owner can’t reject a Backlog Item, only whether the Increment is working or not.

    No mater what you are building you should have a clear and concise definition of done that can be understood and articulated by the whole Team, and ideally by your stakeholders.

    ## Done Means Releasable

    When the [Product Backlog]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#product-backlog) item or an [Increment]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#increment) is described as Done, everyone must understand what that means. Although this varies significantly per team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete to ensure transparency, the foundation of any empirical system. This is the definition of done for the team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product increment. The same definition guides the developers in knowing how many [Product Backlog items]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#product-backlog) they can select during [Sprint Planning]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#sprint-planning). The purpose of each [Sprint]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#the-sprint) is to deliver [Increments]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}#increment) of releasable functionality that adhere to the team's current definition of done.

    An explicit and concrete definition of done may seem small, but it can be the most critical checkpoint of work. Without a consistent meaning of "Done", we cant know what it takes to get something finished. Conversely, a common definition of done ensures that the increment produced at the end of iteration is of high quality, with minimal defects. The Definition of Done is the soul of Scrum, and mature Developers will resist demonstrating at the Sprint Review (let alone deploying) any increment that is not Done.

    #### Releasable

    A releasable product is one that has been designed, developed and tested and is therefore ready for distribution to anyone in the organisation for review or even to any external stakeholder. This isn't a prototype or a demo-only release. This is ready for production. Adhering to a list of acceptance criteria ensures that the Increment is truly releasable, meaning:

    - All aspects of quality are ready
    - No corners were cut during development
    - All acceptance criteria were met and verified
    - The Product Owner accepts it

    The Product Owner can accept the work at any time during the Sprint. The Sprint Review should not be an "acceptance meeting", but rather an opportunity to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.

    ## My First Definition of Done (DoD)

    Your Definition of Done does not just magically appear, and your software does not magically comply with it once it has been created. Making your Software comply with your definition of done is hard work, and while your definition of done should organically grow, you need to create the seed that you can build on.

    I recommend that you [run a DoD Workshop]({{< ref "/resources/workshops/definition-of-done" >}}) with the entire Scrum Team, and likely some other domain experts or interested parties. If there are _stage gates_ that your software has to pass after Developers are Done, then you need representatives from those gates to participate in the workshop. Regardless of your product you likely need representatives with the following expertise; Code, Test, Security, UX, UI, Architecture, etc. You may have this expertise on your team, or you may need to bring in an expert from your organisation, or even external to your organisation.

    Here is a list of things that you should consider for your DoD:

    - **Quality code base (clean, readable, naming conventions)** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers
    - **Architectural conventions respected** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers
    - **According to design/style guide** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers
    - **Documented** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers
    - **Service levels guaranteed (uptime, performance, response time)** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers
    - **Tested** - Agree with Stakeholder(s) / Developers on the amount of Testing with regard to Integration, Performance, Stability, & Regression

    Ultimately ask your self: *"Would you be happy to release this increment to production and support it? You are on call tonight!"*.

    Whatever Definition of Done you come up with it is unlikely that your entire Product currently meets the criteria. You are not yet doing Scrum. Before you start Sprinting, you need to focus on making sure that your current Increment meets your new Definition of Done. Focus on Quality, which is what the Developers are accountable for, and make sure that your Increment meets that new quality bar before you start. The next Increment can only reach the quality bar of all those that came before do.

    **The Definition of Done is the commitment to quality for the Increment!**

    Create a usable increment that meets your definition of done and then start sprinting. Keeping your software in a working state [will require a modern source control system that provides you with the facility to implement good DevOps]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2017/2017-11-10-getting-started-with-modern-source-control-system-and-devops" >}}) practices.

    ## A Starting Point for any Team

    Some examples of things for a software team to put on their definition of done:

    - **Increment Passes SonarCube checks with no Critical errors** – You will be increasing over time, so maybe you need to say “Code Passes SonarCube checks with no more than 50 Critical errors” then work on it over time.
    - **Increment’s Code Coverage stays the same or gets higher** – Looking at a specific measure, like 90%, of code coverage is a read hearing and tells you nothing of code quality. However, it might be advantageous to monitor and measure for adverse change in code coverage, and we always advocate for TDD practices.
    - **Increment meets agreed engineering standards** – You should decide rules for naming of methods, tests, variables and everything in-between. Start small and add over time. Link to your agreed standards on a Wiki and continuously improve and expand your rules. Automate if possible.
    - **Acceptance Criteria for Increment pass** – Making sure you at least meet the prescribed criteria is a laudable goal and automating them with ATDD practices is even better.
    - **Acceptance Tests for Increment are Automated** – Make sure that you automate all of your tests. If you think something will break, then you should have a test for it.
    - **Security Checks Pass on Increment** – Use an automated tool as part of your build and check for known security vulnerabilities. You will not find all of your security issues, but at least don’t do things we know to be reflective of poor Security.
    - **Increment meets agreed UX standards** – Again, have a Wiki page and make sure that you check it twice. If you are not using an automated DoD entry, then you need to agree as a Team that you have met the criteria.
    - **Increment meets agreed Architectural Guidelines** – Wiki’s are fantastic for this, but automate what you can.

    There are 4 key layers to your DOD that you should consider:

    1.  **Meets organizational DOD** - what is minimum quality level required by your organization to protect its brand and reputation.
    2.  **Meets Practice DOD** - Your practice may add additional elements to DONE based on the technical domain within which you are working.
    3.  **Meets Customer DOD** - Additional quality standards required by the customer.
    4.  **Your Teams DOD** - Run a DOD workshop to identify what you need from 1,2, & 3 as well as anything that your Scrum Team feels that they need to add.

    ## Growing your Definition of Done (DoD)

    It’s super important that quality is always increasing, and that means that you will need to at least reflect on your Definition of Done on a regular cadence. In Scrum, this cadence is defined by your Sprint length, and you have a Kaizen moment at the Sprint Retrospective. That does not mean that you don’t reflect on your DOD all the time, you do. You reflect continuously on whether your increment currently meets your DoD, and what youd need to do to get it there. You should always be reflecting on whether your DoD fits your needs. If your Developers finds that something is missing from the DoD halfway through the Sprint, then they should go ahead and add it, making sure that they are not endangering the Sprint Goal.

    You may discover that you have a performance problem with your product as David Corbin pointed out in my previous post. How do we make sure that we fix that issue? As I see it there are two pieces to this once you are in flight. You can Scrumble (stop Sprinting because of poor quality), and fix it, or you can integrate this new knowledge into your product cycle.

    If it is a significant issue that results in you not having working software, then you need to stop and fix. In Scrum, this is called a Scrumble, as a reflection that the Developers stumbled because something is missing. You should stop adding new features and create a usable increment before you continue Sprinting and adding new features. Once you have repaired the issue, you can increase your Definition of Done to make sure that all future Increments meet the new requirements.

    If it is less significant, you might want to keep working and add what you need to your Product Backlog. You can then deliver improvements over the next few Sprints that mitigate and then resolve the identified issue. Once you have resolved it, you can then pin the outcome by adding something to your DoD.

    **Always look for ways that you can increase your quality. What does your definition of done look like today?**

    title: Cycle Time
    abstract: Cycle time is a key performance metric that measures the total duration required to complete a unit of work, from initiation to delivery. It is widely used in agile and DevOps methodologies to enhance team efficiency and predictability in value delivery. By monitoring cycle time, organisations can pinpoint bottlenecks, streamline processes, and optimise workflows, which leads to quicker product and service delivery. Understanding cycle time empowers teams to make data-driven decisions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and enabling better forecasting and planning based on historical data. This predictability is crucial for aligning stakeholder expectations and meeting customer needs promptly. Furthermore, cycle time promotes a holistic view of value delivery, encouraging teams to consider the entire workflow rather than focusing on individual tasks. By minimising cycle time, organisations can improve their responsiveness to market dynamics and customer feedback, thereby gaining a competitive edge. In an era where rapid and sustainable value delivery is essential, the emphasis on cycle time is vital for organisational success.

    Continuous Improvement is a **first principle** of Business Agility, essential for any organisation seeking resilience and sustainable success in today's complex and rapidly evolving markets. It represents an ongoing commitment to reflecting on outcomes, evaluating performance through empirical evidence, and rapidly adapting strategies based on what is learned. Rather than being a one-time initiative, Continuous Improvement becomes part of the organisational ethos, guiding leaders and teams toward more effective, responsive, and adaptive ways of working.

    This principle underpins an organisation’s ability to respond swiftly to market shifts and customer needs. It encourages proactive experimentation and embraces a disciplined approach to decision-making grounded in real data and experiences. By embedding Continuous Improvement into their core culture, organisations foster environments that not only embrace change but leverage it as a competitive advantage, consistently driving greater value and innovation.

    ### Continuous Improvement in Lean

    Lean thinking places Continuous Improvement at its core through the philosophy of "Kaizen," which emphasises small, regular, and incremental improvements. Lean organisations actively seek out and eliminate waste, optimising their processes to maximise customer value. Continuous Improvement in Lean involves engaging every team member at every level to suggest and implement improvements, creating a culture of collective ownership and constant learning. By embracing this principle, Lean organisations ensure they remain agile, efficient, and adaptive in responding to changing business environments.

    ### Continuous Improvement in Scrum

    Scrum explicitly embeds Continuous Improvement as a foundational principle through its structured cycles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Every Sprint provides teams with the opportunity to reflect on outcomes and performance, using empirical evidence to inform their next steps. The Sprint Retrospective is a dedicated event specifically designed to foster continuous reflection, collaborative learning, and incremental enhancements. By making Continuous Improvement explicit, Scrum ensures that teams regularly pause, assess, and adapt—sustaining a disciplined focus on becoming progressively more effective.

    ### Continuous Improvement in Kanban

    In Kanban, Continuous Improvement is driven by visualisation, explicit policies, and workflow optimisation. By clearly visualising the flow of work and making bottlenecks visible, teams naturally uncover areas for improvement. Kanban encourages incremental adjustments rather than disruptive change, emphasising evolutionary rather than revolutionary improvements. Teams leverage metrics such as cycle time, throughput, and flow efficiency to inform data-driven improvements, continuously refining their workflows to increase predictability, reliability, and value delivery.

    Company as a Product (CaaP) is an organisational strategy that positions the entire company as a dynamic product, continuously evolving in response to customer feedback and measurable outcomes. This approach prioritises the alignment of all organisational elements—people, processes, and systems—around delivering value to customers, akin to the iterative nature of product development. By fostering a culture of cross-functional collaboration and experimentation, CaaP enables teams to adapt swiftly to changing market demands and customer needs.

    This concept shifts the focus from traditional hierarchical structures and internal efficiencies to a more fluid, responsive organisational model. It encourages leaders to view their company’s capabilities as malleable, allowing for intentional adjustments that enhance overall performance and customer satisfaction. CaaP promotes a mindset of continuous improvement, where every aspect of the organisation is subject to refinement and innovation, ensuring that the company remains competitive and relevant in a fast-paced environment. By treating the organisation as a product, teams can deliver value predictably and sustainably, creating a resilient framework that supports long-term success and adaptability in an ever-evolving landscape.

    title: Common Goals
    abstract: Common Goals are a foundational principle for effective delivery within organisations, serving to align strategy with execution and ensuring that every decision, Sprint, and line of code contributes to a shared purpose. These goals are not mere aspirational statements; they represent the strategic objectives that unify efforts and connect individual contributions to meaningful outcomes. In the context of agile, DevOps, and product development, understanding and committing to common goals fosters ownership, clarity, and accountability among team members, enabling distributed decision-making and reducing friction in prioritisation. This alignment is crucial for creating adaptive and high-performing systems, as it allows teams to surface misalignments early and make informed trade-offs without waiting for permission. Furthermore, the integration of tactical commitments, such as Product Goals and Sprint Goals, ensures that strategic intent is operationalised at every level of delivery. By maintaining a focus on measurable outcomes and desired impacts, organisations can avoid the pitfalls of busywork and ensure that their efforts are directed towards achieving significant results. Ultimately, common goals provide the necessary framework for teams to understand their role in the larger organisational context, making it imperative for leaders to establish and communicate these objectives clearly.

    Here’s a rewritten version of your text, reframed around **Common Goals** as the first principle:

    ---

    Common Goals are a first principle of effective delivery. They align strategy with execution, enabling every decision, every Sprint, and every line of code to serve a shared purpose. Without them, you don’t have a system—you have disconnected activity.

    At the heart of any effective organisation lies a shared understanding of its **common goals**. These are not aspirational posters or vague mission statements. They are the unifying strategic objectives that guide decisions, focus effort, and connect the daily work of individuals to something that matters.

    When participants and stakeholders understand these goals—and more importantly, how their work contributes to achieving them—alignment happens. This is not a nice-to-have; it's the baseline for creating adaptive, responsive, and high-performing systems of work.

    ### Why Common Goals Matter

    Common goals create the **conditions for ownership**. They give people clarity, and with clarity comes better decisions, better collaboration, and better outcomes. When everyone is working toward the same strategic objectives, it reduces noise. It removes waste. It makes trade-offs visible.

    This isn’t about command-and-control alignment. It’s about enabling distributed decision-making within a shared context. When teams and individuals understand the why behind their work, accountability becomes real.

    Common goals also reduce friction. They allow teams to prioritise without waiting for permission. They surface misalignments early. And they give leaders something concrete to inspect and adapt against.

    ### Strategic Goals Require Tactical Commitment

    Strategic goals are meaningless without action. In effective organisations, strategic intent flows through every level of delivery. This demands **tactical commitment**—clear, observable goals at every level of the system of work.

    In Scrum, we operationalise this through:

    - **Product Goal** – A long-term strategic objective that orients the Product Backlog and defines the value trajectory of the product.
    - **Sprint Goal** – A tactical commitment by the Scrum Team to achieve a coherent outcome within the Sprint.
    - **Nexus Sprint Goal** – In a scaled environment, this ensures multiple teams are delivering toward the same outcome.

    If you’re using **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, these map cleanly to this structure:

    - The **Objective** is the goal.
    - The **Key Results** are how you’ll know if you’re getting there.

    Well-formed goals follow a simple pattern:  
    **“Achieve [measurable outcome] to enable [desired impact]”**

    For example:

    - _“Improve activation rate by 15% to increase first-week retention”_
    - _“Reduce cycle time from 12 to 5 days to improve delivery predictability”_

    This format keeps goals outcome-focused and value-oriented—avoiding the trap of turning goals into task lists.

    Without tactical goals aligned to strategy, you end up with busy teams delivering work that doesn’t matter. Make sure every Sprint goal, product milestone, or OKR traces back to a common organisational purpose.

    ### Summary

    If people don’t know where they’re going, the system will optimise for busywork. Strategic alignment through **Common Goals** ensures that the organisation is not just moving, but moving in the right direction.

    If your team doesn’t know how their work connects to strategic goals, fix that first. Everything else is noise.

    Agnostic Agile is a movement that champions a flexible, context-driven approach to agility, prioritising principles over rigid frameworks. It encourages teams to adapt their methodologies based on specific needs rather than adhering strictly to a single ideology. This pragmatic stance allows practitioners to draw from a variety of approaches, including Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP, fostering an environment where critical thinking and professionalism thrive.

    By focusing on value delivery, Agnostic Agile enables teams to respond effectively to changing circumstances, ensuring that they can deliver value predictably and sustainably. This adaptability is crucial in today’s fast-paced environments, where the ability to pivot and innovate can significantly impact an organisation's success. 

    Agnostic Agile also promotes ethical practices, steering clear of brand loyalty to specific frameworks. This mindset cultivates a culture of continuous improvement and learning, empowering teams to experiment and refine their processes. Ultimately, Agnostic Agile supports a long-term, systemic approach to agility that enhances organisational resilience and effectiveness, making it a vital concept in modern product development and delivery.

    The Agile Product Operating Model (APOM) is a set of principles that combines contemporary product management strategies with agile ways of working, providing organisations with a solid basis for consistently delivering value. It embodies a product ethos, aligning the entire organisation around well-defined and measurable outcomes.

    ## Shifting from Project to Product Ethos

    Project thinking typically centres around fixed milestones and rigid planning, measuring success narrowly by adherence to timelines and budgets. While projects themselves are not necessarily an issue, an over-reliance on a project mindset restricts flexibility, hinders team adaptability, and distracts from a clear and consistent focus on delivering genuine value.

    In contrast, a product ethos focuses on continuous delivery of value, clear definition of desired outcomes, and responsiveness to customer and market feedback. Products act as vehicles through which organisations strategically invest, manage resources, and consistently deliver value. Ideally, every product should have clearly defined boundaries, recognised stakeholders, distinct users, and measurable value, aligning the entire organisation around real customer requirements.

    Projects can still have a place within a product-centric model. Consider cross-product initiatives, such as GDPR compliance, which impact multiple products. In this scenario, product leadership carefully balances these overarching needs with specific product goals, integrating compliance teams as key stakeholders who actively influence the Product Backlog to ensure alignment and value maximisation.

    ## Defining the Agile Product Operating Model

    An operating model itself isn't new—it provides a holistic framework describing how a company delivers on its strategy. APOM specifically adapts this concept for products, embedding agility into the organisational fabric. Each product operates under its tailored Agile Product Operating Model, capable of evolving in response to insights and market dynamics.

    The Agile Product Operating Model integrates Professional Scrum, product thinking, and contemporary product management practices to enable organisations to swiftly adapt, evolve, and deliver valuable, customer-focused products. Each product within this model incorporates:

    - **Business Roadmap**: Clearly connecting the product to broader business strategy.
    - **Technology Roadmap**: Defining how technology will evolve to support strategic goals.
    - **Operational Stability**: Transparent service levels for clarity.
    - **Governance and Flow**: Management and control of changes.
    - **Total Cost of Value**: Understanding the economics of value and cost.

    ### Core Components of APOM

    The Agile Product Operating Model consists of interconnected elements reinforcing one another:

    - **People and Organisation**: Clear roles, responsibilities, and organisational structure.
    - **Measures and Incentives**: Data-driven performance indicators and communication of success.
    - **Agile Processes**: Methods for collaboration, communication, and iterative delivery.
    - **Governance**: Clear decision-making frameworks, oversight, and control mechanisms.
    - **Culture and Behaviour**: Core values, beliefs, attitudes, and rules influencing actions.

    The Agile Product Operating Model is not a prescriptive or one-size-fits-all approach; instead, it offers flexible guidance enabling organisations to craft their own product-centric operating model. Organisations don't 'implement' APOM—they actively shape and continuously adapt their version of it, reflecting their unique circumstances and evolving requirements.

    ## Evidence-Based Decision Making

    Transparency and visibility underpin effective decision-making. By making critical information readily accessible, organisations empower teams and leaders to make informed decisions, break down silos, and foster a culture of open communication and continuous learning.

    [Evidence-Based Management (EBM)]({{< ref "/tags/evidence-based-management" >}}) is fundamental to the Agile Product Operating Model, ensuring decisions are grounded in measurable outcomes and purposeful experimentation. By openly sharing these outcomes, teams can effectively manage, measure, and optimise product value. EBM promotes continuous improvement, precise measurement of value, proactive risk management, and strategic investment decisions, prioritising empirical evidence over intuition or bias.

    The Agile Product Operating Model isn't merely about agility for its own sake; it leverages existing agile investments, aligning teams and stakeholders around products as primary drivers of sustainable, measurable value.

    **Agency** is **the capacity, condition, or state of acting or exerting power**. In Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and organisational change, it means **the ability to act with autonomy, intentionality, and accountability toward meaningful goals within socio-technical environments**.

    - **Agency is essential for self-management**, the foundation of Scrum as a **social technology**.
    - **Agency enables Developers to deliver value**, Scrum Masters to **coach organisational evolution**, and Product Owners to **maximise product outcomes**.
    - Without agency, **accountability is a lie**. You cannot be accountable for what you have no authority to influence.

    If you do not cultivate agency, you are not doing Scrum, Agile, or DevOps. You are simply performing rituals, undermining any hope of empirical improvement.

    **Agentic Agility** is the expression of agency—human or AI—within socio-technical environments. It is the ability to take **intentional, adaptive action** to improve outcomes and align with evolving goals.  
    It transforms passive responsiveness into purposeful intervention.

    Without agency, Agile collapses into hollow ceremony. With it, both people and systems can deliberately shape value delivery.

    ### Human Agentic Agility

    Emerges through intent, accountability, and reflection. It demands practitioners challenge assumptions, adapt priorities, and reshape mental models through double-loop learning.

    ### AI Agentic Agility

    Operates through constrained autonomy. AI optimises actions based on data signals, adjusts within predefined parameters, and escalates or recommends based on predictive models.

    Humans act with **discernment**. AI acts within **constraints**.

    ## Why Agentic Agility Matters

    - **Humans** without agency become compliant executors.
    - **AI** without designed agency becomes uncontrolled or inert.
    - **Socio-technical environments** without embedded agency default to bureaucracy or chaos.

    Agentic Agility is **the missing lever** for adaptive organisations.  
    It empowers practitioners to evolve **not just what they deliver**, but **how they work**, ensuring agility remains a living, resilient capability—not a hollow label.

    title: Acceptance Test Driven Development
    abstract: Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a collaborative methodology that prioritises the establishment of clear, testable acceptance criteria prior to feature implementation. Originating from the need for alignment among stakeholders—such as product owners, developers, and testers—ATDD ensures a shared understanding of success metrics for features, thereby minimising miscommunication and the potential for rework. This approach enhances the predictability and sustainability of value delivery by integrating quality assurance early in the development process, promoting a shift-left mindset that allows teams to identify and resolve issues proactively. The emphasis on early testing not only improves software quality but also nurtures a culture of collaboration and shared accountability within teams. Furthermore, the long-term advantages of ATDD extend beyond immediate project results; it fosters a systematic working method that encourages continuous improvement and adaptability to evolving requirements. By consistently implementing ATDD, organisations can enhance their agility and efficiency in delivering higher value to customers, making it a fundamental practice that reinforces the overall development process and keeps teams focused on what is essential for the business and its users.

    Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a collaborative approach that emphasises defining clear, testable acceptance criteria before the implementation of features. This practice ensures that all stakeholders, including product owners, developers, and testers, share a common understanding of what constitutes success for a given feature. By establishing these criteria upfront, teams can align their development efforts with business needs, reducing the risk of miscommunication and rework.

    ATDD enhances the predictability and sustainability of value delivery by embedding quality into the development process from the outset. It encourages a shift-left mindset, where testing is integrated early, allowing teams to identify and address issues before they escalate. This proactive approach not only improves the quality of the software but also fosters a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility among team members.

    The long-term benefits of ATDD extend beyond immediate project outcomes; it cultivates a systematic way of working that supports continuous improvement and learning. By consistently applying ATDD, organisations can enhance their agility, adapt to changing requirements, and ultimately deliver higher value to customers more efficiently. This practice is not merely a technique but a foundational element that strengthens the overall development process, ensuring that teams remain focused on delivering what truly matters to the business and its users.
