Install and Configuration refers to the essential processes involved in setting up and optimising tools, software, and platforms that support agile, lean, and DevOps practices. This concept is crucial as it lays the groundwork for teams to operate efficiently and effectively, ensuring that the right systems are in place to facilitate collaboration, communication, and continuous delivery of value. 

By focusing on proper installation and configuration, organisations can minimise disruptions and technical debt, allowing teams to concentrate on delivering high-quality products. This proactive approach enables predictable and sustainable value delivery, as teams can rely on well-configured environments that support their workflows and methodologies. 

Moreover, effective installation and configuration practices contribute to long-term systemic improvements, fostering an environment where teams can adapt to changing requirements and innovate continuously. This concept is not merely about technical setup; it embodies a strategic mindset that prioritises the alignment of tools with organisational goals, ultimately enhancing overall performance and agility. The ability to swiftly configure systems in response to feedback and evolving needs is a hallmark of high-performing teams, driving both efficiency and effectiveness in product development.
