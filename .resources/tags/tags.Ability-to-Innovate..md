The Ability to Innovate (A2I) is a critical organisational capability that measures and enhances an organisation's capacity to generate new value through innovative practices. It focuses on leveraging empirical data to inform decision-making, ensuring that innovation is not just a sporadic event but a sustainable, systemic process. A2I empowers teams to adapt quickly to changing market demands and customer needs, fostering an environment where experimentation and learning are integral to the workflow.

This concept is distinct from Agile frameworks or Lean principles, which primarily address processes and methodologies. A2I emphasises the long-term cultivation of a culture that prioritises innovation as a core value, enabling teams to deliver value predictably and sustainably. By integrating Evidence-Based Management (EBM) into the innovation process, organisations can systematically assess their innovation efforts, identify areas for improvement, and make informed adjustments to their strategies.

The focus on A2I encourages a mindset shift from merely executing tasks to actively seeking opportunities for improvement and differentiation. This proactive approach not only enhances team motivation and engagement but also positions the organisation to thrive in a competitive landscape, where the ability to innovate becomes a key differentiator in achieving strategic goals and maintaining relevance in the market.
