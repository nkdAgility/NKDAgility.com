title: Working Software
abstract: Working Software is a fundamental artifact in Agile, Scrum, and Lean frameworks, serving as the tangible output of a team's efforts throughout the development process. It emerges from iterative development cycles and acts as a demonstration of progress and value delivery. In Scrum, working software is the primary success metric for each Sprint, encapsulated in the Increment artifact, which is subject to inspection and adaptation based on stakeholder feedback. The Definition of Done ensures that the software meets established quality criteria, making it valuable and ready for release. The importance of working software lies in its ability to provide a concrete measure of progress, aligning teams and stakeholders around completed work and remaining tasks. It transcends mere code, representing deliverables that address real-world needs and customer expectations, thereby maintaining a focus on value delivery. In agile methodologies, the emphasis on working software fosters continuous feedback and improvement, enabling teams to release increments iteratively and adapt to evolving requirements. This focus enhances collaboration, increases transparency, and drives ongoing improvement within organisations. Ultimately, working software is not solely about technical execution; it is about consistently delivering value, responding to customer needs, and ensuring long-term sustainability, thereby contributing to customer satisfaction, innovation, and overall business success.

  **Use this category only for discussions on Working Software.**  
  Working Software refers to the tangible, usable output produced as part of an Agile, Lean, or DevOps process. It is a core artifact in frameworks like Scrum, where each increment represents working, high-quality software that aligns with customer needs and business goals.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition of working software as an artifact in Scrum and Agile frameworks.
  - The role of working software in measuring progress and value delivery.
  - Techniques for ensuring quality and functionality in delivered software.
  - The importance of iterative delivery and continuous feedback in maintaining working software.
  - Aligning working software with user needs and business objectives.
  - Best practices for ensuring the software remains maintainable and adaptable over time.
  - The relationship between working software and customer satisfaction.

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - Discussions about tools or practices that do not directly involve the creation of working software.
  - Content that focuses on theoretical concepts without connecting them to deliverable software.
  - Content that presents working software as a **principle**, rather than an output artifact.

**Working Software** is a core **artifact** in Agile, Scrum, and Lean frameworks, representing the **tangible output** of a team’s work. It is the product of iterative development, and it **demonstrates progress** and **value delivery**. Unlike methods or practices, which define **how** work is done, **working software** is the **concrete result**—the **increment** produced at the end of each Sprint or iteration.

In **Scrum**, **working software** is the primary measure of success for each Sprint, and it forms the **Increment** artifact. It is **inspectable**, **adaptable**, and directly informs decisions, allowing teams to adjust their efforts based on the feedback received. The **Definition of Done** ensures that the software meets predefined criteria of quality, ensuring that the Increment is **valuable**, **functional**, and ready for release.

The significance of working software lies in its ability to provide a **real, tangible measure** of progress. It aligns **teams** and **stakeholders** around what has been completed and what remains. Working software is not just **code**; it is a **deliverable** that addresses **real-world needs** and **customer expectations**, ensuring teams are always focused on delivering value.

In agile methodologies, working software is the product of continuous feedback and improvement. Teams release increments iteratively, ensuring they are always improving the software and adapting to changing requirements. By focusing on working software, organisations **enhance collaboration**, **increase transparency**, and **drive continuous improvement**. It also encourages **adaptive planning**, as teams continuously refine their work to meet new challenges and customer feedback.

Working software isn’t just about technical proficiency. It’s about **delivering value consistently**, **responding to customer needs**, and **ensuring sustainability** over time. By focusing on high-quality working software, teams ensure they are not just building features, but creating functional products that drive **customer satisfaction**, **innovation**, and **business success**.
