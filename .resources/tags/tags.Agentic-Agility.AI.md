title: Agentic Agility
abstract: 'Agentic Agility refers to the ability of both humans and artificial intelligence to take intentional and adaptive actions within a work environment to enhance outcomes and align with changing objectives. This concept emerges from the need for proactive engagement rather than mere reactive behaviour in agile and DevOps practices. It is crucial in product development and organisational design as it fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement, allowing teams to challenge existing assumptions and adapt their strategies effectively. There are two primary forms of Agentic Agility: Human Agentic Agility, which relies on intent, accountability, and reflective practices such as double-loop learning, and AI Agentic Agility, which functions through autonomous systems that respond to data signals and optimise actions within set parameters. The distinction lies in the decision-making processes, where humans utilise judgement and social contracts, while AI operates based on predefined logic and feedback mechanisms. By integrating Agentic Agility into workflows, organisations can ensure that both individuals and systems are empowered to create value continuously, moving beyond mere adherence to agile methodologies and fostering a more dynamic and responsive work culture.'

  **Use this category only for discussions on Agentic Agility.**  
  Agentic Agility refers to the ability to intentionally shape outcomes through autonomy, adaptability, and alignment with value, applicable to both human practitioners and AI systems within socio-technical environments. This category focuses on the transformative capacity of individuals and systems to engage purposefully in their work, moving beyond mere responsiveness to proactive intervention.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Agentic Agility
  - Distinction between Human Agentic Agility and AI Agentic Agility
  - The role of intent, accountability, and reflection in Human Agentic Agility
  - Mechanisms of AI Agentic Agility, including data-driven decision-making and predictive modelling
  - The impact of Agentic Agility on organisational agility and value creation
  - The importance of double-loop learning in fostering Human Agentic Agility
  - The interplay between human judgement and AI logic in achieving desired outcomes
  - Case studies or examples illustrating Agentic Agility in practice

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to the intentional shaping of outcomes
  - Misinterpretations of agency in Agile practices
  - Content that does not differentiate between human and AI capabilities in the context of agility
  - General Agile or DevOps practices that do not specifically address the concept of agency and intentionality

**Agentic Agility** is the capacity—human or AI—to take intentional, adaptive action within a system of work to improve outcomes and align with evolving goals. It transforms passive responsiveness into **purposeful intervention**.

There are **two distinct expressions** of Agentic Agility:

- **Human Agentic Agility** is grounded in **intent, accountability, and reflection**. It is expressed when practitioners challenge assumptions, adapt priorities, or reshape mental models through double-loop learning.
- **AI Agentic Agility** operates through **autonomous, constrained systems** that respond to data signals and optimise within defined boundaries. It manifests in tools that recommend actions, escalate issues, or adjust plans based on predictive models.

To disambiguate:

- Humans act with _judgement and social contract_; AI acts within _predefined logic and monitored feedback loops_.
- Humans learn by transforming beliefs; AI learns by refining models.

Agentic Agility enables agility with intent. Without agency, Agile becomes ceremony. With it, both people and systems can continuously shape value.
