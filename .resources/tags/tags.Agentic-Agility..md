description: Agentic Agility is the ability to deliberately shape outcomes through autonomy, adaptability, and alignment with value. It applies to both human practitioners and AI systems operating within socio-technical environments.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Agentic Agility.**  
  Agentic Agility refers to the ability to intentionally shape outcomes through autonomy, adaptability, and alignment with value, applicable to both human practitioners and AI systems within socio-technical environments. This category focuses on the transformative capacity of individuals and systems to engage purposefully in their work, moving beyond mere responsiveness to proactive intervention.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Agentic Agility
  - Distinction between Human Agentic Agility and AI Agentic Agility
  - The role of intent, accountability, and reflection in Human Agentic Agility
  - Mechanisms of AI Agentic Agility, including data-driven decision-making and predictive modelling
  - The impact of Agentic Agility on organisational agility and value creation
  - The importance of double-loop learning in fostering Human Agentic Agility
  - The interplay between human judgement and AI logic in achieving desired outcomes
  - Case studies or examples illustrating Agentic Agility in practice

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to the intentional shaping of outcomes
  - Misinterpretations of agency in Agile practices
  - Content that does not differentiate between human and AI capabilities in the context of agility
  - General Agile or DevOps practices that do not specifically address the concept of agency and intentionality

**Agentic Agility** is the capacity—human or AI—to take intentional, adaptive action within a system of work to improve outcomes and align with evolving goals. It transforms passive responsiveness into **purposeful intervention**.

There are **two distinct expressions** of Agentic Agility:

- **Human Agentic Agility** is grounded in **intent, accountability, and reflection**. It is expressed when practitioners challenge assumptions, adapt priorities, or reshape mental models through double-loop learning.
- **AI Agentic Agility** operates through **autonomous, constrained systems** that respond to data signals and optimise within defined boundaries. It manifests in tools that recommend actions, escalate issues, or adjust plans based on predictive models.

To disambiguate:

- Humans act with _judgement and social contract_; AI acts within _predefined logic and monitored feedback loops_.
- Humans learn by transforming beliefs; AI learns by refining models.

Agentic Agility enables agility with intent. Without agency, Agile becomes ceremony. With it, both people and systems can continuously shape value.
