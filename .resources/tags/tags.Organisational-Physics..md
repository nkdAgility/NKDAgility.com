title: Organisational Physics
abstract: Organisational Physics is a conceptual model that applies systems thinking to understand and influence the dynamics within an organisation. It originates from the need to comprehend how various elements, including people, processes, and technology, interact and affect overall organisational behaviour and performance. This model is crucial in agile, DevOps, and product development contexts as it enables teams to recognise patterns and feedback loops, thereby identifying systemic issues and areas for improvement. By providing a framework for understanding the forces at play, Organisational Physics facilitates more effective decision-making, change management, and innovation. It empowers organisations to become more adaptable and resilient, allowing them to respond to challenges while maintaining a focus on value delivery. Rather than merely managing specific methodologies, this approach offers a holistic perspective on the underlying dynamics that drive performance, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. In an era of rapid change, Organisational Physics serves as a foundation for leaders to align their strategies with the realities of their operational environments, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes and contributing to long-term organisational success.
