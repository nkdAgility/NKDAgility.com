With the shift-left movement pushing more responsibility to the engineering teams what practices will help them cope with running a production site. These are the experience of the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) Services team and their journey from on premises to a fully fledged SAAS solution and way they need to do to run it and build trust with their customers.

We will cover the importance of [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}), telemetry, on-call, and how to protect your feature teams from disruptions without them loosing touch with production.
