    ### **Post 3: The Theatre of [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Without Agency**

    If you remove a [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})’s ability to decide how they work, but still expect them to act "self-managing," you have not enabled Scrum.  
    You have built a hollow stage set — a theatre where the ceremonies of Scrum continue but none of the outcomes emerge.

    The daily standup becomes a status meeting.  
    The [Sprint Review]({{< ref "/tags/sprint-review" >}}) becomes a demo.  
    The Retrospective becomes a list of suggestions no one implements.

    Scrum collapses into theatre because the real enabler of agility — **agency** — has been denied.

    [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) reminds us to **observe how work flows through a system**.  
    Scrum, as a **social technology**, reminds us that human systems flow around ownership and accountability.

    No agency, no adaptation.  
    No adaptation, no agility.

    If you want the benefits of Scrum, you must first give your teams the autonomy to own how they deliver.

    Scrum cannot be half-built.  
    You either trust your teams to manage themselves within alignment, or you are playing at Scrum.

    What part of your system still operates on command-and-control while pretending to enable agility?

    ### **Post 2: No Control, No Accountability**

    Those who are accountable for results must have control over that which influences their delivery.

    It is astonishing how often organisations expect [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Masters, Product Owners, or Developers to deliver outcomes but strip them of the ability to act:

    - Teams are blocked by dependency bottlenecks no one has authority to resolve.
    - Product Owners must negotiate priorities with fifteen stakeholders they cannot say no to.
    - Scrum Masters are expected to coach change but are forbidden from challenging dysfunctional policies.

    You cannot demand accountability and deny agency.  
    You cannot expect ownership while treating people like task executors.

    **Scrum Teams must be empowered to remove impediments, challenge dysfunction, and realign stakeholders where necessary.**

    Anything less is a setup for failure.

    Real Scrum is not about compliance to a process.  
    It is about enabling adaptive [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}) through self-managing teams operating inside clear strategic boundaries.

    No agency, no Scrum.

    Where are you seeing accountability without authority in your organisation?  
    What would change if you actually trusted your teams?

    ### **Post 1: The Dangerous Myth of Alignment Without Autonomy**

    In most organisations trying to "do agile," the idea of alignment is treated like a religion. Vision statements. OKRs. Strategy walls. Executive town halls.

    Everyone talks about alignment. Few dare talk about the other half of the equation: **autonomy**.

    Alignment without autonomy is just control.  
    It is cosmetic commitment without the capacity to act.

    [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) as a **social technology** depends on self-management, and self-management demands real agency. Teams must be able to decide _how_ they achieve goals — not just be handed goals with a checklist of rules.

    If you tell a [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) what they must achieve, but you also tell them exactly how to do it, who to ask permission from, and when to deliver each piece, you have not created alignment. You have created obedience.

    Alignment without autonomy kills ownership.  
    It kills innovation.  
    It kills agility.

    If you are serious about agility, you must give teams both a clear goal **and** the freedom to own how they get there.

    Otherwise, stop pretending it is Scrum. Call it what it is: Command and Control, Version 2.0.

    **Where is your organisation pretending alignment is enough?**
