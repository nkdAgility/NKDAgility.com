### **Post 2: No Control, No Accountability**

Those who are accountable for results must have control over that which influences their delivery.

It is astonishing how often organisations expect [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Masters, Product Owners, or Developers to deliver outcomes but strip them of the ability to act:

- Teams are blocked by dependency bottlenecks no one has authority to resolve.
- Product Owners must negotiate priorities with fifteen stakeholders they cannot say no to.
- Scrum Masters are expected to coach change but are forbidden from challenging dysfunctional policies.

You cannot demand accountability and deny agency.  
You cannot expect ownership while treating people like task executors.

**Scrum Teams must be empowered to remove impediments, challenge dysfunction, and realign stakeholders where necessary.**

Anything less is a setup for failure.

Real Scrum is not about compliance to a process.  
It is about enabling adaptive [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}) through self-managing teams operating inside clear strategic boundaries.

No agency, no Scrum.

Where are you seeing accountability without authority in your organisation?  
What would change if you actually trusted your teams?
