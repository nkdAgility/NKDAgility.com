### **Post 1: The Dangerous Myth of Alignment Without Autonomy**

In most organisations trying to "do agile," the idea of alignment is treated like a religion. Vision statements. OKRs. Strategy walls. Executive town halls.

Everyone talks about alignment. Few dare talk about the other half of the equation: **autonomy**.

Alignment without autonomy is just control.  
It is cosmetic commitment without the capacity to act.

[Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) as a **social technology** depends on self-management, and self-management demands real agency. Teams must be able to decide _how_ they achieve goals â€” not just be handed goals with a checklist of rules.

If you tell a [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) what they must achieve, but you also tell them exactly how to do it, who to ask permission from, and when to deliver each piece, you have not created alignment. You have created obedience.

Alignment without autonomy kills ownership.  
It kills innovation.  
It kills agility.

If you are serious about agility, you must give teams both a clear goal **and** the freedom to own how they get there.

Otherwise, stop pretending it is Scrum. Call it what it is: Command and Control, Version 2.0.

**Where is your organisation pretending alignment is enough?**
