### **Post 3: The Theatre of [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Without Agency**

If you remove a [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})’s ability to decide how they work, but still expect them to act "self-managing," you have not enabled Scrum.  
You have built a hollow stage set — a theatre where the ceremonies of Scrum continue but none of the outcomes emerge.

The daily standup becomes a status meeting.  
The [Sprint Review]({{< ref "/tags/sprint-review" >}}) becomes a demo.  
The Retrospective becomes a list of suggestions no one implements.

Scrum collapses into theatre because the real enabler of agility — **agency** — has been denied.

[Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) reminds us to **observe how work flows through a system**.  
Scrum, as a **social technology**, reminds us that human systems flow around ownership and accountability.

No agency, no adaptation.  
No adaptation, no agility.

If you want the benefits of Scrum, you must first give your teams the autonomy to own how they deliver.

Scrum cannot be half-built.  
You either trust your teams to manage themselves within alignment, or you are playing at Scrum.

What part of your system still operates on command-and-control while pretending to enable agility?
