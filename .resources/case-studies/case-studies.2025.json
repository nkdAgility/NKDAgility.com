  "BodyContent": "**Client:** SLB (formerly Schlumberger)  \n**Engagement Lead:** Martin Hinshelwood, Chief Consultant at NKD Agility  \n**Service Focus:** Engineering Excellence & Technical Leadership Through Source Control and Build Strategy Consolidation\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nSLB, a global leader in the oil and gas technology sector, was operating 90 development teams across 13 locations in 9 countries—all contributing to a single product with a $50,000-per-license price tag. But beneath this global scale lay deep technical debt, fragmented toolchains, and an unsustainable build process.\n\nNKD Agility, led by Martin Hinshelwood, was brought in to diagnose the dysfunction and advise on a strategy to consolidate the organization’s tooling, build, and source control strategy. By enabling a transition to a unified engineering environment and giving teams ownership of their release pipelines, SLB achieved true engineering excellence.\n\n## 2. Client Challenge: Technical Chaos at Scale\n\n**Situation Before Engagement:**\n\n- 90 development teams.\n- 13 global locations, 9 countries.\n- Each team used different source control and build systems (Git, TFVC, SVN, even in-house tools).\n- Central build team handled 11,000 builds daily (1.2 million builds/year).\n- 27 petabytes of build data moved annually.\n- No consistent view of development pipelines or code branches.\n\n**Risks Identified:**\n\n- Systemic inefficiency and slow releases.\n- High engineering burnout.\n- Loss of competitive edge due to technical debt and fractured infrastructure.\n- Risk of losing a multi-billion dollar product.\n\n## 3. NKD Agility’s Diagnosis & Strategic Approach\n\nMartin Hinshelwood conducted a comprehensive ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) assessment for SLB. The root issues identified were:\n\n- Tool sprawl with no centralized governance.\n- Lack of consistent branching strategy.\n- Centralized build team creating a bottleneck.\n- Technical debt caused by acquisitions and uncoordinated practices.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations:**\n\n- Consolidate all teams into a single source control system.\n- Standardize branching and build strategies.\n- Empower development teams to take ownership of their build and deployment pipelines.\n\n## 4. The Transformation Journey\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n- Delivered a detailed target state architecture and governance model for source control and build.\n- Defined standard branching policies.\n- Enabled a phased migration to TFVC (later Git), standardizing tools across all teams.\n- Advised on decentralizing build responsibilities to product teams.\n\n**Role of NKD Agility:**\n\n- Provided strategic advice and architectural blueprints.\n- Coached internal leaders and engineers through change.\n- Validated progress and advised on course correction.\n\n## 5. Measurable Outcomes & Impact\n\n**Quantifiable Wins:**\n\n- Source control consolidation achieved.\n- 90+ teams adopted a unified branching strategy.\n- 90 teams transitioned to owning their own build and release pipelines.\n- Central build team reduced from 8 to 2.\n- Significant improvements in deployment throughput and developer autonomy.\n\n**Cultural and Operational Gains:**\n\n- Engineering morale improved.\n- Reduced dependency bottlenecks.\n- Faster releases with fewer errors.\n- Engineering excellence embedded at team level.\n\n## 6. Why It Matters: A Model for Engineering Transformation\n\nSLB’s success story exemplifies how large enterprises can drive transformation at scale when technical leadership is aligned with operational reality. NKD Agility’s strength lies not in doing the work, but in enabling organizations to do it well themselves.\n\n**Martin Hinshelwood’s Strategic Insight:**\n\n> “Engineering excellence and technical leadership mean putting responsibility in the hands of the people doing the work. If they break it, they fix it. That’s where resilience, speed, and learning come from.”\n\n## 7. Final Takeaway\n\nWith NKD Agility’s guidance, SLB turned chaos into clarity. This case demonstrates the power of expert diagnosis, realistic strategy, and leadership that enables autonomy. It is a blueprint for CTOs seeking to scale without losing their edge.\n\n[Contact Us] to schedule a free strategy call.\n",
