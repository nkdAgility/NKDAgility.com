This guide supports teams and leaders in shaping shared direction, measuring progress meaningfully, and using OKRs not as a formality, but as a living system for navigating complexity and improving performance.\n\n## Definition of OKRs\n\n**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** are a lightweight discipline for defining and testing what matters most. Objectives express strategic intent. Key Results make that intent observable and falsifiable. Together, they enable individuals and teams to align around purpose, focus their efforts, and evaluate whether their work leads to meaningful outcomes.&#x20;\n\nOKRs consist of:\n\n- **Objectives**: Qualitative, inspiring, directional goals that articulate where we want to go.\n- **Key Results**: Quantitative, time-bound measures that define how we know we are making progress.\n\nThey are not project plans. They are a lightweight mechanism for aligning strategic intention with measurable progress.\n\n## Principles Behind OKRs\n\nThe OKR framework rests on four irreducible first principles shaped by Peter Drucker, Andy Grove, and John Doerr: **Clarity of Purpose**, **Alignment**, **Measurement**, and **Accountability**.\n\n- **Clarity of Purpose** - OKRs distil focus. Drucker advocated for shared and public objectives to unify effort. Grove operationalised this by insisting on fewer, well-scoped goals with clear metrics. Doerr reinforced the idea that inspiration must be grounded in execution; objectives must be motivational but paired with measurable key results.\n- **Alignment** - OKRs promote shared direction. Drucker’s early MBO stressed aligning individual contributions with enterprise-wide goals. Grove extended this with cascading OKRs and bottom-up participation. Doerr championed organisational transparency, making every OKR visible to foster unity across teams.\n- **Measurement** - OKRs insist on observable outcomes. Drucker warned against managing by intuition. Grove introduced Key Results as measurable indicators of progress. Doerr summarised this as \"measure what matters\"—metrics aren’t optional, they define what success looks like.\n- **Accountability**  - OKRs build a system of ownership and follow-through. Drucker envisioned self-management through mutually agreed-upon goals. Grove made OKRs a recurring practice of review and adjustment, decoupled from compensation. Doerr extended this with tools for tracking and public scoring, reinforcing commitment through visibility.\n\nThese principles enable OKRs to become a management tool for aligning purposeful effort with measurable performance. They shift the organisation away from static reporting and toward active contribution, feedback, and course correction, making objectives a means for directing energy and learning, not documenting activity.\n\n## OKRs and Strategic Planning\n\n**OKRs do not replace strategic plans or roadmaps—they connect intent to action.** They express strategic priorities as working hypotheses, helping teams focus their energy on what matters now and test whether it produces the outcomes the organisation needs.\n\nIn practice, OKRs give form to strategy by:\n\n- Expressing enterprise priorities as shared, quarterly Objectives.\n- Using KPIs as reference points, not destinations.\n- Distilling roadmaps into outcomes rather than outputs.\n\nIn mature organisations, OKRs become a disciplined way to manage by contribution. They help teams navigate ambiguity, inspect performance, and adjust course without losing sight of the goal..\n\n## Structural Enablers for Managing by Objectives\n\nFor OKRs to function as a management tool rather than a procedural formality, the organisation must first establish the conditions that allow teams to contribute meaningfully to enterprise performance. These are not merely technical prerequisites, but structural commitments to clarity, responsibility, and decentralised control. Each condition below supports the ability of individuals and teams to manage by objectives and act on shared purpose.\n\n1. **Clear Organisational Vision and Goals** – A shared vision is the starting point for managing by objectives. Teams cannot align around outcomes without knowing what matters most. Strategic clarity enables teams to focus their contributions on what drives enterprise performance.\n2. **Strong Leadership Support and Sponsorship** – Leadership must do more than approve OKRs; they must model their use. When leaders set and reflect on OKRs themselves, they legitimise the system as a tool for direction, performance, and learning.\n3. **Hypothesis-Driven Thinking** – Objectives should not be treated as certainties. They are assumptions about what actions will create meaningful outcomes. OKRs function best when each one is seen as a strategic hypothesis to be tested and refined based on evidence.\n4. **Lean Thinking and Flow Awareness** – OKRs depend on a system that delivers value without waste or overburden. OKRs help surface where strategic assumptions about value delivery break down, by making it clear when intended outcomes fail to materialise. This enables ongoing inspection of system performance and supports adaptation where needed.\n5. **Agile and Adaptable Work Culture** – To manage by objectives, teams must be trusted to self-correct. OKRs require short feedback loops, freedom to pivot, and decentralised ownership of outcomes. Rigidity undermines initiative; adaptability sustains it.\n\n&#x20;\n\nThese conditions are not optional. They form the structural foundation that determines whether OKRs serve as a tool for purposeful contribution and feedback, or collapse into ritualised compliance. Without them, OKRs lose their capacity to guide informed action and measurable performance.\n\n## Areas of Responsibility and Contribution\n\nEvery function that supports OKRs must be understood not merely by title or process responsibility, but by the contribution it makes to organisational performance. The roles defined here are not hierarchical positions or checklists, but expressions of functional responsibility. Each exists to help the organisation translate strategy into meaningful outcomes, guided by shared direction, measurable progress, and continuous learning. These are not job titles but areas of responsibility that shape how OKRs are defined, tracked, and adapted over time.\n\n### OKR Coach\n\nThe OKR Coach supports the adoption and evolution of OKRs across the organisation. They mentor OKR Leads and Champions, ensure consistency in implementation, and promote discipline in writing and evaluating OKRs. While not involved in the day-to-day management of OKRs, the coach stewards coherence and learning across teams. They help surface and navigate constraints, challenge unexamined assumptions, and encourage the organisation to treat OKRs as an evolving social system, not a fixed method to be applied uniformly. Their role is to provoke reflective practice, not enforce standardisation.\n\n**What OKR Coaches enable:**\n\n- Mentoring OKR Leads and Champions in sense-making and adaptive OKR use\n- Helping teams improve their ability to define meaningful, measurable, and strategically aligned OKRs\n- Enabling teams to reflect across cycles to improve outcome focus and adaptive capacity\n- Provoking thoughtful challenge to rigid patterns that inhibit learning or ownership\n- Cultivating feedback loops that promote organisational learning\n- Making invisible blockers and organisational constraints visible\n\n### OKR Lead\n\nThe OKR Lead drives implementation of OKRs as a shared tool for strategic clarity and adaptive alignment. Their role is to support the use of OKRs as a lightweight, evidence-oriented way of expressing intent, uncovering systemic barriers, and enabling outcome-oriented decision-making. They maintain the rhythm and discipline of the OKR cycle, help teams interpret learning across domains, and support leadership in connecting strategic planning to actionable, measurable outcomes.\n\n**What OKR Leads make happen:**\n\n- Supporting cross-team and executive alignment of strategic themes\n- Maintaining predictable rhythm to support clarity, accountability, and feedback\n- Enabling OKR Champions through training, guidance, tools, and coaching\n- Ensuring visibility into whether OKRs align with strategy and expose system-level gaps\n- Identifying systemic misalignments and constraints using OKRs as signals\n- Turning OKR results into strategy-shaping insight through deliberate feedback mechanisms\n\n### OKR Champion\n\nThe OKR Champion owns the OKR process at the team or department level. They facilitate workshops, check-ins, reviews, and retrospectives. Champions promote transparency, enable teams to be engaged in their OKRs, and escalate blockers. They serve as operational anchors for the OKR cadence, ensuring the process remains lightweight, disciplined, and adaptable. They coach the team on applying OKR principles without adding ceremony.\n\n**How OKR Champions create impact:**\n\n- Enabling consistent inspection of progress, learning, and alignment through regular cadence\n- Supporting teams in writing and refining OKRs\n- Helping the team continuously use OKRs to guide decisions and focus\n- Escalating unresolved impediments or misalignments\n- Supporting the team in interpreting OKRs as shared direction, not assigned targets\n\n### Team Leader\n\nTeam Leaders provide the strategic direction for their teams. They ensure that team OKRs reflect organisational goals and that OKRs become part of day-to-day conversations. Leaders coach team members, remove impediments, and model accountability by sharing and tracking their own OKRs. They reinforce focus and discipline in execution.\n\n**Team Leaders are responsible for:**\n\n- Ensuring team-level OKRs align with organisational intent\n- Making OKRs the basis for team planning, prioritisation, and evidence-based adjustments\n- Coaching team members in goal definition and alignment\n- Removing blockers that inhibit OKR delivery\n- Demonstrating use of OKRs as a personal and team accountability tool\n\n### Team Member\n\nTeam Members contribute actively to defining and delivering OKRs. They participate in workshops, provide updates during check-ins, and assist in evaluating outcomes during reviews. Each team member owns their role in achieving shared goals and contributes insights during retrospectives to improve the system.\n\n**Team Members contribute by:**\n\n- Contributing to the creation of meaningful and measurable OKRs\n- Proactively communicating OKR progress to support shared visibility and adaptation\n- Taking initiative to surface issues that affect team outcomes\n- Using reviews to understand impact and improve personal and team contribution\n- Taking ownership of individual and shared OKR outcomes\n\n## Events in the OKR Cycle\n\nThe OKR cycle typically follows a quarterly cadence, although other cadences may be more optimal in some circumstances, and is built around four recurring events. Each event serves a distinct purpose in enabling alignment, focus, adaptation, and improvement throughout the cycle.\n\n| Event         | Timing          | Purpose                             | Facilitated By         |\n| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Definition    | Start of cycle  | Set direction and shared commitment | OKR Lead + Champion    |\n| Check-ins     | Weekly/Biweekly | Monitor progress, adapt execution   | OKR Champion           |\n| Review        | End of cycle    | Evaluate achievement and learn      | Team Leader + Champion |\n| Retrospective | End of cycle    | Inspect and improve the OKR system  | OKR Champion + Team    |\n\n### **Definition**\n\nThe Definition event begins the OKR cycle. It is the moment when strategic hypotheses are made explicit. Teams translate high-level intent into directional Objectives and testable Key Results. This isn’t just about agreement; it’s about surfacing assumptions and committing to learn through execution. OKRs crafted in this session shape how the team will focus, collaborate, and adapt over the coming cycle.\n\nThis event frames strategic assumptions as testable commitments, enabling teams to manage by contribution.\n\nThe Definition event should follow a structured format similar to:\n\n1. **Contextualise** – Set the strategic context.\n2. **Reflect** – Assess the current state.\n3. **Envision** – Explore aspirational futures.\n4. **Focus** – Select 1–3 objectives.\n5. **Quantify** – Define Key Results using the standard format.\n6. **Commit** – Agree as a team and publish transparently.\n\nA successful Definition event produces a coherent set of OKRs with clarity of purpose, strategic alignment, and strong ownership across the team. An example workshop is available in the appendix.\n\n### **Check-ins**\n\nCheck-ins are not status updates—they are leadership in action. These weekly or biweekly forums create the rhythm that turns objectives into feedback loops. Teams don’t just report—they inspect, sense, and respond. A well-run check-in makes misalignment visible early, enables decisions while there’s still time to act, and reinforces accountability through dialogue, not oversight.\n\nThis event helps teams gauge whether their efforts are yielding tangible results and provides a space to redirect energy when needed.\n\nOKRs are a living system. Use frequent check-ins to:\n\n- Inspect progress.\n- Celebrate learning.\n- Adapt expectations based on evidence.\n- Re-align if strategic intent shifts.&#x20;\n\n### **Review**\n\nThe Review is where strategy meets evidence. Held at the end of each cycle, it evaluates outcomes against the objectives and key results the team committed to. This isn’t about assigning blame or celebrating effort; it’s about examining what the work delivered, what it didn’t, and what the team now knows. - It measures contribution by inspecting what value was actually delivered.\n\n- It provides a disciplined moment to inspect execution against intent.\n- It informs planning by converting evidence into insight.\n- It treats surprises not as failure, but as signals for adaptation.\n\nThe OKR Champion and Team Leader co-facilitate this session. The team scores each key result and discusses the implications for planning and strategy. The goal is to learn what worked, what didn’t, and why, and to use that insight to evolve both the goals and the system itself.\n\nThis event turns evidence into clarity and insight, closing the loop on intent and informing the next iteration.\n\n**OKR Scoring and Reflection**\n\nScoring Key Results at the end of each cycle is essential for generating insight and driving learning. Common scoring systems include:\n\n- **0.0 to 1.0 scale** – Google’s standard: 1.0 = fully achieved; 0.7 = strong progress; below 0.4 = off-track.\n- **Traffic light** – Green (on track), Yellow (at risk), Red (off-track).\n- **Binary** – Done / Not Done (suitable for binary results only).\n\nEach team should select a consistent scoring model, apply it objectively, and use it as input for retrospective learning, rather than performance management. Teams should also document lessons learned during scoring to inform future cycles.\n\n### **Retrospective**\n\nThe Retrospective is the discipline of reflection turned inward. Where the Review examines outcomes, the Retrospective inspects the system that produced them. It asks: Did our OKRs help us contribute meaningfully? Was our cadence sustainable? Did we respond to feedback quickly enough? This is not an afterthought; it is a critical practice to ensure the OKR system remains effective, relevant, and adaptive.\n\nThis event protects the OKR practice from becoming stale, mechanical, or disconnected from purpose. It creates space to examine how the team engaged with the framework and where it could improve.\n\nThe OKR Champion facilitates a safe and constructive environment. The Team Leader supports actions to evolve how the team uses OKRs.\n\nRetrospectives strengthen the OKR system by improving clarity, engagement, and outcome orientation over time.\n\n---\n\n## Writing Effective OKRs\n\nOKRs are hypothesis-driven. Each Objective is a strategic bet, and each Key Result is a measurable test of whether that bet is paying off. Writing strong OKRs means making those bets explicit, verifiable, and time-bound.\n\nWriting effective OKRs requires rigour, intent, and a shared understanding of purpose. Poorly formed OKRs undermine alignment and dilute impact. This section outlines how to write Objectives and Key Results that are both inspirational and measurable.\n\n### Objectives\n\nObjectives articulate direction. They are concise, qualitative, and designed to inspire commitment. A well-written objective provides clarity of purpose and drives focus.\n\n- They describe a desired state or strategic outcome, not a task or activity.\n- Each objective should align with higher-level organisational goals and reflect team accountability.\n- Objectives must be limited in number (typically no more than three per team) to maintain focus and coherence.\n- The language used should be action-oriented, grounded in relevance to the team, and specific to the quarter.\n\n### Key Results\n\nKey Results define evidence of success. They are objective, time-bound, and measurable.\n\n- Each key result should quantify progress toward the objective. If it cannot be measured, it should not be a key result.\n- The preferred structure is: `Verb + Metric from X to Y by [Date]`. This format makes both baseline and target explicit.\n- Key results must reflect outcomes, not outputs or activities. Delivery of a feature is not a result; the value it enables is.\n- Use 2–4 key results per objective. Fewer may lack clarity; more risks fragmentation and loss of meaning.\n\nWell-formed OKRs are simple, clear, and directional. They provide a shared contract for value delivery and a baseline for meaningful review. Rewriting, challenging, and refining OKRs is expected and encouraged. The goal is not to generate volume, but precision.\n\n## Sub-Optimal OKR Practices to Avoid\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls is essential for maintaining the integrity and impact of OKRs. Below are frequent sub-optimal practices that undermine alignment, weaken accountability, and reduce the effectiveness of OKRs:\n\n- **Task Lists Disguised as Key Results** – Key Results should reflect measurable outcomes, not a to-do list. Replace vague activities with quantifiable evidence of change.\n- **Too Many OKRs** – Attempting to cover everything undermines focus. Limit objectives to the vital few and resist the urge to track every possible metric.\n- **Top-Down Mandates** – Imposing OKRs without team involvement leads to resistance and low ownership. A collaborative definition builds clarity and commitment.\n- **Misalignment** – OKRs that don’t connect to broader strategy create confusion. Ensure vertical and horizontal alignment across the organisation.\n- **No Regular Check-ins** – OKRs set and forgotten are ineffective. Frequent inspection and adaptation are critical for learning and progress.\n- **Vague or Unmeasurable KRs** – Ambiguity erodes accountability. If a key result can’t be objectively scored, it needs rework.\n- **Tying OKRs to Compensation** – Linking OKRs to pay or performance ratings discourages ambition and honesty. Keep OKRs aspirational, not evaluative.\n- **Binary Thinking** – All-or-nothing key results miss nuance. Use scaled outcomes or multiple indicators where appropriate to better reflect reality.\n\n## Final Words\n\nOKRs are not a silver bullet. They are a structured commitment to contribute, inspect, and learn. When grounded in shared purpose and practised with rigour and reflection, OKRs become a system of continuous coordination, enabling clarity of intent, validation of outcomes, and adaptive change.\n\nStart with purpose. Stay with feedback. Learn your way forward.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Open Space Technology for OKR Collaboration\n\nOpen Space Technology (OST) is a facilitation approach that supports self-organisation, emergent priorities, and rapid group learning, making it well-suited for use alongside OKRs. Introduced by Harrison Owen and applied widely through OpenSpace Agility, OST enables cross-functional collaboration in complex and time-sensitive environments.\n\nOST is particularly powerful when the following conditions are present:\n\n- A topic of urgent strategic importance\n- A diverse group of stakeholders with differing views\n- High complexity, potential for conflict, or interdependence\n\n### Core Characteristics\n\nOpen Space requires very little upfront structure. Instead of imposing a pre-defined agenda, participants co-create their own. The result is high engagement and personal ownership over outcomes. The format typically includes:\n\n- A clear and compelling theme\n- A voluntary, committed group\n- A large, open space with movable chairs and breakout areas\n- A blank agenda wall and a flexible process structure\n\n### The Event Structure\n\nOpen Space events typically unfold across the following stages:\n\n- **Opening** – Participants gather in a circle. The facilitator introduces the theme and invites anyone to propose topics for discussion.\n- **Agenda Setting** – Individuals write their proposed sessions on paper, announce them to the group, and post them on the agenda wall.\n- **Marketplace** – Attendees choose which sessions to attend based on interest and relevance.\n- **Sessions** – Multiple parallel conversations happen, each self-managed by participants.\n- **Evening News** – Informal summaries of learning and outcomes are shared.\n- **Closing** – A reflection circle where participants share takeaways and proposed next steps.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nOpen Space runs on four principles and one law:\n\n1. **Whoever comes are the right person**\n2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have**\n3. **Whenever it starts is the right time**\n4. **When it’s over, it’s over**\n\n**The Law of Two Feet**: If you find yourself in a situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet to go somewhere else where you can.\n\n### Open Space + OKRs\n\nOST is an ideal companion to OKR Definition or Reset events, especially in organisations:\n\n- Beginning a major transformation\n- Dealing with fragmentation or poor engagement\n- Seeking to decentralise strategic ownership\n\nYou can use Open Space:\n\n- To generate themes and strategic topics for future OKRs\n- As a mid-cycle alignment and issue-surfacing mechanism\n- For large-scale retrospectives at the end of OKR cycles\n- To build a sense of shared ownership across boundaries\n\nBecause participants choose the conversations that matter to them, Open Space surfaces hidden tensions, identifies emerging opportunities, and reinforces the principle of outcome ownership. It’s not just a facilitation method; it’s a social technology that unlocks collective intelligence and aligns diverse teams without prescription.\n\nOST and OKRs work together to strengthen collaboration, autonomy, and focus, enabling your organisation to adapt in real time while staying strategically aligned.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix B: Sample OKR Definition Workshop\n\n### Liberating Structures-based OKR Definition Workshop Design\n\nThis workshop format integrates OKR best practices and Liberating Structures to support high engagement, clarity, and alignment throughout the OKR Definition event.\n\n### Workshop Structure: From Purpose to Commitment\n\n#### 1. **Start with ‘Why’**\n\n**Structure:** _Nine Whys_\n\n- **Goal:** Surface and align around the deeper organisational purpose behind OKRs.\n- **Practices:** Link to strategy, equal speaking time using paired conversations.\n- **Time:** 20–30 mins\n\n#### 2. **Reflect on the Present**\n\n**Structure:** _What, So What, Now What?_\n\n- **Goal:** Reflect on the current state and past outcomes.\n- **Practices:** Silent self-reflection, small group sense-making, full group synthesis.\n- **Time:** 30–40 mins\n\n#### 3. **Envision the Future**\n\n**Structures:** _Appreciative Interviews_ → _25/10 Crowdsourcing_\n\n- **Goal:** Imagine meaningful future outcomes through stories of success and bold ideation.\n- **Practices:** Invite divergence and universal participation.\n- **Time:** 45 mins\n\n#### 4. **Focus and Refine**\n\n**Structures:** _1-2-4-All_ → _Min Specs_\n\n- **Goal:** Distil vision into 1–3 clear, focused objectives.\n- **Practices:** Transition from idea generation to convergence and prioritisation.\n- **Time:** 30–40 mins\n\n#### 5. **Define Success Metrics (Key Results)**\n\n**Structures:** _Helping Heuristics_ or _User Experience Fishbowl_\n\n- **Goal:** Develop measurable, outcome-oriented Key Results.\n- **Practices:** Collaborative iteration, strategic validation.\n- **Time:** 30–45 mins\n\n#### 6. **Align and Commit**\n\n**Structures:** _Wicked Questions_ → _Conversation Café_\n\n- **Goal:** Resolve tensions and formalise shared OKR ownership.\n- **Practices:** Frame productive tensions, clarify alignment.\n- **Time:** 30 mins\n\n#### ✂️ Optional Clean-Up: Remove Hidden Barriers\n\n**Structure:** _TRIZ_\n\n- **Goal:** Surface and eliminate behaviours or processes that undermine OKR success.\n- **Time:** 30 mins\n",

    "BodyContent": "This document aims to be a unifying reference for the community by offering the minimal guidance for Kanban. Depending on the context, various approaches can complement Kanban, allowing it to accommodate the full spectrum of value delivery and organizational challenges.\n\nThis guide has conventions for some terms. They are not meant to replace any other existing definitions but to clarify how they are intended to be applied here.\n\n## Conventions Used\n\n**Kanban or Kanban system:** the holistic set of concepts in this guide––specifically as pertains to knowledge work.\n\n**Stakeholder:** An entity, individual, or group responsible for, interested in, or affected by the inputs, activities, and outcomes of the Kanban system.\n\n**Value:** Either a potential or realized benefit for a stakeholder. Examples include meeting the needs of the customer, the end-user, the organization, and the environment.\n\n**Visualize, visualization:** Any method to convey ideas effectively, including conceptual clarification, not necessarily only visual.\n\n**Risk:** The chance that something bad could happen.\n\n## Definition of Kanban\n\nKanban is a strategy for optimizing the flow of value through a process. It comprises the following three practices working in tandem:\n\n- Defining and visualizing a workflow\n- Actively managing items in a workflow\n- Improving a workflow\n\nIn their implementation, these Kanban practices are collectively called a Kanban system. Those who participate in the value delivery of a Kanban system are called Kanban system members.\n\n## Why Use Kanban?\n\nCentral to the definition of Kanban is the concept of flow. Flow is the movement of potential value through a system. As most workflows exist to optimize value, the strategy of Kanban is to optimize value by optimizing flow. Value optimization means striving to find the right balance of effectiveness, efficiency, and predictability:\n\n- An effective workflow delivers what stakeholders want when they want it.\n- An efficient workflow allocates available economic resources as optimally as possible to deliver value.\n- A predictable workflow means being able to accurately forecast value delivery within an acceptable degree of uncertainty.\n\nThe strategy of Kanban is to get Kanban system members to ask the right questions sooner as part of a continuous improvement effort in pursuit of these goals. Kanban system members should aim for a sustainable balance among these three elements. Ultimately, the strategy of Kanban is to help you understand trade-offs and manage risk.\n\nBecause Kanban can work with virtually any workflow, its application is not limited to any specific industry or context. Professional knowledge workers in finance, utilities, healthcare, and software (to name a few) have benefited from Kanban practices. Kanban can be used at any scale and in most contexts where value is delivered.\n\n## Kanban Theory\n\nKanban draws on established flow theory, including but not limited to systems thinking, lean principles, queuing theory (batch size and queue size), variation, and quality control. Continually improving a Kanban system based on these theories is one way organizations can attempt to optimize the delivery of value.\n\nMany existing value-oriented approaches share the theory upon which Kanban is based. Because of these similarities, Kanban can and should be used to augment those delivery techniques.\n\n## Kanban Practices\n\n### Defining and Visualizing the Workflow\n\nOptimizing flow requires defining what flow means in a given context. The explicit shared understanding of flow among Kanban system members within their context is called a Definition of Workflow (DoW). DoW is a fundamental concept of Kanban. All other elements of this guide depend heavily on how workflow is defined.\n\n**At a minimum,** Kanban system members must create their DoW using all of the following elements:\n\n- A definition of the individual units of value that are moving through the workflow. These units of value are referred to as work items (or items).\n- A definition for when work items are started and finished within the workflow. Depending on the work item, your workflow may have more than one started or finished point.\n- One or more defined states that the work items flow through from started to finished. Any work items between a started point and a finished point are considered work in progress (WIP).\n- A definition of how WIP will be controlled from started to finished.\n- Explicit policies about how work items can flow through each state from started to finished.\n- A service level expectation (SLE), which is a forecast of how long it should take a work item to flow from started to finished. The SLE itself has two parts: a period of elapsed time and a probability associated with that period (e.g., “85% of work items will be finished in eight days or less”). The SLE should be based on historical cycle time and, once calculated, should be visualized on the DoW. If historical cycle time data does not exist, a best guess will do until there is enough historical data for a proper SLE calculation.\n  The order in which these are implemented is not important as long as they are all adopted.\n\nKanban system members often require additional DoW elements, such as values, principles, and working agreements, depending on the Kanban system members’ circumstances. The options vary, and there are resources beyond this guide that can help with deciding which ones to incorporate.\n\nKanban system members also often require more than one DoW. Those multiple DoWs could be for multiple groups of Kanban system members, different levels of the organization, etc. While this guide prescribes no minimum or maximum number of DoWs, it encourages establishing a DoW wherever the Kanban system members require connecting flow to value realization.\n\nThe visualization of a DoW is a Kanban board. Making at least the minimum elements of a DoW transparent on a Kanban board is essential to processing knowledge that informs optimal workflow operation and facilitates continuous improvement.\n\nThere are no specific guidelines for how a visualization should look. Consideration should be given to all aspects of a DoW (e.g., work items, policies) along with any other context-specific factors that may affect how value flows. Kanban system members are limited only by their imagination regarding how they make flow transparent.\n\n### Actively Managing Items in a Workflow\n\nItems in the workflow must be managed actively. Active management of items in a workflow can take several forms, including but not limited to the following:\n\n- Controlling WIP.\n- Ensuring work items do not age unnecessarily, using the SLE as a reference.\n- Unblocking blocked work.\n\nA common practice is for Kanban system members to review the active items regularly. This review can occur continuously, at regular intervals, or through a combination of both.\n\nKanban system members must explicitly control the number of work items in a workflow from started to finished. That control can be represented on a Kanban board in any way that Kanban system members deem appropriate. Ideally, the system would operate neither above nor below the agreed upon control.\n\nAn effect of controlling WIP is that it should create a pull system; Kanban system members should start work on an item (pull or select) only when there is a clear signal that there is capacity to do so. When WIP drops below the control set in the DoW, that can be a signal to select new work. Kanban system members should refrain from selecting more than the number of work items into a given part of the workflow beyond the WIP control.\n\nControlling WIP helps flow and often improves the Kanban system members’ collective focus, commitment, and collaboration. Any acceptable exceptions to controlling WIP should be made explicit as part of the DoW.\n\n### Improving the Workflow\n\nGiven an explicit Definition of Workflow, the Kanban system members’ responsibility is to continuously improve their workflow to achieve a better balance of effectiveness, efficiency, and predictability. Continual study of the system can guide potential improvements to the DoW.\n\nIt is a common practice to review the DoW from time to time to discuss and implement any changes needed. There is no requirement, however, to wait for a formal meeting at a regular cadence to make these changes. Kanban system members can and should make just-in-time alterations as the context dictates. There is also nothing that prescribes improvements to workflow to be small or incremental. If the Kanban system members feel that a significant change is needed, then that is what they should implement.\n\n### Flow Metrics\n\nThe application of Kanban requires collecting and analyzing a minimum set of flow metrics. They reflect the Kanban system’s current health and performance and will help inform decisions about how value is delivered. The four mandatory flow metrics to track in Kanban are:\n\n- **WIP:** The number of work items started but not finished.\n- **Throughput:** The number of work items finished per unit of time. Note the measurement of throughput is the exact count of work items.\n- **Work Item Age:** The elapsed time between when a work item started and the current date.\n- **Cycle Time:** The elapsed time between when a work item started and when a work item finished.\n  Provided that the Kanban system members use these metrics as described in this guide, they can refer to any of these measures using any other names they choose (e.g.,Cycle Time could be Flow Time, Throughput could be Delivery Rate, etc.).\n\nFor these four mandatory flow metrics, started and finished refer to how the Kanban system members have established those points in their DoW.\n\nIn and of themselves, these metrics are meaningless unless they can inform one or more of the three Kanban practices. It is up to the Kanban system members to decide how best to leverage these metrics (e.g., visualize them in charts, assess variation, etc.).\n\nThe flow metrics listed in this guide represent only the minimum required for operating a Kanban system. Kanban system members may and often should use additional context-specific measures that assist in making data-informed decisions.\n\n## Endnote\n\nOne can and likely should add other principles, methodologies, and techniques to the Kanban system. Still, the minimum set of practices, metrics, and the spirit of optimizing value must be preserved.\n\n## History of Kanban\n\nThe present state of Kanban can be traced to the Toyota Production System (and its antecedents) and the work of people like Taiichi Ohno and W. Edwards Deming. The collective set of practices for knowledge work, now commonly referred to as Kanban, mainly originated on a team at Corbis in 2006. Those practices quickly spread to encompass a large and diverse international community that has continued to enhance and evolve the approach.\n\n## 2025 Adaptations\n\n- To convey intent, conventions were added for: Kanban, Kanban system, stakeholder, value, risk, visualize, and visualization\n- Value realization could be for stakeholders, including but not limited to customers\n- Simpler definition of Kanban, specifically as pertains to knowledge work\n- Service Level Expectation was moved into the Definition of Workflow section\n- Less explicit (and hence more flexible) how WIP is controlled\n- More explicit about multiple DoWs, variation, connecting flow to value realization\n- Simplified the three practices, and select (items) is mentioned more often\n- Kanban Measures renamed to Flow Metrics\n- More explicit about the flexibility around flow metric names\n- Deleted reference to immutability of Kanban\n\n## License\n\nThis publication is offered for license under the Attribution ShareAlike license of Creative Commons, accessible at [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) and also described in summary form at [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
