    "BodyContent": "# OKR Guide\n\n**A Social and Quantitative Technology for Outcome-Oriented Alignment**\n**June 2025 Edition**\n\n## Purpose of the OKR Guide\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide a clear, pragmatic, outcome-oriented, and lightweight description of the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework. It defines the structure, accountabilities, and practices that enable outcome-oriented goal setting and organisational alignment.\n\n## Definition of OKRs\n\n_Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)_- are a collaborative goal-setting system used to align individuals and teams around measurable outcomes. OKRs consist of:\n\n- **Objectives**: Qualitative, inspiring, directional goals that articulate where we want to go.\n- **Key Results**: Quantitative, time-bound measures that define how we know we are making progress.\n\nOKRs are not tasks. They are not project plans. They are a lightweight mechanism for aligning strategic intention with measurable progress.\n\n## Principles Behind OKRs\n\nThe OKR framework rests on four irreducible first principles shaped by Peter Drucker, Andy Grove, and John Doerr: **Clarity of Purpose**, **Alignment**, **Measurement**, and **Accountability**.\n\n- _Clarity of Purpose_- — OKRs distil focus. Drucker advocated for shared and public objectives to unify effort. Grove operationalised this by insisting on fewer, well-scoped goals with clear metrics. Doerr reinforced the idea that inspiration must be grounded in execution; objectives must be motivational but paired with measurable key results.\n\n- _Alignment_- — OKRs promote shared direction. Drucker’s early MBO stressed aligning individual contributions with enterprise-wide goals. Grove extended this with cascading OKRs and bottom-up participation. Doerr championed organisational transparency, making every OKR visible to foster unity across teams.\n\n- _Measurement_- — OKRs insist on observable outcomes. Drucker warned against managing by intuition. Grove introduced Key Results as measurable indicators of progress. Doerr summarised this as \"measure what matters\"—metrics aren’t optional, they define what success looks like.\n\n- _Accountability_- — OKRs build a system of ownership and follow-through. Drucker envisioned self-management through mutually agreed-upon goals. Grove made OKRs a recurring practice of review and adjustment, decoupled from compensation. Doerr extended this with tools for tracking and public scoring, reinforcing commitment through visibility.\n\nThese principles are essential for transforming strategy into action. OKRs are not a reporting exercise; they are a framework for focused execution, continuous learning, and collective commitment.\n\n## OKRs and Strategic Planning\n\nOKRs operationalise strategy. They do not replace strategic documents, KPIs, or roadmaps—instead, they connect strategic intent with execution. A strong OKR practice ensures that:\n\n- Strategic themes and goals are expressed as quarterly OKRs.\n- KPIs are used as reference metrics when crafting Key Results.\n- Roadmaps inform feasibility and sequencing, but OKRs define outcomes.\n\nIn mature organisations, OKRs bridge the gap between annual strategy and daily work. They clarify what matters most now and how progress will be observed.\n\n## Prerequisites for OKR Implementation\n\nSuccessful implementation of OKRs depends on a set of enabling conditions that provide fertile ground for adoption and sustainability. Before introducing OKRs, organisations should ensure the following foundational elements are in place:\n\n1. _Strong Leadership Support and Sponsorship_- – Leaders must actively support and participate in the OKR process. Visible executive commitment signals importance, builds trust, and ensures prioritisation across the organisation.\n\n2. _Agile and Adaptable Work Culture_- – OKRs thrive in environments that value iteration, feedback, and adaptation. Teams must be empowered to inspect, learn, and pivot based on evidence rather than rigid plans.\n\n3. _Clear Organisational Vision and Goals_- – OKRs translate strategy into action. Without a coherent and shared strategic direction, OKRs risk becoming disconnected exercises. A clear organisational north star is essential.\n\nThese conditions are not optional. They are prerequisites that determine whether OKRs will become a high-leverage alignment tool or a misfiring compliance mechanism.\n\n## Events in the OKR Cycle\n\nThe OKR cycle typically follows a quarterly cadence and is built around four recurring events. Each event serves a distinct purpose in enabling alignment, focus, adaptation, and improvement throughout the cycle.\n\n| Event         | Timing          | Purpose                             | Facilitated By         |\n| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Definition    | Start of cycle  | Set direction and shared commitment | OKR Lead + Champion    |\n| Check-ins     | Weekly/Biweekly | Monitor progress, adapt execution   | OKR Champion           |\n| Review        | End of cycle    | Evaluate achievement and learn      | Team Leader + Champion |\n| Retrospective | End of cycle    | Inspect and improve the OKR system  | OKR Champion + Team    |\n\n### **Definition**\n\nThis event marks the beginning of the cycle. It brings teams together to define a small number of clear, strategic objectives aligned with organisational priorities. Each objective is paired with 2–4 measurable key results. The OKR Lead ensures strategic alignment, the OKR Champion facilitates the session, and all team members participate actively in shaping their commitments.\n\nThe Definition event should follow a structured format similar to:\n\n1. _Contextualise_- – Set the strategic context.\n2. _Reflect_- – Assess the current state.\n3. _Envision_- – Explore aspirational futures.\n4. _Focus_- – Select 1–3 objectives.\n5. _Quantify_- – Define Key Results using the standard format.\n6. _Commit_- – Agree as a team and publish transparently.\n\nA successful Definition event produces a coherent set of OKRs with clarity of purpose, strategic alignment, and strong ownership across the team.\n\n### **Check-ins**\n\nCheck-ins occur on a weekly or biweekly basis to monitor progress against key results. These events enable teams to adapt execution, surface blockers early, and maintain accountability. The OKR Champion leads the cadence, encouraging honest status updates and evidence-backed reporting. Team Leaders use check-ins to coach, re-focus priorities, and reinforce alignment. These are not reporting meetings; they are tactical forums for learning, problem-solving, and maintaining momentum.\n\nOKRs are a living system. Use frequent check-ins to:\n\n- Inspect progress.\n- Celebrate learning.\n- Adapt expectations based on evidence.\n- Re-align if strategic intent shifts.\n\n### **Review**\n\nHeld at the end of each cycle, the Review evaluates the actual outcomes against each objective and its key results. It answers: What was achieved? What wasn’t? And what can we learn from the results? The OKR Champion and Team Leader co-facilitate this session. The team scores each key result and reflects on performance. The Review event informs strategic planning, influences future objectives, and drives organisational learning. Accountability here is about honesty and clarity, not blame.\n\n#### OKR Scoring and Reflection\n\nScoring Key Results at the end of each cycle is essential for generating insight and driving learning. Common scoring systems include:\n\n- _0.0 to 1.0 scale_- – Google’s standard: 1.0 = fully achieved; 0.7 = strong progress; below 0.4 = off-track.\n- _Traffic light_- – Green (on track), Yellow (at risk), Red (off-track).\n- _Binary_- – Done / Not Done (suitable for binary results only).\n\nEach team should select a consistent scoring model, apply it objectively, and use it as input for retrospective learning, rather than performance management. Teams should also document lessons learned during scoring to inform future cycles.\n\n### **Retrospective**\n\nThis final event inspects the OKR process itself. It focuses on how well the team defined, tracked, and executed their OKRs. Were the objectives focused? Were the key results measurable? Did the cadence support delivery? Everyone participates in evaluating the system, and improvements are captured for the next cycle. The OKR Champion ensures a safe, constructive discussion, and the Team Leader supports adoption of agreed-upon improvements. This event reinforces continuous improvement and prevents stagnation.\n\nRetrospectives help refine the OKR process over time, improving clarity, engagement, and outcomes.\n\n## Roles in OKR\n\nFor OKRs to succeed, clear roles must support both the mechanics and the ethos of the framework. Each role contributes to a system of alignment, execution, and improvement. These roles are not job titles but functional accountabilities that shape how OKRs are defined, tracked, and adapted over time.\n\n### OKR Coach\n\nThe OKR Coach supports the adoption and maturity of OKRs across the organisation. They mentor OKR Leads and Champions, ensure consistency in implementation, and promote discipline in writing and evaluating OKRs. While not involved in day-to-day goal management, the coach serves as a steward of best practices and continuous improvement.\n\n### OKR Lead\n\nThe OKR Lead drives the implementation of OKRs across the organisation. They coordinate planning cadences, ensure strategic coherence across teams, and enable OKR Champions through training and tooling. The OKR Lead also facilitates cross-team alignment, monitors OKR health, and supports leadership with insights drawn from organisational OKR data.\n\n### OKR Champion\n\nThe OKR Champion owns the OKR process at the team or department level. They facilitate workshops, check-ins, reviews, and retrospectives. Champions promote transparency, keep teams engaged in their OKRs, and escalate blockers. They are operational anchors for the OKR cadence, ensuring the process remains lightweight, disciplined, and adaptive. They coach the team on applying OKR principles without adding ceremony.\n\n### Team Leader\n\nTeam Leaders provide the strategic direction for their teams. They ensure that team OKRs reflect organisational goals and that OKRs become part of day-to-day conversations. Leaders coach team members, remove impediments, and model accountability by sharing and tracking their own OKRs. They reinforce focus and discipline in execution.\n\n### Team Member\n\nTeam Members contribute actively to defining and delivering OKRs. They participate in workshops, provide updates during check-ins, and help evaluate outcomes in reviews. Each team member owns their role in achieving shared goals and contributes insights during retrospectives to improve the system.\n\n## Writing Effective OKRs\n\nWriting effective OKRs requires rigour, intent, and a shared understanding of purpose. Poorly formed OKRs undermine alignment and dilute impact. This section outlines how to write Objectives and Key Results that are both inspirational and measurable.\n\n### Objectives\n\nObjectives articulate direction. They are concise, qualitative, and designed to inspire commitment. A well-written objective provides clarity of purpose and drives focus.\n\n- They describe a desired state or strategic outcome, not a task or activity.\n- Each objective should align with higher-level organisational goals and reflect team accountability.\n- Objectives must be limited in number (typically no more than three per team) to maintain focus and coherence.\n- The language used should be action-oriented, grounded in relevance to the team, and specific to the quarter.\n\n### Key Results\n\nKey Results define evidence of success. They are objective, time-bound, and measurable.\n\n- Each key result should quantify progress toward the objective. If it cannot be measured, it should not be a key result.\n- The preferred structure is: `Verb + Metric from X to Y by [Date]`. This format makes both baseline and target explicit.\n- Key results must reflect outcomes, not outputs or activities. Delivery of a feature is not a result; the value it enables is.\n- Use 2–4 key results per objective. Fewer may lack clarity; more risks fragmentation and loss of meaning.\n\nWell-formed OKRs are simple, clear, and directional. They provide a shared contract for value delivery and a baseline for meaningful review. Rewriting, challenging, and refining OKRs is expected and encouraged. The goal is not to generate volume, but precision.\n\n## Sub-Optimal OKR Practices to Avoid\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls is essential for maintaining the integrity and impact of OKRs. Below are frequent sub-optimal practices that undermine alignment, weaken accountability, and reduce the effectiveness of OKRs:\n\n- _Task Lists Disguised as Key Results_- – Key Results should reflect measurable outcomes, not a to-do list. Replace vague activities with quantifiable evidence of change.\n\n- _Too Many OKRs_- – Attempting to cover everything undermines focus. Limit objectives to the vital few and resist the urge to track every possible metric.\n\n- _Top-Down Mandates_- – Imposing OKRs without team involvement leads to resistance and low ownership. A collaborative definition builds clarity and commitment.\n\n- _Misalignment_- – OKRs that don’t connect to broader strategy create confusion. Ensure vertical and horizontal alignment across the organisation.\n\n- _No Regular Check-ins_- – OKRs set and forgotten are ineffective. Frequent inspection and adaptation are critical for learning and progress.\n\n- _Vague or Unmeasurable KRs_- – Ambiguity erodes accountability. If a key result can’t be objectively scored, it needs rework.\n\n- _Tying OKRs to Compensation_- – Linking OKRs to pay or performance ratings discourages ambition and honesty. Keep OKRs aspirational, not evaluative.\n\n- _Binary Thinking_- – All-or-nothing key results miss nuance. Use scaled outcomes or multiple indicators where appropriate to better reflect reality.\n\n## Final Words\n\nOKRs are not a silver bullet. They are a collaborative discipline. When used with rigour, transparency, and commitment, they become a social and quantitative system for aligning intent with action. Start with clarity. Stay with it through learning.\n\n## Appendix A: Open Space Technology for OKR Collaboration\n\nOpen Space Technology (OST) is a facilitation approach that supports self-organisation, emergent priorities, and rapid group learning, making it well-suited for use alongside OKRs. Introduced by Harrison Owen and applied widely through OpenSpace Agility, OST enables cross-functional collaboration in complex and time-sensitive environments.\n\nOST is particularly powerful when the following conditions are present:\n\n- A topic of urgent strategic importance\n- A diverse group of stakeholders with differing views\n- High complexity, potential for conflict, or interdependence\n\n### Core Characteristics\n\nOpen Space requires very little upfront structure. Instead of imposing a pre-defined agenda, participants co-create their own. The result is high engagement and personal ownership over outcomes. The format typically includes:\n\n- A clear and compelling theme\n- A voluntary, committed group\n- A large, open space with movable chairs and breakout areas\n- A blank agenda wall and a flexible process structure\n\n### The Event Structure\n\nOpen Space events typically unfold across the following stages:\n\n- _Opening_- – Participants gather in a circle. The facilitator introduces the theme and invites anyone to propose topics for discussion.\n- _Agenda Setting_- – Individuals write their proposed sessions on paper, announce them to the group, and post them on the agenda wall.\n- _Marketplace_- – Attendees choose which sessions to attend based on interest and relevance.\n- _Sessions_- – Multiple parallel conversations happen, each self-managed by participants.\n- _Evening News_- – Informal summaries of learning and outcomes are shared.\n- _Closing_- – A reflection circle where participants share takeaways and proposed next steps.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nOpen Space runs on four principles and one law:\n\n1. **Whoever comes are the right person**\n2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have**\n3. **Whenever it starts is the right time**\n4. **When it’s over, it’s over**\n\n**The Law of Two Feet**: If you find yourself in a situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet to go somewhere else where you can.\n\n### Open Space + OKRs\n\nOST is an ideal companion to OKR Definition or Reset events, especially in organisations:\n\n- Beginning a major transformation\n- Dealing with fragmentation or poor engagement\n- Seeking to decentralise strategic ownership\n\nYou can use Open Space:\n\n- To generate themes and strategic topics for future OKRs\n- As a mid-cycle alignment and issue-surfacing mechanism\n- For large-scale retrospectives at the end of OKR cycles\n- To build a sense of shared ownership across boundaries\n\nBecause participants choose the conversations that matter to them, Open Space surfaces hidden tensions, identifies emerging opportunities, and reinforces the principle of outcome ownership. It’s not just a facilitation method; it’s a social technology that unlocks collective intelligence and aligns diverse teams without prescription.\n\nOST and OKRs work together to strengthen collaboration, autonomy, and focus, enabling your organisation to adapt in real time while staying strategically aligned.\n\n## Appendix B: Sample OKR Definition Workshop\n\n### Liberating Structures-based OKR Definition Workshop Design\n\nThis workshop format integrates OKR best practices and Liberating Structures to support high engagement, clarity, and alignment throughout the OKR Definition event.\n\n### Workshop Structure: From Purpose to Commitment\n\n#### 1. **Start with ‘Why’**\n\n_Structure:_- _Nine Whys_\n\n- _Goal:_- Surface and align around the deeper organisational purpose behind OKRs.\n- _Practices:_- Link to strategy, equal speaking time using paired conversations.\n- _Time:_- 20–30 mins\n\n#### 2. **Reflect on the Present**\n\n_Structure:_- _What, So What, Now What?_\n\n- _Goal:_- Reflect on the current state and past outcomes.\n- _Practices:_- Silent self-reflection, small group sense-making, full group synthesis.\n- _Time:_- 30–40 mins\n\n#### 3. **Envision the Future**\n\n_Structures:_- *Appreciative Interviews → *25/10 Crowdsourcing\n\n- _Goal:_- Imagine meaningful future outcomes through stories of success and bold ideation.\n- _Practices:_- Invite divergence and universal participation.\n- _Time:_- 45 mins\n\n#### 4. **Focus and Refine**\n\n_Structures:_ - *1-2-4-All → *Min Specs\n\n- _Goal:_- Distil vision into 1–3 clear, focused objectives.\n- _Practices:_- Transition from idea generation to convergence and prioritisation.\n- _Time:_- 30–40 mins\n\n#### 5. **Define Success Metrics (Key Results)**\n\n_Structures:_ - *Helping Heuristics - or *User Experience Fishbowl\n\n- _Goal:_- Develop measurable, outcome-oriented Key Results.\n- _Practices:_- Collaborative iteration, strategic validation.\n- _Time:_- 30–45 mins\n\n#### 6. **Align and Commit**\n\n_Structures:_ - *Wicked Questions → *Conversation Café\n\n- _Goal:_- Resolve tensions and formalise shared OKR ownership.\n- _Practices:_- Frame productive tensions, clarify alignment.\n- _Time:_- 30 mins\n\n#### Optional Clean-Up: Remove Hidden Barriers\n\n_Structure:_- _TRIZ_\n\n- _Goal:_- Surface and eliminate behaviours or processes that undermine OKR success.\n- _Time:_- 30 mins\n\n### Summary of Integrated Best Practices\n\n| Best Practice        | Structures That Support It                                         |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| _Mind the Dynamics_- | Nine Whys, What/So What/Now What, 25/10, 1-2-4-All                 |\n| _Balance Thinking_-  | Appreciative Interviews, 1-2-4-All → Min Specs, Helping Heuristics |\n| _Healthy Debate_-    | Min Specs, Fishbowl, Wicked Questions, TRIZ                        |\n| _Keep It Simple_-    | Focus & Refine, Helping Heuristics, TRIZ                           |\n| _Link to Strategy_-  | Nine Whys, Define Metrics, Conversation Café                       |\n\n---\n",

    "BodyContent": "This document aims to be a unifying reference for the community by offering the minimal guidance for Kanban. Depending on the context, various approaches can complement Kanban, allowing it to accommodate the full spectrum of value delivery and organizational challenges.\n\nThis guide has conventions for some terms. They are not meant to replace any other existing definitions but to clarify how they are intended to be applied here.\n\n## Conventions Used\n\n**Kanban or Kanban system:** the holistic set of concepts in this guide––specifically as pertains to knowledge work.\n\n**Stakeholder:** An entity, individual, or group responsible for, interested in, or affected by the inputs, activities, and outcomes of the Kanban system.\n\n**Value:** Either a potential or realized benefit for a stakeholder. Examples include meeting the needs of the customer, the end-user, the organization, and the environment.\n\n**Visualize, visualization:** Any method to convey ideas effectively, including conceptual clarification, not necessarily only visual.\n\n**Risk:** The chance that something bad could happen.\n\n## Definition of Kanban\n\nKanban is a strategy for optimizing the flow of value through a process. It comprises the following three practices working in tandem:\n\n- Defining and visualizing a workflow\n- Actively managing items in a workflow\n- Improving a workflow\n\nIn their implementation, these Kanban practices are collectively called a Kanban system. Those who participate in the value delivery of a Kanban system are called Kanban system members.\n\n## Why Use Kanban?\n\nCentral to the definition of Kanban is the concept of flow. Flow is the movement of potential value through a system. As most workflows exist to optimize value, the strategy of Kanban is to optimize value by optimizing flow. Value optimization means striving to find the right balance of effectiveness, efficiency, and predictability:\n\n- An effective workflow delivers what stakeholders want when they want it.\n- An efficient workflow allocates available economic resources as optimally as possible to deliver value.\n- A predictable workflow means being able to accurately forecast value delivery within an acceptable degree of uncertainty.\n\nThe strategy of Kanban is to get Kanban system members to ask the right questions sooner as part of a continuous improvement effort in pursuit of these goals. Kanban system members should aim for a sustainable balance among these three elements. Ultimately, the strategy of Kanban is to help you understand trade-offs and manage risk.\n\nBecause Kanban can work with virtually any workflow, its application is not limited to any specific industry or context. Professional knowledge workers in finance, utilities, healthcare, and software (to name a few) have benefited from Kanban practices. Kanban can be used at any scale and in most contexts where value is delivered.\n\n## Kanban Theory\n\nKanban draws on established flow theory, including but not limited to systems thinking, lean principles, queuing theory (batch size and queue size), variation, and quality control. Continually improving a Kanban system based on these theories is one way organizations can attempt to optimize the delivery of value.\n\nMany existing value-oriented approaches share the theory upon which Kanban is based. Because of these similarities, Kanban can and should be used to augment those delivery techniques.\n\n## Kanban Practices\n\n### Defining and Visualizing the Workflow\n\nOptimizing flow requires defining what flow means in a given context. The explicit shared understanding of flow among Kanban system members within their context is called a Definition of Workflow (DoW). DoW is a fundamental concept of Kanban. All other elements of this guide depend heavily on how workflow is defined.\n\n**At a minimum,** Kanban system members must create their DoW using all of the following elements:\n\n- A definition of the individual units of value that are moving through the workflow. These units of value are referred to as work items (or items).\n- A definition for when work items are started and finished within the workflow. Depending on the work item, your workflow may have more than one started or finished point.\n- One or more defined states that the work items flow through from started to finished. Any work items between a started point and a finished point are considered work in progress (WIP).\n- A definition of how WIP will be controlled from started to finished.\n- Explicit policies about how work items can flow through each state from started to finished.\n- A service level expectation (SLE), which is a forecast of how long it should take a work item to flow from started to finished. The SLE itself has two parts: a period of elapsed time and a probability associated with that period (e.g., “85% of work items will be finished in eight days or less”). The SLE should be based on historical cycle time and, once calculated, should be visualized on the DoW. If historical cycle time data does not exist, a best guess will do until there is enough historical data for a proper SLE calculation.\n  The order in which these are implemented is not important as long as they are all adopted.\n\nKanban system members often require additional DoW elements, such as values, principles, and working agreements, depending on the Kanban system members’ circumstances. The options vary, and there are resources beyond this guide that can help with deciding which ones to incorporate.\n\nKanban system members also often require more than one DoW. Those multiple DoWs could be for multiple groups of Kanban system members, different levels of the organization, etc. While this guide prescribes no minimum or maximum number of DoWs, it encourages establishing a DoW wherever the Kanban system members require connecting flow to value realization.\n\nThe visualization of a DoW is a Kanban board. Making at least the minimum elements of a DoW transparent on a Kanban board is essential to processing knowledge that informs optimal workflow operation and facilitates continuous improvement.\n\nThere are no specific guidelines for how a visualization should look. Consideration should be given to all aspects of a DoW (e.g., work items, policies) along with any other context-specific factors that may affect how value flows. Kanban system members are limited only by their imagination regarding how they make flow transparent.\n\n### Actively Managing Items in a Workflow\n\nItems in the workflow must be managed actively. Active management of items in a workflow can take several forms, including but not limited to the following:\n\n- Controlling WIP.\n- Ensuring work items do not age unnecessarily, using the SLE as a reference.\n- Unblocking blocked work.\n\nA common practice is for Kanban system members to review the active items regularly. This review can occur continuously, at regular intervals, or through a combination of both.\n\nKanban system members must explicitly control the number of work items in a workflow from started to finished. That control can be represented on a Kanban board in any way that Kanban system members deem appropriate. Ideally, the system would operate neither above nor below the agreed upon control.\n\nAn effect of controlling WIP is that it should create a pull system; Kanban system members should start work on an item (pull or select) only when there is a clear signal that there is capacity to do so. When WIP drops below the control set in the DoW, that can be a signal to select new work. Kanban system members should refrain from selecting more than the number of work items into a given part of the workflow beyond the WIP control.\n\nControlling WIP helps flow and often improves the Kanban system members’ collective focus, commitment, and collaboration. Any acceptable exceptions to controlling WIP should be made explicit as part of the DoW.\n\n### Improving the Workflow\n\nGiven an explicit Definition of Workflow, the Kanban system members’ responsibility is to continuously improve their workflow to achieve a better balance of effectiveness, efficiency, and predictability. Continual study of the system can guide potential improvements to the DoW.\n\nIt is a common practice to review the DoW from time to time to discuss and implement any changes needed. There is no requirement, however, to wait for a formal meeting at a regular cadence to make these changes. Kanban system members can and should make just-in-time alterations as the context dictates. There is also nothing that prescribes improvements to workflow to be small or incremental. If the Kanban system members feel that a significant change is needed, then that is what they should implement.\n\n### Flow Metrics\n\nThe application of Kanban requires collecting and analyzing a minimum set of flow metrics. They reflect the Kanban system’s current health and performance and will help inform decisions about how value is delivered. The four mandatory flow metrics to track in Kanban are:\n\n- **WIP:** The number of work items started but not finished.\n- **Throughput:** The number of work items finished per unit of time. Note the measurement of throughput is the exact count of work items.\n- **Work Item Age:** The elapsed time between when a work item started and the current date.\n- **Cycle Time:** The elapsed time between when a work item started and when a work item finished.\n  Provided that the Kanban system members use these metrics as described in this guide, they can refer to any of these measures using any other names they choose (e.g.,Cycle Time could be Flow Time, Throughput could be Delivery Rate, etc.).\n\nFor these four mandatory flow metrics, started and finished refer to how the Kanban system members have established those points in their DoW.\n\nIn and of themselves, these metrics are meaningless unless they can inform one or more of the three Kanban practices. It is up to the Kanban system members to decide how best to leverage these metrics (e.g., visualize them in charts, assess variation, etc.).\n\nThe flow metrics listed in this guide represent only the minimum required for operating a Kanban system. Kanban system members may and often should use additional context-specific measures that assist in making data-informed decisions.\n\n## Endnote\n\nOne can and likely should add other principles, methodologies, and techniques to the Kanban system. Still, the minimum set of practices, metrics, and the spirit of optimizing value must be preserved.\n\n## History of Kanban\n\nThe present state of Kanban can be traced to the Toyota Production System (and its antecedents) and the work of people like Taiichi Ohno and W. Edwards Deming. The collective set of practices for knowledge work, now commonly referred to as Kanban, mainly originated on a team at Corbis in 2006. Those practices quickly spread to encompass a large and diverse international community that has continued to enhance and evolve the approach.\n\n## 2025 Adaptations\n\n- To convey intent, conventions were added for: Kanban, Kanban system, stakeholder, value, risk, visualize, and visualization\n- Value realization could be for stakeholders, including but not limited to customers\n- Simpler definition of Kanban, specifically as pertains to knowledge work\n- Service Level Expectation was moved into the Definition of Workflow section\n- Less explicit (and hence more flexible) how WIP is controlled\n- More explicit about multiple DoWs, variation, connecting flow to value realization\n- Simplified the three practices, and select (items) is mentioned more often\n- Kanban Measures renamed to Flow Metrics\n- More explicit about the flexibility around flow metric names\n- Deleted reference to immutability of Kanban\n\n## License\n\nThis publication is offered for license under the Attribution ShareAlike license of Creative Commons, accessible at [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) and also described in summary form at [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
