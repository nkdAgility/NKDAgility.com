We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
- **[Working software]({{< ref "/tags/working-software" >}})** over _comprehensive documentation_
- **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
- **Responding to change** over _following a plan_

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

We follow these principles:

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}) of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to [technical excellence]({{< ref "/tags/technical-excellence" >}}) and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
