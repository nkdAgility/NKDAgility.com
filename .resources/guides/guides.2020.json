While many organizations have reaped the rewards of agility at the team level, their traditional management practices impede deeper change that would enable true business agility. Agile principles and practices must spread beyond the Scrum Team in order for organizations to achieve the dramatic improvement that they seek in their business results.\n\nClearing the way for greater success requires organizations to examine the way they invest in innovation and quantify success. Organizations that think they simply need to deliver faster, without considering what they are delivering, are missing the greatest benefit of agility: rapidly trying out ideas, discarding those that don’t work, enhancing those that do, and uncovering new ideas from customers, employees, partners, and stakeholders. Being able to change investment strategies, quickly, based on new information, separates the companies with winning products and happy customers from those companies who are mere footnotes in the history of their industry.\n\nEvidence-Based Portfolio Management (EBM-PM) applies lean and agile principles to the challenge of investing to derive the greatest business benefit. It uses rapid delivery of small increments of value to run experiments, gather information, and adapt investment decisions based on evidence from the market. It sets clear aspirational goals to aid alignment and commitment and lets the people closest to the customer develop creative solutions that create real, measurable value.\n\n## The Way We Usually Invest is Wasteful\n\nRather than improving the benefits reaped from an organization’s investments, traditional portfolio management practices increase risk and impair the organization’s ability to pivot when new events arise:\n\n- Solutions are disconnected from outcomes. Organizations build a lot of things without clearly understanding the problem it will solve, or the opportunity that it will address. They undertake work with only vague notions of the outcomes they are trying to achieve.\n- Estimates are based on conjectures. From these vague proposals, the people who will have to deliver the solutions are asked to make unexamined guesses about cost and schedule based on minimal information, under extreme and artificial time pressure, during the annual budgeting process. Despite all manner of caveats, the estimates are enshrined in the portfolio management system, where they become non-negotiable commitments.\n- People are trapped by dictated solutions and coerced estimates. They are stuck in a vicious time-pressured cycle in which they can never take time to truly understand the problem or opportunity or devise solutions that might better hit the mark. As a result, they spend time and effort building things that may have no value to customers, with limited ability to change course if they find evidence that customers need a very different solution.\n- Solutions are crippled by early lock-in. When organizations view all change as bad, they limit their ability to learn from new information. Organizations can learn by delivering partial solutions early and frequently, but only when they overcome their bias for locked-down, change-managed plans.\n- Organizations are crippled by infrequent, exhaustive, and exhausting planning. Opportunities arise continuously, so when large tranches of funding are locked-in by relatively long-term (annual or longer) budgeting processes, opportunities that occur at other points in the year are often foregone. As a result, the organization lacks flexibility to respond to new opportunities. When new and better opportunities do arise, the change management overhead is so intense that rapid response to new opportunities is nearly impossible unless the sponsor is willing to spend a lot of political capital.\n- Risks are amplified by delay and denial. When the size of investments is huge, the risk of failure can be paralyzing, leaving budgets that are always “in discussion”. The opportunity eventually slips away when organizations require a high-fidelity plan that will meet all needs and address all risks, before it will invest the money to proceed. A better solution is to fund experiments to learn more, while adapting continuously to new information.\n\n## EBM-PM Principles\n\nEBM-PM seeks to improve business results by reducing waste and over-investment in work that adds little or no business value. It reduces risk by investing in small increments, and then monitoring the results of these on frequent intervals. The basic principles that guide this work are easy to understand:\n\n1. **Experimenting Beats Comprehensive Planning.** Improving business impact requires delivering products and services that help customers achieve better outcomes, within a window of opportunity, for a reasonable price, at an acceptable level of cost. Since the world is uncertain, you can’t plan what customers need upfront, or what they are willing to pay, and since you can’t predict what customers will need, you can’t predict how much it will cost. This is why you need to work iteratively and empirically in order to achieve superior business results. Running focused experiments is the only way to move ahead in an uncertain world.\n\n2. **Making Smaller Bets Reduces Avoidable Loss.** Funding product or service development in a series of experiments lets organizations test new ideas quickly, allowing the ideas that won’t work to be identified quickly. This lets you focus on the ideas that are more likely to produce better results. Betting only a small amount minimizes the amount of effort you’ve “wasted” going down the wrong path when an idea proves to be unworkable.\n\n3. **Working on Fewer Things at a Time Finishes Them Faster.** Organizations generally have more ideas than they have capacity to pursue. When the organization tries to work on more ideas than it has capacity, they force teams to multi-task, which causes the teams to lose focus, and become less effective:\n\n   - Each initiative takes longer to deliver because teams lose effectiveness when they switch contexts between different initiatives\n   - Delaying value realization or feedback on value delivered deprives the organization of information it needs to make course-correcting decisions\n   - Delaying feedback causes organizations to waste time and money on things that later prove to be valueless once they get feedback\n\nWorking on fewer things at a time, eliminating multi-tasking, helps organizations focus so that they finish everything faster than they would if they took on more work.\n\n## How to Apply EBM-PM to Achieve Better Business Outcomes\n\nEBM-PM builds upon Scrum.org’s empirically-based continuous improvement approach called Evidence-Based Management (EBM). EBM-PM uses a continuous feedback loop to help an organization realize its goals more effectively.\n\n![EBM-PM Continuous Feedback Loop](images/investing-for-Business-Agility-Apr2020.png)\n\n## Why Budgeting Should Be Separated from Investing\n\nMany organizations combine budgeting with making investment decisions; they first see how many ideas, and how much they will cost, to determine how much they should spend on those ideas. The main problem with this approach is that at the time budget decisions need to be made, the costs and benefits of “ideas” is largely conjecture, and more planning effort does not improve the quality of the estimates. Organizations spend a lot of time and effort without producing very much benefit.\n\nThe amount of money organizations budget for product development and project work is largely constrained by other business concerns such as profitability, business goals, and the availability of people with the right skills. When setting budgets, a better place to start is to ask themselves, “what is the maximum amount we can afford to spend and still meet our profitability goals?” and base their budgets on that. This is not to say that they will spend that amount, but only that they could spend it.\n\nBudgets determine how many teams an organization can fund. Teams are the engines of work in a modern organization, and the number of teams an organization has determines how much work can be accomplished. Teams, here, refers to both individual teams, teams-of-teams, and value-stream-based organizations of virtual teams. Regardless, whether teaming is physical or virtual, teams possess both the expertise and capacity to identify and deliver the means of achieving goals established by the strategic planning process.\n\nDeciding what to spend it on is a different matter and is the focus of the Innovation Investment Cycle.\n\n## Define & Refine Goals\n\nEBM focuses on four kinds of measures:\n\n- **Current Value (CV)**\n- **Time-to-Market (T2M)**\n- **Ability to Innovate (A2I)**\n- **Unrealized Value (UV)**\n\nGoals should target closing a gap between Current and Unrealized Value. Organizational goals are generally expressed in terms of closing some gap between the Current Value and Unrealized Value, usually focusing on the value that customers experience. Closing this gap requires improving the outcomes that customers experience.\n\nGoals should be strategic and measurable. You will have lots of intermediate targets that you think you need to achieve en route to achieving the greater goal, things like, “Consolidate cloud platforms”, or “Reduce operating expenses by 30%”, but these are things that you want to achieve on the way to achieving something greater, like, “Improve product affordability by 30%, to reach more customers”. If you are struggling with understanding the goal in customer terms, ask, “what is the single elevating benefit to a customer if we achieve this tactical target?”\n\nGoals will continuously evolve. They will change as the organization obtains new information about competitive threats and customer opportunities. As your insights evolve based on this new information, you will want to revisit your goals, reordering them, adding new goals, and possibly removing goals that no longer are worth pursuing.\n\nGoals need to be continuously ordered and re-evaluated. As the goals evolve, based on new information, organizations need to re-evaluate their relative importance. Organizations should keep a Goal Backlog and continually refine it by identifying new goals, shifting the relative importance of existing goals, and removing goals that are no longer relevant.\n\n## Examine & Abandon Excess WIP\n\nEliminate all work that you can’t connect to your goals. Pet projects and random ideas have a way of sprouting like weeds, and even once-valuable work can lose its way or become less relevant over time. By working on them, you are taking away from making progress on something more important. In addition, goals change over time as well, and goals that were once important may no longer matter.\n\nTo ensure that your investments are contributing to your current goals, periodically take a look at everything you are doing, making sure that your work-in-progress is still contributing to advancing you toward your goals. For work that isn’t, kill it quickly, and focus on the work that will help you make progress toward your goals. Using people and resources that were being spent on non-goal work, look for places where you can contribute to achieving your goals faster. It doesn’t matter how much you have spent on something, the only important thing is what the work will enable you to achieve, and whether you have more important goals to reach.\n\n## Propose Experiments\n\nBecause teams are closest to the work itself, they are best able to identify ideas that might enable the organization to make progress toward their goals; this is sometimes referred to as utilizing “bottom-up intelligence”. Framing these next steps as experiments with expected measures will make it easier to evaluate the experiment’s success when they start gathering data on its effectiveness.\n\nThe proposals for these experiments need to express several elements:\n\n- The goal toward which the experiment is working\n- The groups of people that the experiment is targeting, and the outcomes the experiment hopes to improve for them\n- The thing that the experiment is going to produce (such as a feature or some process improvement)\n- The measures and values (including decision thresholds) that will show that the outcomes were improved\n\nTeams only propose new work when they have capacity. This prevents them from working on more than one thing at a time, which improves their focus, and reduces lost time and effort due to task-switching.\n\nIt’s worth noting that teams do not pull work that others define for them, nor are they assigned work. They consider the organization’s goals and propose work that expresses where they feel they can best contribute to reaching some goal.\n\n## Using Outcome-Based Product Release Roadmaps\n\nWhen working with defined products, organizations sometimes need to see where experiments are heading over time, so that they can understand the possible implications of going down a particular path. As an example, a team might propose that to improve customer experience for an application, they want to redesign the user interface in a series of steps, each of which would be expressed as an experiment, with the results measured. If, at any step, they fail to get the hoped-for results, they might abandon the entire series of planned improvements.\n\nExpressing these experiments as a series of features that are planned for each release would make it hard, if not impossible, to see the real goal. As a result, an outcome-based product release roadmap is a more beneficial way to express the intent of the proposed work:\n\n| Release     | Goal     | Beneficiaries     | Targeted Outcome | Evidence Target | Threshold  |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- |\n| `<release>` | `<goal>` | `<target groups>` | `<outcomes>`     | `<measures>`    | `±<value>` |\n\nDuring the Innovation Investment Cycle, Product Teams propose changes to their roadmap when they propose experiments, and based on the results of their experiments, they adjust their roadmap accordingly.\n\n## Evaluate Proposals\n\nWorking together, executives responsible for guiding investments, and the teams who make proposals, evaluate where the organization should “place its bets”. Since the proposals typically only cover what the team will work on for the next 1-4 weeks, discussions focus on the goals the teams want to contribute to, what they will do to move the organization closer to the goal, and how everyone will know if their experiments are successful (or not).\n\nThese discussions should not take long, since the investment interval is so short, and they do not delve into details about what the team will build, but focus on the reasoning behind the proposed experiment, and the sort of evidence that they will collect to show progress toward their goal.\n\nIn some cases, a team may not feel it can effectively contribute to the most important goal for the organization, and then the discussion shifts to whether they work on less important goals, or whether they need to propose some different experiment that will contribute to the organization’s top goal.\n\n## Run Experiments\n\nRunning the experiments is, quite simply, just Scrum; nothing else is required. When planning their Sprints, teams will want to think about how they will measure the success of individual Product Backlog Items, and they will need to build measurement into the product itself to collect the results that they will need to prove out their experiments.\n\nIn many cases, the only way to really gauge the value of an idea is to put it in front of customers; stakeholders, no matter how knowledgeable, are no substitute. As a result, building feedback collection mechanisms into the product release are especially important tools for validating hypotheses and guiding future investments.\n\n## Evaluate Progress Toward Goals\n\nThe investment-evaluate cycle allows organizations to inspect progress toward goals on a regular interval, and to adapt both roadmaps and goals. The length of this interval will vary from organization to organization; to be effective, it should be at least quarterly, but organizations faced with great uncertainties or changing markets should look for ways to improve this cycle to every 1-4 weeks.\n\nThese inspections involve all teams who are contributing to a goal, as they provide the ability to inspect results achieved and adapt the plans for the next step. Involving all teams contributing to a goal provides the teams with a way to identify cross-team dependencies that they need to work on when they plan.\n\nBased on information gained by running experiments and delivering product Increments to customers, as well as new evidence, executives and teams look at the results they achieved to collectively decide if they should keep going down the path described by the Product Roadmap, to adapt the roadmap, or to adapt the Goal. With these adaptations, the investment cycle begins again.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLinking investments to goals, measuring progress against those goals, and then inspecting and adapting both goals and investments, based on feedback, is the key to true business agility, and provides important benefits:\n\n- Guiding investments based on goals and letting teams propose experiments that seek toward those goals provides a better way to align work with business objectives by making goal pursuit the singular focus of the organization.\n- Frequently re-evaluating funding based on best available evidence gives organizations a better way to balance competing demands, to more effectively manage risk, and to redirect their teams to go after better opportunities when they present themselves.\n- Letting teams propose experiments and limiting their work to their available capacity leverages bottom-up intelligence and improves flow by reducing context-switching and team-level multi-tasking.\n\nGetting started requires only picking a small but strategically important part of your business, one that is beset with complexity and uncertainty, and applying the Innovation Investment Cycle ideas described above.\n\n© 2020 Scrum.org.

    "BodyContent": "### Version: 2020\n\nEvidence-Based Management (EBM) is an empirical approach that helps organizations to continuously improve customer outcomes, organizational capabilities, and business results under conditions of uncertainty. It provides a framework for organizations to improve their ability to deliver value in an uncertain world, seeking a path toward [strategic goals]({{< ref \"/tags/strategic-goals\" >}}). Using intentional [experimentation]({{< ref \"/tags/experimentation\" >}}) and evidence (measures), EBM enables organizations to systematically improve their performance over time and refine their goals based on better information\nBy measuring current conditions, setting performance goals, forming small experiments for improvement that can be run quickly, measuring the effect of the experiment, and inspecting and adapting goals and next steps, EBM helps organizations to take into account the best available evidence to help them make decisions on ways to improve.\n\nThis Guide defines EBM, its concepts, and its application.\n\n## Seek Goals using Empiricism\n\nComplex problems defy easy solutions, but instead require organizations seek toward their goals in a series of small steps, inspecting the results of each step, and adapting their next actions based on feedback.\n\nThis model has several key elements:\n\n- A **Strategic Goal**, which is something important that the organization would like to achieve. This goal is so big and far away, with many uncertainties along the journey that the organization must use empiricism. Because the Strategic Goal is aspirational and the path to it is uncertain, the organization needs a series of practical targets, like\n- **Intermediate Goals**, achievements of which will indicate that the organization is on the path to its Strategic Goal. The path to the Intermediate Goal is often still somewhat uncertain, but not completely unknown.\n- **Immediate Tactical Goals**, critical near-term objectives toward which a team or group of teams will work help toward Intermediate Goals.\n- A **Starting State**, which is where the organization is relative to the Strategic Goal when it starts its journey.\n- A **Current State**, which is where the organization is relative to the Strategic Goal at the\n  present time.\n\nIn order to progress toward the Strategic Goal, organizations run experiments which involve forming hypotheses that are intended to advance the organization toward their current Intermediate Goal. As they run these experiments and gather results, they use the evidence they obtain to evaluate their goals and determine their next steps to advance toward these goals.\n\n![Reaching strategic goals requires experimenting, inspecting, and adapting](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naked-agility-hypothesis-driven-480x450.jpg)\n\n## Setting Goals\n\nWhen setting goals, organizations must define specific measures that will indicate that the goal is achieved. Goals, measures, and experiments should be made transparent in order to encourage organizational alignment.\nConsider the case of the response to an infectious disease:\n\n- The Strategic Goal is to eradicate the effects of the disease, as measured by the number of people who fall ill and suffer significant illness. Measurement is important; in this example, the goal is focused on the effects of the disease, and not on the means for achieving the desired impact. For example, the goal is not to vaccinate a certain percentage of the population against the disease; that may be an activity necessary to achieving the Strategic Goal, but it is not the Strategic Goal.\n- An example of an Intermediate Goal is the successful completion of a trial of a vaccine against the disease. This is still ambitious and measurable, and achieving it may require the completion of many different activities, but it is seen as a necessary step on the path to achieving the Strategic Goal.\n  Examples of immediate tactical goals may include activities like isolating symptoms, evaluating a therapy, sequencing the DNA of a virus or bacterium, and so forth.\n- The Strategic Goal is usually focused on achieving a highly desirable but unrealized outcome for a specific group of people that results in improved happiness, safety, security, or well-being of the recipients of some product or service. In EBM, we refer to this as Unrealized Value, which is the satisfaction gap between a beneficiary’s desired outcome and their current experience. Unrealized Value is described in greater detail below, in the Key-Value Areas section.\n\n## Understanding What Is Valuable\n\nOrganizations measure many different kinds of things. Broadly speaking, measures fall into three categories:\n\n- **Activities**. These are things that people in the organization do, such as perform work, go to meetings, have discussions, write code, create reports, attend conferences, and so forth.\n- **Outputs**. These are things that the organization produces, such as product releases (including features), reports, defect reports, product reviews, and so on.\n- **Outcomes**. These are desirable things that a customer or user of a product experiences. They represent some new or improved capability that the customer or user was not able to achieve before. Examples include being able to travel to a destination faster than before or being able to earn or save more money than before. Outcomes can also be negative, as in the case where the value a customer or user experiences declines from previous experiences, for example when a service they previously relied upon is no longer available.\n\nThe problem most organizations face, which is often reflected in the things they measure, is that measuring activities and outputs is easy while measuring outcomes is difficult. Organizations may gather a lot of data with insufficient information about their ability to deliver value. However, delivering valuable outcomes to customers is essential if organizations are to reach their goals. For example, working more hours (activities) and delivering more features (outputs) does not necessarily lead to improved customer experiences (outcomes).\n\n## Four Key Value Areas\n\nIn addition to using hypotheses and experiments to move toward goals, EBM provides a set of perspectives on value and the organization’s ability to deliver value. These perspectives are called Key Value Areas (KVAs). These areas examine the goals of the organization (Unrealized Value), the current state of the organization relative to those goals ([Current Value]({{< ref \"/tags/current-value\" >}})), the responsiveness of the organization in delivering value (Time-to-Market), and the effectiveness of the organization in delivering value (Ability-to-Innovate). Focusing on these four dimensions enables organizations to better understand where they are and where they need to go (see\nFigure 2).\n\n![EBM focuses on four Key Value Areas (KVAs)](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naked-agility-evidence-based-management-768x394.jpg)\n\nEach KVA focuses on a different aspect of either value or the ability of the organization to deliver value. Delivering business value (Current Value) is important, but organizations must also show that they can respond to change (Time-to-Market) while being able to sustain innovation over time (Ability-to-Innovate). And they must be able to continually make progress toward their long-term goals (Unrealized Value) or they risk succumbing to stagnation and complacency. Example Key Value Measures (KVMs) for each KVA are described in the Appendix.\n\n### Current Value (CV)\n\nThe value that the product delivers today.\n\nThe purpose of looking at CV is to understand the value that an organization delivers to\ncustomers and stakeholders at the present time; it considers only what exists right now, not the\nvalue that might exist in the future. Questions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate\nfor current value are:\n\n- How happy are users and customers today? Is their happiness improving or declining?\n- How happy are your employees today? Is their happiness improving or declining?\n- How happy are your investors and other stakeholders today? Is their happiness improving or declining?\n\nConsidering CV helps an organization understand the value that their customers or users experience today\n\n> Example: While profit, one way to measure investor happiness, will tell you the economic impact of the value that you deliver, knowing whether customers are happy with their purchase will tell you more about where you may need to improve to keep those customers. If your customers have few alternatives to your product, you may have high profit even though [customer satisfaction]({{< ref \"/tags/customer-satisfaction\" >}}) is low. Considering CV from several perspectives will give you a better understanding of your challenges and opportunities. Customer happiness and investor happiness also do not tell the whole story about your ability to deliver value. Considering employee attitudes recognizes that employees are ultimately the producers of value. Engaged employees that know how to maintain, sustain and enhance the product are one of the most significant assets of an organization, and happy employees are more engaged and productive.\n\n### Unrealized Value (UV)\n\nThe potential future value that could be realized if the organization met the needs of all potential customers or users\n\nLooking at Unrealized Value helps an organization to maximize the value that it realizes from a product or service over time. When customers, users, or clients experience a gap between their current experience and the experience that they would like to have, the difference between the two represents an opportunity; this opportunity is measured by Unrealized Value.\n\nQuestions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate for UV are:\n\n- Can any additional value be created by our organization in this market or other markets?\n- Is it worth the effort and risk to pursue these untapped opportunities?\n- Should further investments be made to capture additional Unrealized Value?\n\nThe consideration of both CV and UV provides organizations with a way to balance present and possible future benefits. Strategic Goals are formed from some satisfaction gap and an opportunity for an organization to decrease UV by increasing CV.\n\n> Example: A product may have low CV, because it is an early version being used to test the market, but very high UV, indicating that there is great market potential. Investing in the product to try to boost CV is probably warranted, given the potential returns, even though the product is not currently producing high CV. Conversely, a product with very high CV, large [market share]({{< ref \"/tags/market-share\" >}}), no near competitors, and very satisfied customers may not warrant much new investment; this is the classic cash cow product that is very profitable but nearing the end of its product investment cycle with low UV.\n\n### Time-to-Market (T2M)\n\nThe organization’s ability to quickly deliver new capabilities, services, or products\n\nThe reason for looking at T2M is to minimize the amount of time it takes for the organization to deliver value. Without actively managing T2M, the ability to sustainably deliver value in the future is unknown. Questions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate for T2M are:\n\n- How fast can the organization learn from new experiments and information?\n- How fast can you adapt based on the information?\n- How fast can you test new ideas with customers?\n\nImproving T2M helps improve the frequency at which an organization can potentially change\nCV.\n\n> Example: Reducing the number of features in a product release can dramatically improve T2M; the smallest release possible is one that delivers at least some\n> incremental improvement in value to some subset of the customers/users of the product. Many organizations also focus on removing non value-added activities from the [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}) and delivery process to improve their T2M.\n\n### [Ability to Innovate]({{< ref \"/tags/ability-to-innovate\" >}}) (A2I)\n\nThe effectiveness of an organization to deliver new capabilities that might better meet customer needs\n\nThe goal of looking at the A2I is to maximize the organization’s ability to deliver new capabilities\nand innovative solutions. Organizations should continually re-evaluate their A2I by asking:\n\n- What prevents the organization from delivering new value?\n- What prevents customers or users from benefiting from that innovation?\n- Improving A2I helps an organization become more effective in ensuring that the work that it does improves the value that its products or services deliver to customers or users.\n\n> Example: A variety of things can impede an organization from being able to deliver new capabilities and value: spending too much time remedying poor product quality, needing to maintain multiple variations of a product due to lack of operational excellence, lack of decentralized decision-making, inability to hire and inspire talented, passionate team members, and so on.\n> As low-value features and systemic impediments accumulate, more budget and time is consumed maintaining the product or overcoming impediments, reducing its available capacity to innovate. In addition, anything that prevents users or customers from benefiting from innovation, such as hard to assemble/install products or new versions of products, will also reduce A2I.\n\n## Progress toward Goals\n\nThe first step in the journey toward a Strategic Goal is understanding your Current State. If your focus is to achieve a Strategic Goal related to Unrealized Value (UV), as is typically the case, then measuring the Current Value (CV) your product or service delivers is where you should start (of course, if your product or service is new then its CV will be zero). To understand where you need to improve, you may also need to understand your effectiveness (A2I), and your responsiveness (T2M).\n\nThe Experiment Loop (shown in Figure 1) helps organizations move from their Current State toward their Next Target Goal, and ultimately their Strategic Goal, by taking small, measured steps, called experiments, using explicit hypotheses.3 This loop consists of:\n\n- **Forming a hypothesis for improvement.** Based on experience, form an idea of something you think will help you move toward your Next Target Goal, and decide how you will know whether this experiment succeeded based on measurement.\n- **Running your experiments.** Make the change you think will help you to improve and gather data to support or refute your hypothesis.\n- **Inspecting your results. **Did the change you made improve your results based on the measurements you have made? Not all changes do; some changes actually make things worse.\n- **Adapting your goals or your approach based on what you learned.** Both your goals and your improvement experiments will likely evolve as you learn more about customers, competitors, and your organization’s capabilities. Goals can change because of outside events, and your tactics to reach your goals may need to be reconsidered and revised. Was the Intermediate Goal the right goal? Is the Strategic Goal still relevant? If you achieved the Intermediate Goal, you will need to choose a new Intermediate Goal. If you did not achieve it, you will need to decide whether you need to persevere, stop, or pivot toward something new. If your Strategic Goal is no longer relevant, you will need to either adapt it, or replace it.\n\n## Hypotheses, Experiments, Features, and Requirements\n\nFeatures are “distinguishing characteristics of a product” , while a requirement is, practically speaking, something that someone thinks would be desirable in a product. A feature description is one kind of requirement.\n\nOrganizations can spend a lot of money implementing features and other requirements in products, only to find that customers don’t share the company’s opinion on their value; beliefs in what is valuable are merely assumptions until they are validated by customers. This is where hypotheses and experiments are useful.\n\nIn simplified terms, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for some observation that has not yet been proven (or disproven). In the context of requirements, it is a belief that doing something will lead to something else, such as delivering feature X will lead to outcome Y. An experiment is a test that is designed to prove or reject some hypothesis.\n\nEvery feature and every requirement really represent a hypothesis about value. One of the goals of an empirical approach is to make these hypotheses explicit and to consciously design experiments that explicitly test the value of the features and requirements. The entire feature or requirement need not actually be built to determine whether it is valuable; it may be sufficient for a team to simply build enough of it to validate critical assumptions that would prove or disprove its value.\n\nExplicitly forming hypotheses, measuring results, and inspecting and adapting goals based on those results are implicit parts of an agile approach. Making this work explicit and transparent is what EBM adds to the organizational improvement process.\n\n## End Note\n\nEvidence-Based Management is free and offered in this Guide.

KVMs listed below are presented to show the kinds of measures that might help an organization to understand its current state, desired future state, and factors that influence its ability to improve.\n\n### Current Value (CV)\n\n| KVM                                                              | Measuring                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Revenue per Employee]({{< ref \"/tags/revenue-per-employee\" >}}) | The ratio (gross revenue / # of employees) is a key competitive indicator within an industry.
