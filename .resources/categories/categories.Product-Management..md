**Product Management: Balancing Vision, Value, and Viability**

Product Management is a strategic discipline, not a support function. It is accountable for aligning customer needs, business goals, and technical feasibility to maximise value delivery. This isn’t about writing requirements or running meetings; it’s about making tough trade-offs, prioritising what matters, and driving decisions that create measurable outcomes. Product Management, when done well, creates clarity from chaos and focus from fragmentation.

At the core of Product Management, within the context of Scrum, is **the Product Owner accountability**, or more broadly, the product strategist in Agile organisations. This role is **accountable for value**, not output. That distinction matters. Delivering more features doesn’t mean more value. In fact, most features don’t deliver any. Product Managers must act as ruthless prioritisation engines, ensuring the Product Backlog contains only what’s most likely to move the needle for users and the business.

Effective Product Managers work **within a social system**, not just a technical one. That means navigating stakeholders, aligning executives, collaborating with developers, and continuously engaging users. You need **a compelling product vision**, framed as an intermediate strategic goal, supported by clear outcomes and measurable progress. Without this, teams drift, customers disengage, and the backlog becomes a dumping ground for pet features and executive whims.

A modern Product Manager uses **evidence-based management** to guide decisions. You cannot optimise what you don’t measure. Use metrics like Time to Market, Current Value, and Ability to Innovate to inspect and adapt both strategy and execution. Avoid vanity metrics. Focus on evidence that enables learning and guides investment.

Customer feedback isn’t a suggestion box—it’s a strategic asset. Gather it continuously, synthesise it relentlessly, and prioritise it objectively. Use techniques like Opportunity Solution Trees, Jobs-to-be-Done interviews, or user story mapping. But don’t confuse listening with appeasement. Not all feedback should be actioned. Product Management is about **discernment**, not consensus.

Successful product strategies also demand **technical empathy**. Product Managers don’t need to write code, but they must understand what’s possible, what’s costly, and what’s risky. This is how you balance desirability, viability, and feasibility. You can’t decouple product strategy from technical architecture or delivery capability.

Finally, Product Management thrives in systems with clear **boundaries of authority and accountability**. The Product Manager owns *what* and *why*. Developers own *how*. The Scrum Master enables *how well*. Confusing these boundaries leads to dysfunction, misalignment, and blame.

In short, Product Management is a value-optimising function that sits at the intersection of strategy, execution, and learning. It’s not a job title; it’s an ethos. A relentless focus on outcomes, a commitment to learning, and a willingness to say no. You don’t need more features. You need better decisions.

- Product Management is a strategic discipline accountable for value.
- Product Owners must optimise the Product Backlog, not manage a feature list.
- Evidence-based metrics enable informed decision-making and adaptation.
- Customer feedback should drive strategy, not derail it.
- Technical empathy is essential for feasible and sustainable solutions.
- Authority must match accountability to enable effectiveness.

If your Product Manager is just managing Jira tickets, you don’t have a product strategy. You have a to-do list. Fix that.
