    Scrum is a **Framework** and a **social technology** for delivering **adaptive solutions** in complex environments. It is built on **empiricism**—transparency, inspection, and adaptation—and is designed to help teams deliver value iteratively and incrementally. Scrum is a **framework** that helps teams work together to solve complex problems and deliver high-value products. Its about planning.

    ## First Principals

    1. **Empiricism**: Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
    2. **Self-Organization**: Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.
    3. **Collaboration**: Scrum promotes collaboration among all roles to deliver the highest value.
    4. **Value-Based Prioritization**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.
    5. **Time-Boxing**: Time-boxed events are used to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
    6. **Iterative Development**: Scrum uses an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
    7. **Incremental Delivery**: Scrum delivers a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint.
    8. **Continuous Improvement**: Scrum Teams continuously improve through the use of the Scrum Events and by inspecting and adapting the product, processes, and practices.

    ## Values

    1. **Commitment**: The Scrum Team commits to achieving the Sprint Goal.
    2. **Focus**: The Scrum Team focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
    3. **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
    4. **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
    5. **Courage**: The Scrum Team has the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

    ## Accountabilities

    1. **[Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})** – Consists of a **Product Owner**, **Developers**, and a **Scrum Master**. The Scrum Team is **self-managing** and works collaboratively to deliver a **usable Increment** every Sprint.
    2. **[Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}})**: Accountable for **maximising product value** and managing the **Product Backlog**.
    3. **Developers**: Accountable for delivering **usable Increments** that meet the Definition of Done.
    4. **[Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}})**: Accountable for **Scrum effectiveness**, **causing the removal of impediments**, and **coaching the team**.

    ## Events

    1. **Sprint**: A fixed-length iteration (≤ 1 month) in which the team creates at least one usable Increment.
    2. **Sprint Planning**: Based on the Product Goal, the team plans the work for the Sprint.
    3. **Daily Scrum**: Based on the Sprint Goal the Developers plan work for the next 24 hours.
    4. **Sprint Review**: Based on the current state of the Product, current business conditions, and possible future business conduction the Scrum Team plans whats next.
    5. **Sprint Retrospective**: The Scrum Team plan on how they will change their system to improve the next Sprint.

    ## Artifacts

    6. **Commitments**
       - **Product Goal**: The long-term vision for the product.
       - **Sprint Goal**: A tactical objective for the Sprint.
       - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A quality standard for completed work.

    ### **Key Accountabilities**

    Scrum is lightweight, but **difficult to master**. It is **not a process or methodology** but a **framework** that helps teams navigate complexity through **empirical process control**.

    **Product Management: Balancing Vision, Value, and Viability**

    Product Management is a strategic discipline, not a support function. It is accountable for aligning customer needs, business goals, and technical feasibility to maximise value delivery. This isn’t about writing requirements or running meetings; it’s about making tough trade-offs, prioritising what matters, and driving decisions that create measurable outcomes. Product Management, when done well, creates clarity from chaos and focus from fragmentation.

    At the core of Product Management, within the context of Scrum, is **the Product Owner accountability**, or more broadly, the product strategist in Agile organisations. This role is **accountable for value**, not output. That distinction matters. Delivering more features doesn’t mean more value. In fact, most features don’t deliver any. Product Managers must act as ruthless prioritisation engines, ensuring the Product Backlog contains only what’s most likely to move the needle for users and the business.

    Effective Product Managers work **within a social system**, not just a technical one. That means navigating stakeholders, aligning executives, collaborating with developers, and continuously engaging users. You need **a compelling product vision**, framed as an intermediate strategic goal, supported by clear outcomes and measurable progress. Without this, teams drift, customers disengage, and the backlog becomes a dumping ground for pet features and executive whims.

    A modern Product Manager uses **evidence-based management** to guide decisions. You cannot optimise what you don’t measure. Use metrics like Time to Market, Current Value, and Ability to Innovate to inspect and adapt both strategy and execution. Avoid vanity metrics. Focus on evidence that enables learning and guides investment.

    Customer feedback isn’t a suggestion box—it’s a strategic asset. Gather it continuously, synthesise it relentlessly, and prioritise it objectively. Use techniques like Opportunity Solution Trees, Jobs-to-be-Done interviews, or user story mapping. But don’t confuse listening with appeasement. Not all feedback should be actioned. Product Management is about **discernment**, not consensus.

    Successful product strategies also demand **technical empathy**. Product Managers don’t need to write code, but they must understand what’s possible, what’s costly, and what’s risky. This is how you balance desirability, viability, and feasibility. You can’t decouple product strategy from technical architecture or delivery capability.

    Finally, Product Management thrives in systems with clear **boundaries of authority and accountability**. The Product Manager owns *what* and *why*. Developers own *how*. The Scrum Master enables *how well*. Confusing these boundaries leads to dysfunction, misalignment, and blame.

    In short, Product Management is a value-optimising function that sits at the intersection of strategy, execution, and learning. It’s not a job title; it’s an ethos. A relentless focus on outcomes, a commitment to learning, and a willingness to say no. You don’t need more features. You need better decisions.

    - Product Management is a strategic discipline accountable for value.
    - Product Owners must optimise the Product Backlog, not manage a feature list.
    - Evidence-based metrics enable informed decision-making and adaptation.
    - Customer feedback should drive strategy, not derail it.
    - Technical empathy is essential for feasible and sustainable solutions.
    - Authority must match accountability to enable effectiveness.

    If your Product Manager is just managing Jira tickets, you don’t have a product strategy. You have a to-do list. Fix that.

    Kanban is a strategy for change, not a tool or board. As defined in the Kanban Guide, it enables organisations to “start with what they do now,” understand their current system, and improve flow and value delivery through evolutionary change. It is rooted in Lean principles and systems thinking, focusing on how work flows rather than what work gets done.

    Unlike frameworks that prescribe roles or timeboxes, Kanban introduces observability: visualising work, limiting WIP, managing flow, and making policies explicit. This exposes bottlenecks and enables evidence-based improvement without disrupting existing structures.

    Kanban complements other approaches like Scrum and DevOps by improving transparency and decision-making. It does not require a reset or reorganisation. Instead, it guides teams to adapt their way of working over time, based on feedback and performance metrics such as lead time, throughput, and service-level expectations.

    Crucially, Kanban is often misunderstood as just visual task tracking. But its true power lies in creating a shared understanding of system behaviour and enabling strategic decisions about where and how to improve. It empowers teams to deliver value predictably, sustainably, and with greater resilience—making it an essential strategy for navigating complex, evolving environments.

    Instructions: |-
      **Use this category only for discussions on DevOps.**  
      DevOps is a philosophy that integrates people, processes, and technology to facilitate continuous value delivery, emphasising collaboration, automation, and shared accountability. The scope of this category encompasses the principles, practices, and cultural shifts necessary for effective DevOps implementation.

      **Key Topics:**
      - The distinction between DevOps as a philosophy versus methodologies or job titles.
      - The importance of flow efficiency over resource efficiency in delivering value.
      - The role of feedback loops in reducing risk and aligning with customer needs.
      - The necessity of automation in minimising errors and delays.
      - The concept of shared accountability among development, operations, and security teams.
      - The culture of continuous improvement and experimentation within DevOps teams.
      - Strategies for eliminating silos and fostering cross-functional collaboration.
      - The integration of quality and security practices early in the development lifecycle (shifting left).
      - The significance of observability and data-driven decision-making.
      - The ongoing journey of DevOps towards enhanced software delivery speed and reliability.

      **Strictly exclude** discussions that focus on unrelated methodologies, frameworks, or tools that do not align with the core principles of DevOps, such as specific project management techniques that do not incorporate the DevOps ethos.

    DevOps is not a methodology, framework, or job title—it is an **philosophy** or **ethos** that unites **people, processes, and technology** to enable **continuous value delivery**. At its core, DevOps is about **eliminating friction** between development and operations, fostering **collaboration**, and embracing **automation** to achieve high-quality, fast, and reliable software delivery.

    #### **The Philosophical Foundation**

    DevOps is built on principles that extend beyond tooling or process enforcement:

    - **Flow Efficiency Over Resource Efficiency**: Focus on the smooth, uninterrupted flow of value rather than just keeping teams busy.
    - **Feedback Loops as a Virtue**: Fast feedback reduces risk and ensures alignment with customer needs.
    - **Automation as a Necessity**: Anything repetitive should be automated—manual intervention is an opportunity for errors and delays.
    - **Shared Accountability**: Developers, operations, and security are jointly responsible for product quality and reliability.
    - **Continuous Improvement as Culture**: DevOps teams continuously experiment, learn, and adapt—there is no "done," only "better."

    #### **DevOps in Action**

    A DevOps-driven organisation doesn't ask, "How do we implement DevOps?" Instead, it asks, "How do we deliver value faster and more reliably?" The answer typically involves:

    - **Eliminating silos** through cross-functional collaboration.
    - **Shifting left on quality and security** by integrating testing and security into the development lifecycle.
    - **Embracing observability** to make decisions based on data rather than assumptions.
    - **Automating everything possible**, from infrastructure to compliance.

    DevOps is not a **destination**—it’s a **continuous journey** toward **delivering better software, faster, with confidence**.
