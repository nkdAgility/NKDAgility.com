    "BodyContent": "On the project I am currently working on we want to change the nasty [http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1](http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1) to a nice friendly URL on the website. This is pretty easy and can result in nice URL’s like [http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx](http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx).\n\nSee Also – [Solution - SEO permanent redirects for old URL’s?](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/01/04/do-you-know-how-to-maintain-your-google-ranking-while.aspx)\n\nUpdated #1 January 5th, 2010: \\- As suggested by [Adam Cogan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx), I changed the title and added a link to the Solution post.\n\n---\n\nThis has already been implemented by the CMS system that we are using, so what is the problem?\n\nThe problem is that Google thinks the URL to “Big Green Teddy Bares from Paris” is [http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1](http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1) and we need to tell them that it is now [http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx](http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx). The URLs’ are changing for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) reasons, but we do not want to loose any of the raking accumulated over time on the old URL’s.\n\nWe want to use **Rewriting** and not **Routing** because with [rewriting the change is handled before it is passed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/90112/iis-url-rewriting-vs-url-routing) to ASP.NET.\n\nRewriting in this case is like _**reverse**_ URL Rewriting and during this process I need to lookup the database to find the new KEY (“BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis”) and map the URL with the “ProductId” to the new “ProductKey”. If we also return a permanent redirect (301) then Google will learn the new location of the page and keep any ranking data associated with it intact. This is key as we do not want to start from scratch.\n\nThere are two official IIS7 rewrite engines that were recommended to me:\n\n- URL Rewrite\n- SEO Toolkit\n\n## URL Rewrite\n\nYou an install URL Rewrite from the “Web Platform Installer”, and it has very good integration and is easy to configure within IIS. This makes things a lot easier, but does it support 301 redirects?\n\n[![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_2.png)   \n{ .post-img }\nFigure: Adds an option right into the IIS interface\n\n[![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_4.png)  \n{ .post-img }\nFigure: You can easily add new rules through the integrated UI\n\n[![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_6.png)   \n{ .post-img }\nFigure: UI supports 301 redirects, but it does not seam to have any way to load from a database.\n\nWithout a way to load from the database there is no way it will solve the problem, and a quick Google shows that it does not support it. The closest it can get is using a key value pair mapping file, but with 30,000 entries I do not think that will perform well.\n\nIf you look at [Developing Rule Template for URL Rewrite Module](http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/519/developing-rule-template-for-url-rewrite-module/ \"Developing Rule Template for URL Rewrite Module\") you will see that you can only work within the set of options that are provided by the core functionality and can’t create a new feature, like loading the mappings from the database.\n\n## SEO Toolkit\n\nHaving looked at the [bumph for the SEO Toolkit](http://www.iis.net/expand/SEOToolkit \"SEO Toolkit\"), it does not look like it provides any of the functionality required.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe conclusion is that neither the SEO Toolkit, nor the URL Rewrite Module are of any use in this case. There are now two options, I can roll my own rewriting framework or use another one that already exists that supports extensibility. One such URL rewriting framework that spring to mind is [UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite](http://www.urlrewriting.net \"UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite\") which I have used before, but it has not been updated since April 2009. I have emailed the guys to ask them is they are still using/ working on it.\n\nEven though it has not been updated since April 2009, I think this is the best option. The source code is provided on the site, and I am familiar with the component. It supports a rule provider model that will allow me to achieve the goal I am aiming for and is very easy to setup.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [SSW](http://technorati.com/tags/SSW) [Software Development](http://technorati.com/tags/Software+Development) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have been trying since SP1 was released to get it installed at Aggreko, but due to our global, three time zones, development team and release schedules it has been very difficult to get some time set aside for it.\n\nNow that I am leaving, last day is Tuesday 17th November, there was more of an apatite to take the hit on time and get it installed.\n\nWhile I may be late to the game for SP1, I was conscious that a lot of gotchas around the installation had been reported when it was released.\n\nYou can find a full list on [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry)'s blog on his [Problems installing TFS SP1 post](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx), but I have to say that I have never had an install, except maybe 2010, go more smoothly. Its always the same when you take lots of precautions for Murphy's Law to rear its head, nothing goes wrong ;).\n\nWe have a single virtual server instance of TFS with the only architectural customisation is the link between TFS and our corporate MOSS environment.\n\n### Release Plan\n\n1. Turn off remote access to TFS websites  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-6-6.png)\n   { .post-img }\n2. Verify access to TFS is not possible remotely  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-7-7.png)\n   { .post-img }\n3. Run full SQL backup  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-8-8.png)\n   { .post-img }\n4.

Install VS2008 SP1 if client installed  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-1-1.png)\n   { .post-img }\n6. Install TFS2008 Service Pack 1  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-4-4.png)If any problems are encountered refer to Brian Harry’s post on resolving SP1 install issues: [http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx)\n   { .post-img }\n7. Follow test plan\n8. If tests fail, follow back out plan\n9. Done\n\n### Test Plan\n\n1. Check event log for errors  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-9-9.png)\n   { .post-img }\n2. Check all services are running  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-2-2.png)\n   { .post-img }\n3.

Test Visual Studio Access  \n    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-5-5.png)\n   { .post-img }\n\n### Back out Plan\n\n1\\. Restore last snapshot\n\n2\\. Start TFS website in IIS\n\n3\\. Test TFS Services by connecting through Visual Studio 2005 / 2008\n\n4\\. Test Web Access ([http://tfs01.northwind.com](http://tfs01.northwind.com))\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough there seemed to be a lot of noise around the time that SP1 was released, the great god Murphy left me alone in this instance. It just goes to show, simpler is better...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2008) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

While this can make it difficult for others to follow the actual thought process the benefits outweigh the cost of this and the random symbol orientation problems that most dyslexic people suffer from:\n\n- 3-D visualization ability\n- creative problem solving skills\n- intuitive people skills\n- visually interpreting information in 3d while applying a 4th dimension, reasoning.

    "BodyContent": "Well, nothing like hitting the ground running, my first job at SSW was to join the TFS Migration Team, it was a fun experience, let me tell you how it went.\n\nUpdate #1 20th January 2010: Have a look at our [Rules to better TFS2010 Migration](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/TFS/RulesToBetterTFS2010Migration/Pages/default.aspx)\n\n---\n\nAdam put a few guys together:\n\n- [Adam Cogan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx) (Australia) – The team lead who checks everything and makes us follow the [rules to better TFS](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx).\n- [Eric Phan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Eric.aspx) (Australia) – Created an excellent \"Rules to a successful migration from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 guide”\n- [Justin King](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Justin.aspx) (Australia) – Justin seems to play the part of devil’s advocate. I looked him up in the company directory and he is a previous employee…I guess you never really leave SSW.\n- Me (Scotland) – The implementer\n- [Allan Zhou](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Allan.aspx) (Beijing) – My co-conspirator for the implementation\n\nWe started at 2:30am (GMT+1) on Saturday morning and we did it in 5 major steps:\n\n1. Backed up TFS 2008 databases (Some 14GB of data)\n2. Restored databases to new 64 bit server\n3. Installed TFS 2010 Beta 2 64 bit\n4. Run the Upgrade of 2008 data to 2010 Beta 2\n5. Tested the deployment\n\nWe completed the migration at 9:15am (GMT+1) on Saturday morning so all in the migration took just less than 7 hours.\n\n[![image](images/SSWGoLivewithVisualStudio2010Beta2_15047-image_thumb-2-2.png)  \n{ .post-img }\n](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-SSWGoLivewithVisualStudio2010Beta2_15047-image_2.png)**Figure: Web Access – Working**\n\n[![VS2010](images/SSWGoLivewithVisualStudio2010Beta2_15047-VS2010_thumb-3-3.png)  \n{ .post-img }\n](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-SSWGoLivewithVisualStudio2010Beta2_15047-VS2010_2.png)**Figure: Visual Studio - Working**\n\nWell done to the SSW team.\n\nWell done also to the guys involved in the TFS team, the same migration from TFS 2005 to TFS 2008 was a much more painful experience taking days of work, but the guys from SSW made this process easy and straight forward…Preparation does that for a project…\n\nA possible claim to fame: In addition we might have been the first company (SSW is a company of 52 employees and contractors) to migrate. So far I have not seen any blog posts about other companies migrating everything over to Beta 2. I am a TFS MVP and no-one on that list has posted about a migration yet (I can just imagine Justin King having another fit when he finds that out).\n",

    "BodyContent": "In the last 2+ years at Aggreko I have worked with Visual Studio 2008 Team Foundation Server, Office SharePoint Server 2007 and a number of WPF, Silverlight and ASP.NET projects.\n\nThere had been some discussion of a new role within [Aggreko](http://bit.ly/8RqEwt) in the solution architecture arena. I also spoke to [Adam Cogan](http://bit.ly/6jCYnH) who has the title “SSW Chief Architect and Microsoft Regional Director”…\n\nThis fortuitous communication, which turned into an interview, resulted in an offer from Adam Cogan of employment as a Senior Software Architect at [SSW](http://bit.ly/5oZrwI)…\n\nI got through the interview and I decided to take a role at SSW…\n\n[![SSWLogo](images/Rulestobetteremployment_14DEF-SSWLogo_3-2-3.png)](http://bit.ly/5oZrwI)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you know of Adam, then you will know that he has [rules and standards](http://bit.ly/8ao5oP) for everything. If you have not heard of him, then I suggest that you have a read of those rules and see what they are all about.\n\nThe first set of rules that I read was the [Rules to better Email](http://bit.ly/75PYS9) and they helped me be more productive even before I accepted the job…\n\nCheck out rule [#32](http://bit.ly/67SSH9) in SSW’s “[Rules To Being Software Consultants Working In A Team](http://bit.ly/67SSH9)”\n\n> #### _#32 Do you enjoy your job?_\n>\n> _The expectation from Adam is:_\n>\n> - _#1 is to put your heart into your job and enjoy yourself_\n> - _Get your Employee Responsibilities (Scheduled recurring events) done_\n> - _Improve SSW to a better place every week_\n> - _Improve yourself to better person every week_\n>\n> _If you find yourself not enjoying your job this is not necessarily a bad thing. You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have decided you are unhappy you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making you unhappy. The fact is that there are some jobs that you are not suited to. It is probably best for everyone that you start to think about moving on and trying something that may make you happier._\n\nI totally agree with this and at Aggreko I was supported by many people. I spoke to my boss Andre Vermeulen about the things I was not happy with, and we came to an understanding, but it is difficult for a large company to move at the same pace that I do. I found working with SharePoint 2003 is really just unacceptable.\n\nIn my new role at SSW I will be tasked with:\n\n- bringing SSW’s rules to European clients\n- helping organisations be more proactive with the Visual Studio 2010 ALM offering,\n- migrating TFS 2005 and TFS 2008 customers to the joys of TFS 2010\n- enabling SSW to have 24 hour operations\n\nOn top of this I will be using SharePoint 2010 and CRM 2005 in order to implement intranets and CRM for clients.\n\nIts going to be a fun ride, and if you want to take your company to the next step and you are in Europe, please contact me.\n\nIf you get a chance, check out SSW’s Rules. I am sure you will find something that will make you more productive and happier…\n\n[![RulestoBetter](images/Rulestobetteremployment_14DEF-RulestoBetter_3-1-2.gif)](http://bit.ly/8ao5oP)\n{ .post-img }\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [Silverlight](http://technorati.com/tags/Silverlight) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [SSW](http://technorati.com/tags/SSW) [VS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2010) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2010) [TFS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2008) [TFS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2005)\n",

Compared to previous versions I was done before I started, like crossing an international date line. Another one is... no documentation... nope, I didn't look at it once! I would not recommend this approach, at least have a look to make sure you are installing the correct version on the correct URL's and to learn what the terms are.\n\nP.S. Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 any version without the Team Foundation Server 2010 compatibility pack WILL NOT CONNECT! The [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Service Pack 1 Forward Compatibility Update for Team Foundation Server 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d) is [available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d), but 2005 will not be available until RTM.\n\n[Visual Studio Team System 2008 Service Pack 1 Forward Compatibility Update for Team Foundation Server 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d)\n\nI should note that you should not complain about the limited support for 2005. Microsoft expects the install base to be less than 5% by the time Visual Studio 2010 is released, and they were not going to support it at all. That there is any support at all is due to the lobbying of the Team System MVP community and TAP customers and excelent communication with the product teams...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [VS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2010) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2010) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

    "BodyContent": "Although this post is called Scale Transform Behaviour you could use any transform / animation in its place. The purpose is to have a slider control in a menu be able to alter the scale of any number of controls within [MVVM](http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/the-philosophies-of-mvvm/) views.\n\n![image](images/WpfScaleTransformBehaviour_7143-image_-2-2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis behaviour allows you to add any Framework Elements to a list of attached controls by adding an attached property of GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaled to your controls.\n\n```\nPublic Class GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour\n\n    Private Shared sm_AttachedControls As List(Of FrameworkElement)\n    Public Shared ReadOnly IsScaledProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached(\"IsScaled\", GetType(Boolean), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(False, New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaledChanged)))\n    Private Shared sm_CurrentScale As Double = 1\n\n    Shared Sub New()\n        sm_AttachedControls = New List(Of FrameworkElement)\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Shared Function GetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Boolean\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n\n        Return element.GetValue(IsScaledProperty)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Shared Sub SetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Boolean)\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n        element.SetValue(IsScaledProperty, value)\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Shared Sub IsScaledChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)\n        Dim itemToResize As FrameworkElement = TryCast(obj, FrameworkElement)\n        If (Not itemToResize Is Nothing) Then\n            If Object.Equals(e.NewValue, True) Then\n                sm_AttachedControls.Add(itemToResize)\n                itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)\n            Else\n                sm_AttachedControls.Remove(itemToResize)\n                itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(1, 1)\n            End If\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nAs you can see, there is an attached dependency Boolean property defined with a PropertyChangedCallback. When the PropertyChangedCallback method is called we test to see if it is a True or False value and either add the control to a static list and set the current Transform, or remove the control from the list and reset the transform to 1.\n\nThis works grate and you can manipulate the list of controls at runtime by changing the dependency property.\n\n```\n<igWindows:TabItemEx\n

We need to add a ScaleValue attached dependency property to our Behaviour that we can bind to our single or set of control controls.\n\n```\nPublic Class GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour\n\n    Private Shared sm_AttachedControls As List(Of FrameworkElement)\n    Public Shared ReadOnly IsScaledProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached(\"IsScaled\", GetType(Boolean), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(False, New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaledChanged)))\n    Public Shared ReadOnly ScaleValueProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached(\"ScaleValue\", GetType(Double), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(CType(1, Double), New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.ScaleValueChanged)))\n    Private Shared sm_CurrentScale As Double = 1\n\n    Shared Sub New()\n        sm_AttachedControls = New List(Of FrameworkElement)\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Shared Function GetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Boolean\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n\n        Return element.GetValue(IsScaledProperty)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Shared Sub SetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Boolean)\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n        element.SetValue(IsScaledProperty, value)\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Shared Sub IsScaledChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)\n        Dim itemToResize As FrameworkElement = TryCast(obj, FrameworkElement)\n        If (Not itemToResize Is Nothing) Then\n            If Object.Equals(e.NewValue, True) Then\n                sm_AttachedControls.Add(itemToResize)\n                itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)\n            Else\n                sm_AttachedControls.Remove(itemToResize)\n                itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(1, 1)\n            End If\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Shared Function GetScaleValue(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Double\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n\n        Return element.GetValue(ScaleValueProperty)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Shared Sub SetScaleValue(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Double)\n        If element Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"element\")\n        End If\n        element.SetValue(ScaleValueProperty, value)\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Shared Sub ScaleValueChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)\n        If Not Application.Current.Dispatcher.CheckAccess Then\n            Exit Sub\n        End If\n        sm_CurrentScale = e.NewValue\n        SyncLock sm_AttachedControls\n            For Each itemToResize In sm_AttachedControls.ToList\n                ' Apply Tensform\n                itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)\n            Next\n        End SyncLock\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nThis value is stored so we can set new controls, and then applied to all of the currently attached controls. I have chosen to bind to a slider, but any way of passing in the required values is just fine.\n\n```\n<igRibbon:XamRibbonWindow x:Class=\"MainWindowView\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    xmlns:igRibbon=\"http://infragistics.com/Ribbon\"\n    xmlns:igEditors=\"http://infragistics.com/Editors\"\n    xmlns:igWindows=\"http://infragistics.com/Windows\"\n    xmlns:igDock=\"http://infragistics.com/DockManager\"\n    xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:Hinshlabs.WpfHeatItsmDashboard\"\n    Title=\"Heat Itsm Dashboard\" MinHeight=\"600\" MinWidth=\"800\" Icon=\"/Hinshlabs.WpfHeatItsmDashboard;component/HeatItsm.ico\">\n    <igRibbon:XamRibbonWindow.Resources>\n        <local:NinjectDataProvider\n        x:Key=\"ViewModel\"\n        ObjectType=\"{x:Type local:MainWindowViewModel}\"\n        />\n    </igRibbon:XamRibbonWindow.Resources>\n    <igRibbon:RibbonWindowContentHost DataContext=\"{StaticResource ViewModel}\">\n        <igRibbon:RibbonWindowContentHost.Ribbon>\n            <igRibbon:XamRibbon local:XamRibbonBehaviour.IsEntryPoint=\"True\" DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\" AutoHideEnabled=\"True\" Theme=\"Office2k7Blue\" >\n            <igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n                    <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu RecentItemsHeader=\"{Binding Resources.RecentItemsHeader}\" Image=\"/Hinshlabs.WpfHeatItsmDashboard;component/Images/heat.gif\">\n                        <igRibbon:ButtonTool Caption=\"Update\" />\n                    <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n                        <igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>\n                            <igRibbon:ButtonTool Command=\"{Binding ExitCommand}\" Caption=\"{Binding Resources.ExitButtonCaption}\"/>\n                        </igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>\n                    </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n                        </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>\n                </igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n                <igRibbon:XamRibbon.Tabs>\n                    <igRibbon:RibbonTabItem Header=\"{Binding Resources.Ribbon_HomeTab_Header}\">\n                        <igRibbon:RibbonGroup Caption=\"{Binding Resources.Ribbon_HomeTab_ViewsGroup_Caption}\">\n                            <igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                                <igRibbon:ButtonTool Caption=\"{Binding Resources.Ribbon_HomeTab_ViewsGroup_CallsViewButtonCaption}\" Command=\"{Binding AddCallsViewCommand}\" />\n                            </igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                        </igRibbon:RibbonGroup>\n                        <igRibbon:RibbonGroup Caption=\"{Binding Resources.Ribbon_HomeTab_OptionsGroup_Caption}\">\n                                    <igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                                    <igRibbon:ButtonGroup>\n                                        <igRibbon:ToggleButtonTool IsChecked=\"{Binding FickEnabled, Mode=TwoWay}\" Content=\"{Binding Resources.Ribbon_HomeTab_OptionsGroup_Flick_ToggleButton_Caption}\"/>\n                                </igRibbon:ButtonGroup>\n                                    </igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                            <igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                                <igRibbon:ButtonGroup>\n                                    <Label Content=\"Scale\" />\n                                    <Slider Minimum=\"0.5\" Maximum=\"3\" Width=\"200\" local:GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.ScaleValue=\"1\" LargeChange=\".5\" SmallChange=\".1\"  Value=\"{Binding Path=(local:GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.ScaleValue),RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}, Mode=TwoWay}\">\n                                    </Slider>\n                                </igRibbon:ButtonGroup>\n                            </igRibbon:ToolHorizontalWrapPanel>\n                        </igRibbon:RibbonGroup>\n                    </igRibbon:RibbonTabItem>\n                </igRibbon:XamRibbon.Tabs>\n            </igRibbon:XamRibbon>\n    </igRibbon:RibbonWindowContentHost.Ribbon>\n        <AdornerDecorator>\n        <DockPanel>\n            <local:UpdateView DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\" />\n            <igWindows:XamTabControl TabItemCloseButtonVisibility=\"Visible\" TabStripPlacement=\"Top\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding CallsViews}\" SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedCallsView}\" local:TabControlTimedBehaviour.IsTimedCycle=\"{Binding FickEnabled}\" Theme=\"Office2k7Blue\">\n            </igWindows:XamTabControl>\n        </DockPanel>\n        </AdornerDecorator>\n    </igRibbon:RibbonWindowContentHost>\n</igRibbon:XamRibbonWindow>\n```\n\n![image](images/WpfScaleTransformBehaviour_7143-image_-4-4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAs you can see I am heavily utilizing the Infragistics controls, but that would not affect this procedure.

    "BodyContent": "You have probably heard me go on about Unity a couple of times:\n\n- [My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/my.unity.resolveof-ninja.aspx)\n- [Unity and ASP.NET](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/unity-and-asp.net.aspx)\n- [Creating a Data Access layer using Unity](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/07/30/creating-a-data-access-layer-using-unity.aspx)\n\nI have been using what is now [unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity) since the good old days (sooo not true, WPF is the Windows Forms killer, and good riddance) of WindowsForms and CAB (Client Application Block), but now there is a lightweight alternative: [Ninject](http://ninject.org).\n\nI decided on my latest project (a Wpf dashboard for HEAT ITSM) that I needed dependency injection. Whenever I start building a [MVVM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx) project I always end up needing some sort of dependency injection to keep everything nice and neat. It is only really needed once you get to a certain size and when you start wanting talk between [ViewModels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel).\n\nAnyway I was using a method of injecting my ViewModels into the Views using standard binding:\n\n```\n<igDock:ContentPane x:Class=\"SlaTodayView\"\n    xmlns:igDP=\"http://infragistics.com/DataPresenter\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WpfHeatItsmDashboard\"\n    xmlns:igWindows=\"http://infragistics.com/Windows\"\n    xmlns:igDock=\"http://infragistics.com/DockManager\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    Header=\"Sla Today\" MinWidth=\"30\" MinHeight=\"50\">\n    <igDock:ContentPane.Resources>\n        <ObjectDataProvider\n        x:Key=\"ViewModel\"\n        ObjectType=\"{x:Type local:SlaTodayViewModel}\"\n        />\n    </igDock:ContentPane.Resources>\n    <igDP:XamDataGrid DataContext=\"{StaticResource ViewModel}\" DataSource=\"{Binding Calls}\" Theme=\"Office2k7Black\" >\n\n    </igDP:XamDataGrid>\n</igDock:ContentPane>\n```\n\nBut once you move to dependency injection you do not want to keep all those fixed object definitions. These may become interfaces, or you may just want to replace, or dynamically replace, one of these types by a derived one at runtime.\n\nThat being the goal, we need some way to retrieve that type even in design mode. There is nothing worse than components or bits of components that make it difficult to work in both Visual Studio and Blend, and with the new binding features of Visual Studio 2010 for WPF 4 it will be even more important that your usage is as compatible as possible.\n\nWhat I decided to do was create a custom [DataSourceProvider,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.datasourceprovider.aspx) called the NinjectDataProvider that I could use instead of the ObjectDataProvider. This is the first version of that provider and it does nothing more than retrieve the type form the [Ninject](http://ninject.org) Kernel. Minimal changes to the WPF enable this:\n\n```\n<igDock:ContentPane x:Class=\"SlaTodayView\"\n    xmlns:igDP=\"http://infragistics.com/DataPresenter\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:WpfHeatItsmDashboard\"\n    xmlns:igWindows=\"http://infragistics.com/Windows\"\n    xmlns:igDock=\"http://infragistics.com/DockManager\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    Header=\"Sla Today\" MinWidth=\"30\" MinHeight=\"50\">\n    <igDock:ContentPane.Resources>\n        <local:NinjectDataProvider\n        x:Key=\"ViewModel\"\n        ObjectType=\"{x:Type local:SlaTodayViewModel}\"\n        />\n    </igDock:ContentPane.Resources>\n    <igDP:XamDataGrid DataContext=\"{StaticResource ViewModel}\" DataSource=\"{Binding Calls}\" Theme=\"Office2k7Black\" >\n\n    </igDP:XamDataGrid>\n</igDock:ContentPane>\n```\n\nAs you can see, the only difference is highlighted above and shows the custom [DataSourceProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.datasourceprovider.aspx) in action.\n\n![image](images/WpfNinjectDojoTheDataProvider_C6CF-image_-2-2.png)  You can see from the image above that the designer capability is not affected with this actually loading from the database, nice!\n{ .post-img }\n\nSo, what do we need to do to achieve this marvellous result. its actialy fairly simple, I got out my trusty [reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/) and found that there is really only one method to override.\n\n```\nImports System.ComponentModel\nImports System.Threading\n\nPublic Class NinjectDataProvider\n    Inherits DataSourceProvider\n\n    Private m_objectType As Type\n\n    Public Property ObjectType() As Type\n        Get\n            Return Me.m_objectType\n        End Get\n        Set(ByVal value As Type)\n            If Not m_objectType Is value Then\n                m_objectType = value\n                Me.OnPropertyChanged(\"ObjectType\")\n                If Not MyBase.IsRefreshDeferred Then\n                    MyBase.Refresh()\n                End If\n            End If\n        End Set\n    End Property\n\n    Private Overloads Sub OnPropertyChanged(ByVal propertyName As String)\n        MyBase.OnPropertyChanged(New PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName))\n    End Sub\n\n    Protected Overrides Sub BeginQuery()\n        If m_objectType Is Nothing Then\n            Me.OnQueryFinished(Nothing, New InvalidOperationException(\"You must provide an ObjectType\"), Nothing, Nothing)\n        End If\n        Dim result As Object\n        Try\n            result = Application.NinjectKernel.Get(m_objectType)\n            Me.OnQueryFinished(result, Nothing, Nothing, Nothing)\n        Catch ex As Exception\n            Me.OnQueryFinished(Nothing, ex, Nothing, Nothing)\n        End Try\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nI do not yet need all the fancy features of [Ninject](http://ninject.org) yet so I have only implemented the bit that I need at the moment. If I am adding more (and get it working) I will blog about it in the future.\n\nTo get this working I needed to add an instance of an IKernel object to the “Application” file so I have a single Kernel instance through my application unless I want another, but this is a small price to pay and it could well have been done in the same way as the [My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/my.unity.resolveof-ninja.aspx) post I did on [Unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity).\n\nStart your [Ninja training](http://dojo.ninject.org/) today!\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [MVVM](http://technorati.com/tags/MVVM) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [VS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2010)\n",

It is concise without being boring and it provides a wealth of information on Silverlight 3.\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd it is in Colour! I never would have thought that this would make such a difference, I don’t really know why I thought this as I hate looking at code in notepad, but it makes it much easier to read the code pages, both c#/vb and xaml.\n\nBecause I have been using WPF for a number of years this book is perfect for me, although this is a reference book, It has a nice layout that is conducive to both learning and reference.\n\nWill I be hanging up my WPF hat and replacing it with a Silverlight one? Well, no… but Silverlight 3 is a big step forward…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Silverlight](http://technorati.com/tags/Silverlight) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I had previously created a Command Line Parser from [Ray Hayes](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=7917) codeproject article [Automatic Command Line Parsing in C#](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/commandlineparser.aspx). I had adapted it to VB.NET and upgraded it to .NET 3.5 but I recently ran into the problem with wanting a single command prompt application to handle multiple processes and multiple parameters. This would allow you to group all of a particular tasks commands into a single application. With the advent of Power Shell this format is increasingly less relevant, but with the proliferation of Power Shell many people still prefer to use the good old command line.\n\nSo, staring from the original [Command Line Parser v1.0](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=28451) code I wanted to be able to add multiple commands, or even nest commands. The result is a nice simple commanding architecture conducive to creating multiple commands.\n\n[![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_thumb_1-1-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nUsing this model I can create a simple command…\n\n```\nImports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser\nImports System.IO\nImports System.Collections.ObjectModel\nImports System.Net\n\nPublic Class Demo1Command\n    Inherits CommandBase(Of Demo1CommandLine)\n\n    Private m_PortalLocation As Uri\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Description() As String\n        Get\n            Return \"demo 1 command demonstrates a sinle nested command\"\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Name() As String\n        Get\n            Return \"Demo1\"\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected Overrides Function ValidateCommand() As Boolean\n        Return True\n    End Function\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Title() As String\n        Get\n            Return \"demo 1\"\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Synopsis() As String\n        Get\n            Return \"demo 1 command\"\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Switches() As ReadOnlyCollection(Of SwitchInfo)\n        Get\n            Return CommandLine.Switches\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Qualifications() As String\n        Get\n            Return String.Empty\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer\n        Try\n            CommandOut.Warning(\"running Demo1\")\n            Return -1\n        Catch ex As Exception\n            CommandOut.Error(\"Failed: {0}\", ex.ToString)\n            Return -1\n        End Try\n    End Function\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nOr something more substantial:\n\n```\nProtected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer\n    Try\n        Dim x As New Proxies.MyApp.Configuration.ConfigurationServiceClient(\"BasicHttpBinding_IConfigurationService\", m_PortalLocation.ToString)\n        x.ClientCredentials.Windows.AllowedImpersonationLevel = System.Security.Principal.TokenImpersonationLevel.Delegation\n        Select Case CommandLine.Action\n            Case QuiesceAction.Offline\n                x.QuiesceSource(CommandLine.Source, CommandLine.Message, New TimeSpan(0))\n            Case QuiesceAction.Online\n                x.RestoreSource(CommandLine.Source)\n        End Select\n        CommandOut.Info(\"Source {0} has been made {1}\", CommandLine.Source, CommandLine.Action.ToString)\n        Return 0\n\n    Catch ex As EndpointNotFoundException\n        CommandOut.Error(\"Unable to locate site. Check the value you selected for /Portal:{0}\", CommandLine.Portal)\n        Return -1\n    Catch ex As Exception\n        CommandOut.Error(\"Failed: {0}\", ex.ToString)\n        Return -1\n    End Try\nEnd Function\n```\n\nIf you are wondering where the variables come from, you can see form Demo1Command that a generic type of Demo1CommandLine is passed in. The application creates an instance of this which wraps the [Ray Hayes](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=7917) parser to provide the values from Environment.CommandLine used on the shared methods on the CommandLineBase class.\n\n```\n''' <summary>\n''' Created a command line object using the Environment.CommandLine information\n''' </summary>\n''' <typeparam name=\"TCommandLine\">The concrete type of object to create</typeparam>\n''' <returns>An instance of the object</returns>\n''' <remarks></remarks>\nPublic Shared Function CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})() As TCommandLine\n    Return CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine)(Environment.CommandLine)\nEnd Function\n\n''' <summary>\n''' Created a command line object using the Environment.CommandLine information\n''' </summary>\n''' <typeparam name=\"TCommandLine\">The concrete type of object to create</typeparam>\n''' <param name=\"CommandLine\">The command line arguments to parse</param>\n''' <returns></returns>\n''' <remarks></remarks>\nPublic Shared Function CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})(ByVal CommandLine As String) As TCommandLine\n    Dim instance As New TCommandLine\n    Dim parser As New Parser(CommandLine, instance)\n    parser.Parse()\n    instance.Parser = parser\n    Return instance\nEnd Function\n```\n\nThis parser then populates the CommandLine object with values from the CommandLine passed in. For example:\n\n```\nImports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser\nImports System.Collections.ObjectModel\n\nPublic Class Demo3CommandLine\n    Inherits CommandLineBase\n\n    Private m_value1 As String\n    Private m_value2 As Value2Values = Value2Values.Value1\n\n    <CommandLineSwitch(\"Value1\", \"Adds a string value named value1\"), CommandLineAlias(\"v1\")> _\n    Public Property Value1() As String\n        Get\n            Return Me.m_value1\n        End Get\n        Set(ByVal value As String)\n            Me.m_value1 = value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n\n    <CommandLineSwitch(\"Value2\", \"Adds and enum value called value2\"), CommandLineAlias(\"v2\")> _\n    Public Property Value2() As Value2Values\n        Get\n            Return Me.m_value2\n        End Get\n        Set(ByVal value As Value2Values)\n            Me.m_value2 = value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n\n    Public Enum Value2Values\n        Enum1\n        Enum2\n        Enum3\n    End Enum\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nWould allow you to call \\[consoleApp\\] Demo3 /v1:”Any value you like” /Value2:Enum3 and have the correct values populated at runtime.\n\nI have also updated with a DelegateCommand class that would allow you to call a function in the right format from anywhere:\n\n```\nNew DelegateCommand(Of Demo3CommandLine)(\"Demo2\", AddressOf OnDemo2Run, \"demo 2\", \"no additional information\", \"demo 2 command\", \"This command shows how to delegate the run method using the delegate command\")\n```\n\nThe delegate command is really easy in .NET 3.5 with the only change being the addition of a variable declared as a Func in the class:\n\n```\nImports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser\nImports System.IO\nImports System.Collections.ObjectModel\nImports System.Net\n\nPublic Class DelegateCommand(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})\n    Inherits CommandBase(Of TCommandLine)\n\n    Private m_Description As String\n    Private m_Title As String\n    Private m_Synopsis As String\n    Private m_Qualifications As String\n    Private m_name As String\n    Private m_RunCommand As Func(Of Integer)\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Description() As String\n        Get\n            Return m_Description\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Name() As String\n        Get\n            Return m_name\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer\n        Try\n            Return m_RunCommand.Invoke\n        Catch ex As Exception\n            CommandOut.Error(\"Failed: {0}\", ex.ToString)\n            Return -1\n        End Try\n    End Function\n\n    Protected Overrides Function ValidateCommand() As Boolean\n        Return True\n    End Function\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Title() As String\n        Get\n            Return m_title\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Synopsis() As String\n        Get\n            Return Synopsis\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Switches() As ReadOnlyCollection(Of SwitchInfo)\n        Get\n            Return CommandLine.Switches\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Qualifications() As String\n        Get\n            Return String.Empty\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Sub New(ByVal name As String, ByVal runCommand As Func(Of Integer), ByVal title As String, ByVal qualifications As String, ByVal synopsis As String, ByVal description As String)\n        m_name = name\n        m_RunCommand = runCommand\n        m_Title = title\n        m_Qualifications = qualifications\n        m_Synopsis = synopsis\n        m_Description = description\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nIf you were wondering why there are so many properties, it is to allow the help to be created automatically. For example if you call the help function on Demo3Command you will get…\n\n![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_-3-2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWith the values coming from the relevant places:\n\n![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_-4-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIt will also support inherited CommandLine objects to minimize duplication.\n\nI hope that if you are building command line apps that you will have a look, just remember not to spend too much effort on cmd, when Power Shell is much more suitable and accessible to non developers.\n\nGet [Command Line Parser v2.0](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31651)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject)\n",

    "BodyContent": "A colleague of mine was having a bit of trouble getting drag and drop working in a way that fitted well with the MVVM pattern. This is really quite simple once you have a certain level of understanding of Patterns, but is a complete nightmare if you do not.\n\nOne of the founding principals of MVVM is that you should never be writing code in your code behind, it should all be encapsulated away and be bindable in XAML to achieve the result. Anyone who has tackled drag and drip will have suddenly found their code behind covered in code for handling both the drag and the drop, and multiplied up when dealing with multiple controls.\n\nI cruised the web for information, of which I found plenty and settled on an example by [Bea Stollnitz](http://www.beacosta.com \"Bea Stollnitz on Silverlight and WPF\") of Microsoft. In her [post](http://www.beacosta.com/blog/?p=53 \"How can I drag and drop items between data bound ItemsControls?\") i had found one of the best and most intuitive examples of the Drag & Drop Behaviour written in C#.\n\nI am not going to go into all of her code which she has available for download, just to say that it is nice, and is exactly what I am looking for even with the limitations that she described.\n\nThe functionality available allows you to drag a piece of data from one ItemsControl to another of the same data type or to reorder within itself. It provides for a floating template for the dragging item and a visual cue for the drop location.\n\n![InsertionAdorner](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-InsertionAdorner_3-4-6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI wanted to augment this to allow for other scenarios while keeping as much functionality as possible.\n\nLikes:\n\n- Drag functionality\n- Drag templating – nice!\n- Encapsulation of logic\n\nDislikes:\n\n- No way to control drop behaviour\n\nMy version lets you inject additional functionality at runtime. The adjusted class diagram shows the relationships, but we only really use the DragDropBehaviour class\n\n![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_8-3-5.png) \n{ .post-img }\n\nYou can still use the standard options:\n\n```\n<DockPanel>\n    <Label DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\"  Content=\"Checkout\" />\n    <ListBox     hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDragSource=\"true\"\n                 hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDropTarget=\"true\"\n                 hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DragTemplate=\"{StaticResource MyTemplate}\"\n                 ItemsSource=\"{Binding Items}\"\n                 MinWidth=\"100\"\n                 MinHeight=\"100\"\n                 AllowDrop=\"True\"\n                 SelectionMode=\"Multiple\">\n    </ListBox>\n</DockPanel>\n```\n\nBut I have added another bindable option of DropProcessor that allows you to override the default DropProcessor to achieve whatever you want.\n\n```\n<ListBox hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DropProcessor=\"{Binding DropProcessor}\"\n    hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDragSource=\"true\"\n    hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDropTarget=\"true\"\n    hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DragTemplate=\"{StaticResource moo}\"\n    ItemsSource=\"{Binding Items}\"\n    MinWidth=\"100\"\n    MinHeight=\"100\">\n```\n\nIn this example I have created a little gun shop called “Nutters R’ Us” where you can buy weapons and ordinance. You can see that there is an area for weapons, and area for ordinance and an area for your selected purchases.\n\n![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_7-2-4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have added a custom DropProcessor only to the Checkout area that only applies when you drop items of type “OrdinanceViewModel”\n\n```\nPublic Class CheckoutDropProcessor\n    Inherits DropProcessor\n\n    Public Overrides Function GetDropAdorner(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal adornerLayer As System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer) As DropAdorner\n        If TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then\n            If TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then\n                Return New OrdnanceToWeaponDropAdorner(behaviour, adornerLayer)\n            End If\n        End If\n        Return MyBase.GetDropAdorner(behaviour, adornerLayer)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Overrides Function IsDropAllowed(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal draggedItem As Object) As Boolean\n        If Not behaviour.SourceItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then\n            If Not behaviour.TargetItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then\n                Return True\n            End If\n            Return False\n        End If\n        Return MyBase.IsDropAllowed(behaviour, draggedItem)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Overrides Sub Drop(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal draggedItem As Object, ByVal dropEffect As System.Windows.DragDropEffects)\n        If Not behaviour.TargetItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then\n            If TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then\n                CType(behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext, WeaponViewModel).AddOrdinance(CType(behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext, OrdnanceViewModel))\n                Dim indexRemoved As Integer = -1\n                If ((dropEffect And DragDropEffects.Move) <> DragDropEffects.None) Then\n                    indexRemoved = Utilities.RemoveItemFromItemsControl(behaviour.SourceItemsControl, draggedItem)\n                End If\n                If (((indexRemoved <> -1) AndAlso (behaviour.SourceItemsControl Is behaviour.TargetItemsControl)) AndAlso (indexRemoved < behaviour.InsertionIndex)) Then\n                    behaviour.InsertionIndex -= 1\n                End If\n                Exit Sub\n            End If\n        End If\n        MyBase.Drop(behaviour, draggedItem, dropEffect)\n\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\n![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_11-1-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis class inherits from the base class “DropProcessor” that provides the same functionality as the original article, but I have\n\noverridden couple of methods. The first, “GetDropAdorner” test to make sure that you are dropping a OrdinanceViewModel onto a WeaponViewModel and provides a different and custom DropAdorner that instead of providing the lovely insertion visual it just applied a “IsDropTarget” property to the ListBoxItem to allow a template to control the visual. The IsAllowedDrop also test for this case, as does the Drop method. In all cases they are just testing for a special case of Drop and call the base classes methods.\n\nThe diagram for the demo app is a little large, but you can see how much I still suck at MVVM, and although I have learned a lot doing this demo, I am still tempted to share ViewModels… but that is a bad habit.\n\n![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_-6-2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have highlighted the two main classes, and we have already discussed the CheckoutDropProcessor. This allows you the flexibility to augment your drop scenarios without all of your developers having to get too deep in the guts on the behaviour, thus leaving them plenty of time for the real work of actually building something useful.\n\nI have put this [up on Codeplex](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504), and both the [source](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504#DownloadId=79055) and [binaries](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504#DownloadId=79056) are available.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [MVVM](http://technorati.com/tags/MVVM) [Silverlight](http://technorati.com/tags/Silverlight)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I am always pulling out the Unity assemblies. Maybe it is just because I am lazy, but I really can’t be bothered rolling my own dependency injection and mapping framework!\n\n![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image_13-1-1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI am going to use Unity only as a mapping frame work for now, I want to be able to pass an Interface into a method, and get back the correct data access class.\n\nThe plan is to meet the diagram on the left. Only the factory and the interfaces are accessible, but are all set to “friend” which will require an assembly tag to be added to both the Factory and the Interfaces assemblies to allow explicit access.\n\n```\n<Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo(\"Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Services.Server\")>\n```\n\nThis allows classes in the named assembly to access all classes and methods that have been prefaced with the “Friend” access level. Its a sneaky way of helping to maintain your layer integrity. So with this reference added only the Services.Server assembly, the one with the web service implementation, can access the factory and the interfaces, making them un-callable from any other assembly.\n\nnote: if you use only the assembly’s friendly name and not the explicit signed name then someone could just create an assembly of the same name as above and they will be able to call as if they were Services.Server. This is not to prevent hacking, just those pesky developers (me) who may try to bypass the service tier…\n\nIf, like me you are running tests you will also need to add an InternalsVisibleTo entry for your test assemblies or you will be plagued by “Assessors”..\n\nFirst is my IDataAccess class, this is really only exists so there is some validation on my generics.\n\n[![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image34_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image34.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n```\n' Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common\nPublic Interface IDataAccess\n\nEnd Interface\n```\n\nI also have a more specific Interface that allows for the loading of Artefacts. I have not yet implemented anything more than get and add, but you can see that it inherits (yes an interface and inherits in the same sentence) from the IDataAccess interface so we can pass it as a generic type that complies with IDataAccess.\n\n```\n'Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common\nImports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Common\n\nPublic Interface IArtifactDataAccess(Of T As Artifact)\n    Inherits IDataAccess\n\n    Function GetArtifact(ByVal id As Guid) As T\n    Function GetArtifact(ByVal Uri As Uri) As T\n    Function GetArtifacts() As ArtifactCollection\n    Function AddArtifact(ByVal artifact As T) As Boolean\n\nEnd Interface\n```\n\nWow… that was hard, IDataAccess may have a little more than nothing in the future, but for now that is it. Now, what I need is a class that I can inherit from that will provide the functionality I need for any factory. This is mainly coz factories bread factories.\n\n![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image25-3-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n```\n'Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Common\nImports System.IO\nImports System.Globalization\nImports System.Xml.Serialization\nImports System.Configuration\nImports Microsoft.Practices.Unity\nImports Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration\nImports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Common\nImports System.Reflection\n\nFriend MustInherit Class UnityFactoryBase(Of T As {New, UnityFactoryBase(Of T)})\n\n#Region \" Singleton\"\n\n    Private Shared m_Instance As T\n\n    Friend Shared ReadOnly Property Instance As T\n        Get\n            If m_Instance Is Nothing Then\n                m_Instance = New T\n                m_Instance.Initialize()\n            End If\n            Return m_Instance\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected Sub New()\n        ' Do nothing in here\n    End Sub\n\n#End Region\n\n    Private m_UnityContainer As IUnityContainer\n\n    Private Sub Initialize()\n        ' Create Unity container\n        m_UnityContainer = New UnityContainer()\n        ' Configure Unity\n        Dim config As Configuration\n        Dim fm As New ExeConfigurationFileMap\n\n        fm.ExeConfigFilename = ConfigFilename\n        Dim configFileLocation As String = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetCallingAssembly.Location), ConfigFilename)\n        If Not File.Exists(configFileLocation) Then\n            Throw New FileNotFoundException(String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, \"Unable to load config file with the name {0}\", fm.ExeConfigFilename), configFileLocation)\n        End If\n        config = ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfiguration(fm, ConfigurationUserLevel.None)\n        Dim section As UnityConfigurationSection = CType(config.GetSection(\"unity\"), UnityConfigurationSection)\n        If section Is Nothing Then\n            Throw New AccessViolationException(String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, \"There is no unity section called {0} in the config file {1}\", UnityContainerName, ConfigFilename))\n        End If\n        section.Containers(UnityContainerName).Configure(m_UnityContainer)\n    End Sub\n\n    Protected ReadOnly Property UnityContainer As IUnityContainer\n        Get\n            Return m_UnityContainer\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected MustOverride ReadOnly Property UnityContainerName As String\n    Protected MustOverride ReadOnly Property ConfigFilename As String\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nThe UnityFactoryBase class provides a couple of features. It provides a Singleton pattern so that we make sure that there is only ever one instance per factory type T and we initialise a UnityContainer for each Instance of factory T. You can see that on the class definition the generic type T that will be passed in is of the same type as the class itself. This makes sure that the class that represents T inherits from UnityFactoryBase(Of T As {New, UnityFactoryBase(Of T)}). When configuring the Unity Container we get both the container name and the config file to load from the child class. This allows for both different config files per factory and the option to have a single config file and multiple unity configuration elements. Its up to you…\n\nWe need to inherit from UnityFactoryBase(Of T As {New, UnityFactoryBase(Of T)})  to create our factory and provide a config file to configure the UnityContainer. The inherited class is pretty simple as we have done most of the heavy lifting in the base class.\n\n![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image19-2-2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n```\nImports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common\n' Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess\nImports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Common\nImports System.Globalization\n\nFriend Class DataAccessFactory\n    Inherits UnityFactoryBase(Of DataAccessFactory)\n\n    Public Sub New()\n        ' Do nothing in here\n    End Sub\n\n    Protected Overrides ReadOnly Property UnityContainerName As String\n        Get\n            Return \"DataAccess\"\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Protected Overrides ReadOnly Property ConfigFilename As String\n        Get\n            Return String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, \"{0}.Unity.config\", System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName.Name)\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Function GetDataAccess(Of T As IDataAccess)() As T\n        Return UnityContainer.Resolve(Of T)()\n    End Function\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nThe DataAccessFactory provides the data needed by the UnityFactoryBase(Of DataAccessFactory) as well as the method that I need to retrieve an IDataAccess class. I will show you how it is called, but first there is the little matter of config:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<configuration>\n  <configSections>\n    <section name=\"unity\" type=\"Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration.UnityConfigurationSection, Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration\" />\n  </configSections>\n  <unity>\n    <typeAliases>\n      <!-- Lifetime manager types should be inserted if you need lifetime managers -->\n      <typeAlias alias=\"singleton\" type=\"Microsoft.Practices.Unity.ContainerControlledLifetimeManager, Microsoft.Practices.Unity\" />\n      <typeAlias alias=\"external\" type=\"Microsoft.Practices.Unity.ExternallyControlledLifetimeManager, Microsoft.Practices.Unity\" />\n      <!-- User defined type aliases -->\n      <!-- An interface for artifact data access implementation -->\n      <typeAlias alias=\"IArtifactDataAccess`1\" type=\"Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common.IArtifactDataAccess`1, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common\" />\n    </typeAliases>\n    <containers>\n      <container name=\"DataAccess\">\n        <types>\n          <!-- Lifetime managers specified using the type aliases -->\n          <type type=\"IArtifactDataAccess`1\" mapTo=\"Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml.ArtifactDataAccess`1, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml\">\n            <lifetime type=\"singleton\" />\n          </type>\n        </types>\n      </container>\n    </containers>\n  </unity>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nI am not going to explain the config file as it is well (ish) documented, but it effectively mapped all generic calls to retrieve IArtifactDataAccess\\`1 to the implementation in the XML assembly of ArtifactDataAccess\\`1 and makes the resultant object a singleton.\n\nTo call this lovely package after you have populated it with many many DataAccess goodies all you need to do is this:\n\n```\nDim dal As IArtifactDataAccess(Of DynamicPolicy) = DataAccessFactory.Instance.GetDataAccess(Of IArtifactDataAccess(Of DynamicPolicy))()\n```\n\nLovely and simple, and to add a new implementation all I need is an Interface like IArtifactDataAccess.. lets call it IHypotheticalDataBits, a concrete implementation… lets call it HypoDataFromTwitter and a mapping in the config file:\n\n```\n<type type=\"IHypotheticalDataBits\" mapTo=\"Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml.HypoDataFromTwitter, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml\">\n  <lifetime type=\"singleton\" />\n</type>\n```\n\nAnd you can then call:\n\n```\nDim dal As IHypotheticalDataBits = DataAccessFactory.Instance.GetDataAccess(Of IHypotheticalDataBits)()\n```\n\nAny easier and it would be writing for you :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Developing](http://technorati.com/tags/Developing) [Version Control](http://technorati.com/tags/Version+Control) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject)\n",

I understand the limitations, but having to have a specific policy installed on every developers computer before you can use it is slightly ridicules and practically unmanageable. Why is there not a way to have a single installation that allows you to select any policy you want and have it execute in the desired manor on every client, including web clients?\n{ .post-img }\n\nI think it is. With the advent of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) it should be possible to have a single (well one for each version of Visual Studio) policy that allows you to pick a DLR policy and have it run. One better would be to have a site that encapsulated those policies and you could just pick the one you want from a list. This could then open up a bunch of other features, like saved policy sets or composite policies for specific methodologies, or many others. But keeping to the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principal all I need are two or three things, a Web Service based data store, a Policy and an editor.\n\nI am currently working on the Web Services and how to pass and store the data I will need, but it looks promising and my initial investigations certainly worked quite well even though I am hampered by my lack of IronPython or IronRuby experience.\n\n[![ar123456585516148](images/Aperfictmatch_701B-ar123456585516148_thumb-1-1.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Aperfictmatch_701B-ar123456585516148_2.jpg)Once I have the web services up to scratch (WCF by the way) I will try my hand at the Editor (WPF) and then move onto the Web interface (ASP.NET MVC) all in Visual Studio 2010.  A mammoth task, but one I think I can manage… famous last words…\n{ .post-img }\n\nI might need to learn a little Ruby :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [Developing](http://technorati.com/tags/Developing) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [Version Control](http://technorati.com/tags/Version+Control) [WCF](http://technorati.com/tags/WCF) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [VS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2010)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I am not sure if this is a good idea, but I was bored one day and decided to add a TFS Error Log provider for [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/). There are 2 ways you can do this. You can create a new WorkItem type and log an error report for each of the errors or you can create one work item for each error type/title. To do this you can create a title that is the combination of error message and application name and then search TFS for an existing work item. If it exists then add the error to it, if it does not then create a work item for that instance. You can use any work item type, and the errors are added as [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) xml log files.\n\nThere are a number of things you need to override when you inherit from [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/).ErrorLog. The first is the Log method.\n\n```\n''' <summary>\n''' Logs the error as an attachment to an existing work item, or adds a new work item if this error has not occurred.\n''' </summary>\n''' <param name=\"error\">The error to be logged</param>\n''' <returns>The ID of the error</returns>\n''' <remarks></remarks>\nPublic Overrides Function Log(ByVal [error] As [Error]) As String\n    Dim errorId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()\n    Dim timeStamp = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(\"yyyy-MM-ddHHmmssZ\", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)\n    Dim Filename = String.Format(\"error-{0}-{1}.elmah\", timeStamp, errorId)\n    Dim temp = System.IO.Path.Combine(\".\", Filename)\n    ' Temp Log to disk\n    Using writer = New XmlTextWriter(temp, Encoding.UTF8)\n        writer.Formatting = Formatting.Indented\n        writer.WriteStartElement(\"error\")\n        writer.WriteAttributeString(\"errorId\", errorId)\n        ErrorXml.Encode([error], writer)\n        writer.WriteEndElement()\n        writer.Flush()\n    End Using\n\n    Dim Title As String = String.Format(\"{0}-{1}\", [error].ApplicationName, [error].Message)\n\n    Dim wi As WorkItem = GetWorkItemForException(Title, [error])\n\n    Dim a As New Attachment(temp, \"Elmah error log\")\n\n    wi.Attachments.Add(a)\n    If wi.IsValid Then\n        wi.Save()\n        Return String.Format(\"{0}|{1}\", wi.Id, errorId.ToString)\n    Else\n        Dim message As New System.Text.StringBuilder\n        Dim results = wi.Validate()\n        Dim isFirst As Boolean = True\n        For Each r In results\n            message.AppendLine(String.Format(IIf(isFirst, \"{0}\", \", {0}\"), r))\n            isFirst = False\n        Next\n        Throw New ApplicationException(String.Format(\"Unable to save the work item because the following fields produced a validation error '{0}'.\", message.ToString))\n    End If\nEnd Function\n```\n\nThe idea is that you attach the [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) log file to the work item with a .[elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) extension. This will allow us to find all the error logs in the future. So we create the temporary log file, and then create our key/title for our work item. You can customize this by customizing your exception messages on the server side. We then get our work item, and add the file as an attachment.\n\nBecause I am doing this the quick and dirty way, i.e. just for fun, I have utilised the API’s provided in the Templates add-on for the Power Tools to customize the work items. So when we are creating the Work item:\n\n```\nProtected Function GetWorkItemForException(ByVal Title As String, ByVal [error] As [Error]) As WorkItem\n    Dim wi As WorkItem = GetExistingWorkItem(Title)\n    If wi Is Nothing Then\n        wi = CreateNewWorkItem(Title)\n    End If\n    m_TemplateDefault.Fields.ApplyFieldValues(wi, False)\n    ApplyErrorFieldValues(wi, [error])\n    Return wi\nEnd Function\n```\n\nSo, we either get an existing work item, or we create a new one, but then we need to apply some values to the work item. In the constructor of the class [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) passes an IDictionary object that we use to pass the template names.\n\n```\nPublic Sub New(ByVal config As IDictionary)\n    If config Is Nothing Then\n        Throw New ArgumentNullException(\"config\")\n    End If\n    sm_Config = config\n\n    Dim store As ITemplateStore = GetStore()\n    m_TemplateDefault = GetTemplate(\"Defaults\", store)\n    m_TemplateErrorMap = GetTemplate(\"ErrorMap\", store)\n\n    If m_TemplateDefault Is Nothing Or m_TemplateErrorMap Is Nothing Then\n        Throw New ApplicationException(\"Unable to load the templates from the store.\")\n    End If\n\nEnd Sub\n```\n\nI created a Store (Microsoft.TeamFoundation.PowerTools.Client.WorkItemTracking.Templates.ITemplateStore) for the templates and attempt to load both a “defaults” template and a dynamic “mapping” template. The latter will need some special mapping, but as you can see from the GetWorkItemForException there is already a method on the Template object to Apply all of the values to a work item. Here is an example default template:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Template xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">\n  <FieldValues>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>System.AreaPath</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>TestProject1TestArea1</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>System.IterationPath</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>TestProject1TestIteration1</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>System.AssignedTo</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>Martin Hinshelwood</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>Microsoft.VSTS.CMMI.FoundInEnvironment</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>DEV</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>Build_v1.13_20090312.1</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n  </FieldValues>\n  <WorkItemTypeName>Bug</WorkItemTypeName>\n  <TeamServerUri>http://tfs01.company.biz:8080/</TeamServerUri>\n  <TeamProjectName>TestProject1</TeamProjectName>\n  <Description />\n</Template>\n```\n\nThese values are now mapped onto the work item. But what about any dynamic values that we want to use from the Error. I added a second template called “ErrorMap” that will use the same format, but use something like:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Template xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">\n  <FieldValues>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>System.AreaPath</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>TestProject1{ApplicationName}</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>System.Description</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>{WebHostHtmlMessage}</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n    <FieldValue>\n      <ReferenceName>Company.Custom.MethodName</ReferenceName>\n      <Value>{Exception.TargetSite.Name}</Value>\n    </FieldValue>\n  </FieldValues>\n  <WorkItemTypeName>Bug</WorkItemTypeName>\n  <TeamServerUri>http://tfs01.company.biz:8080/</TeamServerUri>\n  <TeamProjectName>TestProject1</TeamProjectName>\n  <Description />\n</Template>\n```\n\nWe can then apply those values with a little reflection by parsing out the value and applying the retrieved object values to the work item.\n\n```\nPrivate Sub ApplyErrorFieldValues(ByVal wi As WorkItem, ByVal [error] As [Error])\n    For Each i In m_TemplateErrorMap.Fields\n        Dim value As String = GetPropertyValue(i.Value, [error])\n        If wi.Fields(i.ReferenceName).AllowedValues.Contains(value) Then\n            wi.Fields(i.ReferenceName).Value = value\n        Else\n            Throw New ApplicationException(String.Format(\"Unable to set the work item field '{0}' to '{1}' as '{1}' is not in the Allowed Values list.\", i.ReferenceName, value))\n        End If\n    Next\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Function GetPropertyValue(ByVal path As String, ByVal target As Object) As String\n    Dim bits() As String = path.Split(\".\")\n    Dim ll As New LinkedList(Of String)\n    Array.ForEach(bits, Function(b) ll.AddLast(b))\n    Return GetPropertyRecurse(ll.First, target)\nEnd Function\n\nPrivate Function GetPropertyRecurse(ByVal node As LinkedListNode(Of String), ByVal target As Object) As String\n    ' ToDo: add ability to support propertyName(0) [arrays]\n    Dim r As System.Reflection.PropertyInfo = target.GetType.GetProperty(node.Value, BindingFlags.Static Or BindingFlags.Public Or BindingFlags.GetField Or BindingFlags.GetProperty)\n    If r.PropertyType.IsClass And Not node.Next Is Nothing Then\n        Return GetPropertyRecurse(node.Next, r.GetValue(target, Nothing))\n    Else\n        Return r.GetValue(target, Nothing).ToString\n    End If\nEnd Function\n```\n\nLike I said this is work in progress and it does not support arrays as sub values, but it does add a certain level of versatility to the logging. My last project used a logging system, not [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/), to log errors to TFS in this way and I also added functionality to update the work item in different ways if it was Closed or Resolved to reactivate it depending on the Build number values.\n\nWe have now created a new work item, but what about loading an existing one?\n\n```\nPrivate Function GetExistingWorkItem(ByVal Title As String) As WorkItem\n    ' Query for work items\n    Dim query As String = \"SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] \" _\n                         & \"FROM WorkItems \" _\n                         & \"WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @Project  \" _\n                         & \"AND  [System.WorkItemType] = @WorkItemType  \" _\n                         & \"AND  [System.Title] = @Title  \" _\n                         & \"ORDER BY [System.Id]\"\n    Dim paramiters As New Hashtable\n    paramiters.Add(\"Project\", m_TemplateDefault.TeamProjectName)\n    paramiters.Add(\"WorkItemType\", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)\n    paramiters.Add(\"Title\", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)\n    Dim y As WorkItemCollection = TfsWorkItemStore.Query(query, paramiters)\n    Return y(0)\nEnd Function\n```\n\nThis is a simple search for the title that we created and pass back the first match, just in case we have duplicates.\n\nAnd that's all there is to saving your logs into VSTS, but how do we get them out! This is pretty easy as all of our log entries have now been saved to a TFS work item and if you remember from before we used the “String.Format(\"{0}|{1}\", wi.Id, errorId.ToString)“ for the ID so we can find the work item again.\n\nThe two thing we have left is loading a single error, and loading all of the errors. Getting a single error is a little tricky, which is why we passed back the ID in a format that included the Work Item ID.\n\n```\nPublic Overrides Function GetError(ByVal id As String) As ErrorLogEntry\n    Dim idBits() As String = id.Split(\"|\")\n    Dim wiId As Integer\n    Dim errGuid As String\n    If Not idBits.Length = 2 Then\n        Throw New ArgumentException(\"Invalid ID, it must be made in the format {workItemId}|{guid}\", \"id\")\n    End If\n    If Not IsNumeric(idBits(0)) Then\n        Throw New ArgumentException(\"The workItemId part of the ID must be an integer. Format: {workItemId}|{guid}\", \"id\")\n    End If\n    wiId = CInt(idBits(0))\n    Try\n        errGuid = New Guid(idBits(1)).ToString\n    Catch ex As Exception\n        Throw New ArgumentException(\"The guid part of the ID must be an integer. Format: {workItemId}|{guid}\", \"id\")\n    End Try\n    Dim wi As WorkItem = TfsWorkItemStore.GetWorkItem(wiId)\n    If wi Is Nothing Then\n        Throw New ApplicationException(\"A work item with that id does not exits\")\n    End If\n    Dim a = (From attachemnt As Attachment In wi.Attachments Where attachemnt.Name.Contains(errGuid) Select attachemnt).SingleOrDefault\n    If a Is Nothing Then\n        Throw New ApplicationException(\"The attachment does not exits or has been removed\")\n    End If\n    Return GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(wi, a)\nEnd Function\n```\n\nIn this method we do a little validation while parsing out the Work Item ID and the [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) ID, we then load the specified work item, and find the attachment, and return it. I have a little helper method to make a log item from an attachment, but it fairly simple:\n\n```\nPrivate Function GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(ByVal wi As WorkItem, ByVal a As Attachment) As ErrorLogEntry\n    Using reader = XmlReader.Create(a.Uri.ToString)\n        If Not reader.IsStartElement(\"error\") Then\n            Return Nothing\n        End If\n        Dim errid = String.Format(\"{0}|{1}\", wi.Id, reader.GetAttribute(\"errorId\"))\n        Dim [error] = ErrorXml.Decode(reader)\n        Return New ErrorLogEntry(Me, errid, [error])\n    End Using\n    Return Nothing\nEnd Function\n```\n\nAnd voila! You havve a single Error Log Entry. As you have probably guesses, getting all the errors is easy now. We just need to find all attachements that have a .[elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) extension in our project. A little linq can help with this.\n\n```\nPublic Overrides Function GetErrors(ByVal pageIndex As Integer, ByVal pageSize As Integer, ByVal errorEntryList As System.Collections.IList) As Integer\n    If pageIndex < 0 Then Throw New ArgumentOutOfRangeException(\"pageIndex\", pageIndex, Nothing)\n    If pageSize < 0 Then Throw New ArgumentOutOfRangeException(\"pageSize\", pageSize, Nothing)\n\n    ' Query for work items\n    Dim query As String = \"SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] \" _\n                         & \"FROM WorkItems \" _\n                         & \"WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @Project  \" _\n                         & \"AND  [System.WorkItemType] = @WorkItemType  \" _\n                         & \"ORDER BY [System.Id]\"\n    Dim paramiters As New Hashtable\n    paramiters.Add(\"Project\", m_TemplateDefault.TeamProjectName)\n    paramiters.Add(\"WorkItemType\", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)\n    Dim y As WorkItemCollection = TfsWorkItemStore.Query(query, paramiters)\n    ' Query work items for attachments\n    Dim wiats = From wi As WorkItem In y, a As Attachment In wi.Attachments Where a.Name.Contains(\".elmah\") Order By a.Name Select a, wi\n    If Not wiats Is Nothing Then\n        ' Select specific attachemnts\n        Dim results = From wiat In wiats Skip pageIndex * pageSize Take pageSize Select wiat\n        ' Add to output\n        For Each el In results\n            errorEntryList.Add(GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(el.wi, el.a))\n        Next\n    End If\n    ' return count\n    Return errorEntryList.Count\nEnd Function\n```\n\nAnd there we go, errors from [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) saved into Team Foundation Server and then loaded back out. I don’t know how useful this would be in the real world, but it was good for a little boredom relief.\n\n**Full Source**\n\n```\nImports Elmah\nImports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client\nImports

If I am asked to do this again I would create a proper command line utility, or even a WPF interface to display the data prettily.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [TFBS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFBS) [Version Control](http://technorati.com/tags/Version+Control) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

The problem I have is that if you have a DropDownList on the same page as a update panel that updates based on a timer, you get a little interference.\n\nIf the user has the DropDownList open when the update occurs then the DropDownList closes. Very annoying.\n\nThe standard FindControl does not work as it requires an ID, so what if all you have is a type?\n\nWell, you need a little extension method :)\n\n```\nImports System.Runtime.CompilerServices\nImports System.Web\nImports System.Web.UI\n\nModule WebExtensions\n\n    <Extension()> _\n    Friend Sub FindControls(Of T)(ByVal control As Control, ByVal list As List(Of T))\n        If control.HasControls Then\n            Dim timers = control.Controls.OfType(Of T)()\n            list.AddRange(timers)\n            Dim subcontrols = From c In control.Controls Where Not timers.Cast(Of Control).Contains(c)\n            For Each c In subcontrols.Cast(Of Control)()\n                c.FindControls(Of T)(list)\n            Next\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\n    <Extension()> _\n    Friend Function FindControls(Of T)(ByVal control As Control) As List(Of T)\n        Dim l As New List(Of T)\n        control.FindControls(Of T)(l)\n        Return l\n    End Function\n\nEnd Module\n```\n\nI am pretty sure this is not the most efficient of code, and any recommendation on improving it are welcome…\n\nOnce this is in place it is easily called and actioned upon:\n\n```\nSub OnPagePreRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)\n\n    ' Fix for pages with drop down lists\n    FixForDropdownListsAndTimers()\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub FixForDropdownListsAndTimers()\n    ' Provcess timers\n    Me.FindControls(Of System.Web.UI.Timer).ForEach(New Action(Of System.Web.UI.Timer)(AddressOf ProcessTimers))\nEnd Sub\n\nPrivate Sub ProcessTimers(ByVal t As System.Web.UI.Timer)\n    t.Enabled = Not DisableTimers\nEnd Sub\n```\n\nDisableTimers is set at the page level and filters down to the control so we can now disable all timers on a page when we want.\n\nThe FindControls method can find a list of all instances of a control type from an entire page, regardless of the nesting…\n\nUPDATE: OK, so you have probably guessed that I am a complete **_muppet_**.. I have changes my UpdatePanels to UpdateMode=“Conditional” and with a few extra lines of code solved my problem the correct way! I will be keeping this little bit of code as you never know when you need to find all instances of a type of control :)… I am such a donkey…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject)\n",

Mainly for Outlook, and why I need to uninstall Expression Studio Web I do not know, it may be due to some integration for creating html emails…\n\nThis will be a 64 bit adoption blocker for companies as this will be difficult to automate…\n\nI think with the prevalence of 64bit hardware, the release of Windows 7, and the RAM now coming as standard in new computers getting above 3.5GB there will be a lot more 64 bit upgrades and this needs to be looked at… I don’t know if it is possible, but can’t the install just uninstall my previous versions?

Aaron sent the first message and both Brian and Neno replied. It shows Brian and Aaron’s email  on the same line because Brian’s email is the most recent in the conversation. But Neno also replied and thus it is a split conversation. Think of it like a wee tree with Aaron’s email having 2 branches with Brian’s email being the latest. If you leave it rolled up you never see Aaron’s email, just the latest with the trail in it. This both minimizes the number of emails you have to read, and groups them together so you can follow the conversation.\n\n[![image](images/FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you open it out, it shows all three emails, with the replies with the little dots.\n\nHere is an example when all of the replies come in order.\n\n[![image](images/FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd expanded\n\n[![image](images/FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nLike I said… Nice…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Office](http://technorati.com/tags/Office)\n",

If you are just opening VS2005/VS2003 occasionally then you could probably get away with using 2010 to control TFS and working in 2005, but many BI developers are still spending a considerable amount of there time in 2005 :(\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2010) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

    "BodyContent": "You may think, why is he uninstalling VS2010? Well, apart from proving that it works…And that it plays well with VS2008 I need to remove the pre-beta beta that I have installed.\n\n[![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis is in fact the second time I have uninstalled VS2010 on this computer, and I had no problems last time, but the difference is that I will be installing a slightly different build :) of Beta 1.\n\nI am hoping that I do not have any problems, but my scenario is largely unsupported.\n\nI have removed visual studio, but it probably left a few trainer that I will need to remove manually. The easiest way is to see what was installed in the last month and check it all… Gruelling I know, but what can you do…\n\nThere is a nice little feature in Vista when you are in the programs list that lets you filter the list… coz it can be realy big\n\n[![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_1-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nHere is he list of software I have installed in the last month:\n\n[![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_2-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have highlighted all of the 2010 bits and it at first seams like there are rather a lot of them, but as you go through the list (I will finish with the .NET 4.0 bits) you find that it is just a cleanup issue..\n\n[![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_3-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nSo I then had some fun uninstalling .NET 4.0…\n\nI know that this was unsupported, and that we were warned us not to do it, but we are developers and we like to push the big red buttons, but I installed the pre-beta beta on my production computer…\n\nDuring the uninstall there was an infinite number of runtime errors.\n\n[![clip_image002](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image002_thumb-2-2.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image002_2.jpg)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd after cancelling and rebooting received lots of .net 4.0 errors for all sorts of applications upon boot.\n\n[![clip_image004](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image004_thumb-3-3.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image004_2.jpg)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe same thing happened during my second attempt at uninstalling. The plan now is to try a repair and then an uninstall...\n\nWell, the repair failed, so I am going strait to installing from the new .NET 4.0 Beta 1 release and everything seams to be working ok so far. I realise that my computer will be in an unknown state afterwards, but I can always reinstall when I get the chance.\n\n[![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_4-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_10.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd after a restart, no problems… Wohooo….\n\nNow to VS2010… And if my infrastructure team get me my VPC there will be [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") fun as Well.\n\nSo the end result is that although I have not uninstalled .NET 4.0, I do have the latest version which is what I wanted…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [VS 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2010) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008)\n",

The workaround was to connect in offline and then click the connect button and everything invariable works with no additional problems.\n\nWith Visual Studio 2010 the mater is slightly different. It pops up with a vague error that I had not seen before, but a little searching seamed to indicate that it may be the proxy problem rearing its ugly head in a killer way.\n\n[![SavingToCodeplexOverHttpsThroughISA](images/image-1.png)](images/image-1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nSo the “ServicePointManager does not support proxies with the https scheme” error has been seen before when connecting to [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") services through a proxies.

Now in your ASP.NET page just like in your WPF application you need a little extra bit to get it all going. Finding this for WPF is easy, not so much in ASP.\n\n```\nImports System.Web\nImports System.Web.UI\nImports Microsoft.Practices.Unity\n''' <summary>\n''' C# version and source\n''' http://blogs.msdn.com/mpuleio/archive/2008/07/17/proof-of-concept-a-simple-di-solution-for-asp-net-webforms.aspx\n''' </summary>\n''' <remarks></remarks>\nPublic Class UnityHttpModule\n    Implements IHttpModule\n\n    Public Sub Dispose() Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Dispose\n\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Sub Init(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpApplication) Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Init\n        AddHandler context.PreRequestHandlerExecute, AddressOf OnPreRequestHandlerExecute\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Sub OnPreRequestHandlerExecute(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)\n        Dim handler As IHttpHandler = HttpContext.Current.Handler\n        If TypeOf handler Is Page Then\n            My.Unity.Container.BuildUp(handler.GetType(), handler)\n\n            ' User Controls are ready to be built up after the page initialization is complete\n            Dim page As Page = handler\n            If Not page Is Nothing Then\n                AddHandler page.InitComplete, AddressOf OnPageInitComplete\n            End If\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Sub OnPageInitComplete(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)\n        Dim page As Web.UI.Page = sender\n        For Each c In BuildControlTree(page)\n            Try\n                My.Unity.Container.BuildUp(c.GetType(), c)\n            Catch ex As Exception\n                ' TODO: Some sort of error handling if important\n                WebPortalTrace.Verbose(WebPortalTraceType.Unity, \"Unity unable to build up {0}\", c.GetType)\n            End Try\n        Next\n    End Sub\n\n    ' Get the controls in the page's control tree excluding the page itself\n    Private Function BuildControlTree(ByVal root As Control) As List(Of Control)\n        Dim ct As New List(Of Control)\n        For Each c In root.Controls\n            ct.Add(c)\n            ct.AddRange(BuildControlTree(c))\n        Next\n        Return ct\n    End Function\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nAll you need is to put a reference into your config file:\n\n```\n  <system.web>\n    <httpModules>\n      <add name=\"UnityHttpModule\" type=\"Company.Product.UnityHttpModule, Company.Product\"/>\n    </httpModules>\n  </system.web>\n```\n\nAnd off you go, before you know it you will have dependency injection coming out of your ears.\n\nOne of the advantages to using dependency injection is that you could change a piece of functionality without having to recompile and redeploy your site! How about this…\n\n```\n<unity>\n    <containers>\n      <container>\n        <types>\n          <type type=\"Company.Product.ViewModels.IRecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product\" mapTo=\"Company.Product.ViewModels.RecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product\" />\n        </types>\n      </container>\n    </containers>\n</unity>\n```\n\nThe business then decide that they have to have the order of the recent items list changed but that it needs to go into production immediately, so your testing cycle is extremely tight. No problem… fire up a new solution and create a new class that inherits from IRecentItemsViewModel and implement the new functionality. Then compile it as “Company.Product.Hotfix1”, drop it into your test site bin folder and change line above to:\n\n```\n<unity>\n    <containers>\n      <container>\n        <types>\n          <type type=\"Company.Product.ViewModels.IRecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product\" mapTo=\"Company.Product.Hotfix1.ViewModels.RecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product.Hotfix1\" />\n        </types>\n      </container>\n    </containers>\n</unity>\n```\n\nThe site will then load your new code and you can test the only functionality that you have changed, before deploying to production. Now this may not seam like much, but if your system is made up of thousands of views then you may just need this functionality. And it is so easy to achieve that even for small projects it is fantastic.\n\nP.S. Works with MVC… shhhh…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Software Development](http://technorati.com/tags/Software+Development) [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have been attempting to integrate the Unity Application Block into my website to allow me to share the same base object code between a WPF and an ASP.NET application. I will let you know how I am getting along later as I am still knee deep in refactoring, but I have found something a little useful.\n\nI have created a custom “My” object in Visual Studio. This means that I can do “My.Unity.Container” to retrieve my UnityContainer object form anywhere is my code. I know it my be trivial to achieve in other ways, but I am a VB degenerate having fun, so leave me alone…\n\nThe first thing we need is a way of consistently creating a singleton instance of our UnityContainer across all of our code in the AppDomain.\n\n```\nImports Microsoft.Practices.Unity\n\nPublic Class UnityContainer\n    Inherits Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer\n\n    Private Shared sm_UnityContainer As Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer\n    Private Shared sm_syncRoot As New Object\n\n    Private Sub New()\n        MyBase.New()\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Shared ReadOnly Property Current() As Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer\n        Get\n            If (sm_UnityContainer Is Nothing) Then\n                SyncLock sm_syncRoot\n                    If (sm_UnityContainer Is Nothing) Then\n                        sm_UnityContainer = New UnityContainer\n                        'Dim section As UnityConfigurationSection = ConfigurationManager.GetSection(\"unity\")\n                        'section.Containers.Default.Configure(sm_UnityContainer)\n                    End If\n                End SyncLock\n            End If\n            Return sm_UnityContainer\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nI have commented the lines out, but you could also initialise the Unity Container from a config file, but remember that it will be the top level config of your application root an not the config from the Assembly that you code happens to be in.\n\nWe could just leave it at that, and If you use C# this is about your lot, but in VB you have the “My” namespace that gives you access to some useful things all in one place.\n\n[![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_2-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIn order to achieve this you need to create a Module in the “My” namespace that has a single property that access the previous class.\n\n```\nImports Common\n\nNamespace My\n\n  <HideModuleName()> _\n  Module MyUnityExtensions\n\n        Friend ReadOnly Property Unity() As UnityContainer\n            Get\n                Return UnityContainer.Current\n            End Get\n        End Property\n\n    End Module\n\nEnd Namespace\n```\n\nThis the allows you to access the UnityContainer object in the same way that you would access My.User.\n\n[![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_3-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nInside the Unity object you will have all of the shared properties and methods that we created earlier.\n\n[![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_5-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_12.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nTo examine the use of this I have followed [O1eg Smirnov](http://www.codeproject.com/Members/O1eg-Smirnov)’s [Ninja Dependency Injection](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/UnityApplicationBlockNDI.aspx) scenario.\n\nSo, I have a Console application that registers a sword type and the resolves out a Ninja Object using Unity.\n\n```\nImports NinjaCommon\n\nModule Module1\n\n    Sub Main()\n\n        ' Register Weapon\n        My.Unity.RegisterType(Of IWeapon, Sword)()\n        'Create Ninja\n        Dim ninja = My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)()\n        ' Ninja uses weapon\n        ninja.Weapon.use()\n        ' Create Battle\n        Dim battle As New NinjaClasses.Battle\n        ' Start the fight\n        battle.StartFight()\n\n        Console.ReadKey()\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Module\n```\n\nBut it then instantiates a Battle class from the NinjaClasses assembly which uses it own My.Unity class to access the same UnityContainer object.\n\n```\nPublic Class Battle\n\n    Public Sub New()\n\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Sub StartFight()\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Fight Starting \")\n        ' Create 10 ninjas and get them to use their weapon.\n        For count = 1 To 10\n            Dim ninja = My.Unity.Resolve(Of NinjaCommon.Ninja)()\n            ninja.Weapon.use()\n        Next\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Fight ended\")\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nAlthough this example in no way demonstrates the power of the Unity Application Block, and is a bit silly, I think it demonstartes the use of the “My” namespace.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Software Development](http://technorati.com/tags/Software+Development) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

    "BodyContent": "The [Developer Developer Developer](http://developerdayscotland.com) event held at [Glasgow Caledonian University](http://www.gcal.ac.uk/) (my University) yesterday was excellent. Kudos to [Colin Angus Mackay](http://blog.colinmackay.net/) and the other organisers for all of the effort they have put in once again.\n\n**Everything you wanted to know about refactoring but were afraid to ask!**\n\nI attended [Gary Short](http://www.garyshort.org)'s session on refactoring and found pretty much everything he had to say had merit. This session was more about the mechanics of refactoring than the theory, but the theory he did cover was very useful. I especially liked is analogy about code debt. Those things that you just do quickly or in a less than optimal way incur a kind of code debt that you have to pay back at some point otherwise your software will be to waited down to maintain properly.\n\nI only wish that some of my companies developers and especially the IT management had attended. I for one will be taking away that refactoring necessary to part of your iterations. Having a full iteration for refactoring every few iterations may seam like a lot, but it allows you to pay back that debt in manageable chunks.\n\n**Embracing a new world - Dynamic languages and .NET**\n\n[Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/)'s session on dynamic languages was very interesting even though he did get heckled by Gary after having a dig about Gary's “[IronSmalltalk](http://garyshortblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/microblogging-for-march-10-2009/)” project...\n\nBen talked about IronRuby and IronPython, both built by Microsoft on top of the new DLR ([Dynamic Language Runtime](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr)) that allows dynamic languages to be built on top of .NET easily. I for one, being a philistine and liking my comfort zone would like to see IronBasic making an appearance. This is not just for my own benefit, but Ben presented a scenario where you would get a user to enter some code into a textbox and have it executed to provide a grater level of customization to your users without them having to compile an assembly. I feel a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") Check in Policy coming on :) ) This I feel would benefit from a VB style language that business users, familiar with VB for Office Applications and the macros, could more easily interact with. For example a Check in Policy could allow a project manager to create a custom policy on the fly and have it apply across their project without having to compile an assembly and have it distributed to all of the developer computers...\n\n**Make Patterns With Patterns - Introducing the MVVM design pattern for WPF**\n\nThe main event for me was **[Ray Booysen](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/)**’s session on [MVVM](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/archive/tags/MVVM/default.aspx). I found his delivery excellent and although there was at least one guy that did not get it, this is the pattern that I have been looking for with WPF. I had been looking at Prism, but this is an MVC WPF implementation and I much prefer the MVVM style, although I think that the Prism framework will support MVVM and it brings dependency injection along with some other mice bits . Ray was compelling and informative and his enthusiasm for this topic pulled most of us in immediately. But, before I can fully commit to MVVM I will need to give it a go, and I have a few ideas…\n\n[Get the slides](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/archive/2009/05/02/demo-code-and-slides-from-ddd-scotland.aspx)\n\n**Grok Talks**\n\nI missed most of the talks, but I got back just in time to see a session about XmlSerilizer verses XamlSerilizer and the sped benefits of using the XamlSerilizer. This was interesting as I had run into some of the same problems myself and opted for the third way which is the WcfSerilizer which provides the benefit over the XamlSerilizer that it can sterilize generic types and over the XmlSerilizer that it can sterilize IDictionary objects as well.\n\n**When good architecture goes bad**\n\nTaking a different approach than Gary's session on code debt [Mark Dalgarno](http://blog.software-acumen.com/) went further and provided an interactive session on architectural atrophy that showed why a long running product can suffer for a kind of Architectural degradation if the architectural team is not strong enough to make sure that the developers do not deviate from the architecture over time. If the developers have an architectural change that is necessary then it should be presented to the architects who take this on board and modify the overall architecture allowing the change to be incorporated more fully into the overall solution. Again a session that my management and team leads should attend. Especially when either of the scenarios used could have applied to them. In fact the whole talk could have been based on my company.\n\n**ASP.NET 4.0**\n\nAlthough I was in the room, I could not say that I attended this session as I was suffering from a late night and an early rise, and by the time this session started I was starting to drift off. Sorry [Mike](http://mikeo.co.uk/), it was not you, it was me...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [Software Development](http://technorati.com/tags/Software+Development) [Windows](http://technorati.com/tags/Windows) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [MVVM](http://technorati.com/tags/MVVM)\n",

It is pretty heavy on code with endless pages of it, but even if you take them out, there is some good content in there. If you have figured out how to deploy Silverlight to Sharepoint then I can’t promise you will learn anything, but if this is your first outing, I think you will find some useful ideas and methods.\n\nThe book takes you through all of the essentials, creating Custom Field types, Branding and custom web parts with Silverlight along with data interaction to produce a slick little training site. There are even some bits on deploying solutions and debugging against Sharepoint.

    "BodyContent": "If you are in any way involved in or thinking bout Testing code, Websites or Web Services then you should have a look at the [VSTT Quick Reference Guide 1.0](http://vstt2008qrg.codeplex.com/) which the [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\") Rangers team has published on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\").\n\nIf only this had been published weeks ago when I was delving into the world of web and load test I would have had a much easier time as most of the problems that I encountered have solutions offered right here in this document.\n\nHere is a summary of the document from the horses mouth:\n\n> **Summary**\n>\n> This document is a collection of items from public blog sites, Microsoft® internal discussion aliases\n>\n> (sanitized) and experiences from various Test Consultants in the Microsoft Services Labs. The idea is to\n>\n> provide quick reference points around various aspects of Microsoft Visual Studio® Team Test edition\n>\n> that may not be covered in core documentation, or may not be easily understood. The different types of\n>\n> information cover:\n>\n> · How does this feature work under the covers?\n>\n> · How can I implement a workaround for this missing feature?\n>\n> · This is a known bug and here is a fix or workaround.\n>\n> · How do I troubleshoot issues I am having?\n>\n> This Ranger solution is the result of an on-going multi-year cooperation with Microsoft Services Labs. Some of you might still remember the exciting news after over one year of cooperation with members of Services Labs which resulted in booting our competitor off our campus. Our message was, “yes we admit that we don’t have feature parity with the market leader in testing but we have a flexible framework and can extend and customize to fill the gaps”. In a team effort with Services Labs, we managed to beat Mercury in one of the largest Services engagements (Motorola/911 public project).\n>\n> Services Labs is a professional testing center and until that point, they had specialized in delivering enterprise level professional testing services but their primary tooling was not VSTT. After switching to our products, they had the challenge of mapping their testing knowledge to VSTT which was not as mature as the competitors products. Their test engineers and test consultants had to figure out how to tweak our tools  and find workarounds to do the same testing procedures. The result is a concentrated reference book with 80 pages of no-nonsense prescriptive guide.\n\nAs you can see this document is not a theoretical document, but a real world problems, real world solutions kinda thing that  has been created with a lot of hard work and customer interaction…\n\nWell done Rangers…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [Testing](http://technorati.com/tags/Testing) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

This an excellent book and I only wish that all tech books used some of the principals of learning that are contained in it. As [Jeff Attwood](http://www.codinghorror.com) has [noted](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000380.html) there are some problems with the content of this book, but the thing that I love is it’s, and all the other books in the [Head First](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) series ability to interact with your brain in a more effective manor.\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you are dyslexic or indeed have any sort of learning difficulty caused by the way information is imparted in our society then you will love this book. Even if you don't then the same disability principals apply… If is easier for people with particular problems to use then that makes it easier for everyone.\n\nThe idea is that the way your brain LIKES to assimilate information is not conducive to a lot of reading. Have you ever read a whole chapter of a tech book, and then thought to yourself, “What was that chapter about?”. This is because, unless your brain is stimulated it will usually disregard the information as irrelevant.\n\nThe [Head First](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) series uses pictures and concepts to encourages your brain to produce chemicals in order to trick it into remembering more of the information.\n\nI would recommend this book to any budding and exiting author of technical books…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia)\n",

All that work in CSS and none of your images work when you run it in a different location. This would be especially frustrating when you are running multiple feature branches and need Kerberos interaction. The amount of work required to get Kerberos to work (SPN’s, URL’s, Delegation and AD) limits the number of sites you can have in an enterprise environment.\n\nI have just two. I have a site for the latest candidate release and one to host all of my feature branches. As I am using TFS I identify my Feature with either a Requirement or Change Request Id and name everything after this.\n\nThus I have [http://site/](http://site/) and [http://site-dev/1345](http://site-dev/1345). This makes it easy to find and test, and my CI build at the ends of the day just overwrites the previous version.\n\nThis means that all of your css like this…\n\n```\n.down {\n   padding-right:14px;\n   background: url('/UI/Resources/Images/arrow_down.gif') no-repeat 100% 50%;\n}\n```\n\n…will not work in one of your locations :( This makes me sad…\n\nSo, in order to cheer up your CSS, you can give it a little bit of .NET Omph…\n\nThe first thing you need to do is get .NET to handle ALL of your requests, and not just for the ASP.NET pages.\n\n[![image](images/ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAdd a “Wildcard application mapping” to the “aspnet_isapi.dll” and you are good to go…\n\nTo process the css we need an HttpHandler, this is dead easy to implement and action so:\n\n```\nImports System.Web\nImports System.Text.RegularExpressions\n\n\nPublic Class CssHttpHandler\n    Implements IHttpHandler\n\n    Public ReadOnly Property IsReusable() As Boolean Implements System.Web.IHttpHandler.IsReusable\n        Get\n            Return False\n        End Get\n    End Property\n\n    Public Sub ProcessRequest(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext) Implements System.Web.IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest\n        context.Response.ContentType = \"text/css\"\n\n        'Get the file from the query stirng\n        Dim File As String = context.Request.FilePath\n\n        ' Find the actual path\n        Dim Path As String = context.Server.MapPath(File)\n\n        'Limit to only css files\n        If Not System.IO.Path.GetExtension(Path) = \".css\" Then\n            context.Response.End()\n        End If\n\n        'Make sure file exists\n        If Not System.IO.File.Exists(Path) Then\n            context.Response.End()\n        End If\n\n\n        ' Open the file, read the contents and replace the variables\n        Using css As System.IO.StreamReader = New System.IO.StreamReader(Path)\n            Dim cssText As String = css.ReadToEnd()\n\n            ' Replace url's\n            Dim rximg As New Regex(\"url('*(.+?)'*)\")\n            For Each m As Match In rximg.Matches(cssText)\n                cssText = cssText.Replace(m.Groups(1).Value, HandleRootOperator(m.Groups(1).Value))\n            Next\n\n            context.Response.Write(\"/* Please use the ~ operator in front of all URL's. e.g. url('~/UI/Resources/Images/Image.gif') will be converted at runtime to point at the root of the application. */\" & vbCrLf & cssText)\n        End Using\n\n    End Sub\n\n    ' Methods\n    Public Function HandleRootOperator(ByVal virtualUrl As String) As String\n        If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(virtualUrl) Then\n            If virtualUrl.StartsWith(\"^~/\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then\n                Return (\"^\" & Me.applicationPath & virtualUrl.Substring(2))\n            End If\n            If virtualUrl.StartsWith(\"~/\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then\n                Return (Me.applicationPath & virtualUrl.Substring(1))\n            End If\n        End If\n        Return virtualUrl\n    End Function\n\n\n\n\n    ' Fields\n    Private applicationPath As String = IIf((HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath.Length > 1), HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath, String.Empty)\n\n\nEnd Class\n```\n\nNow add the Handler to you web.config\n\n```\n<httpHandlers>\n  <add verb=\"*\" path=\"*.css\" type=\"Company.System.Product.CssHttpHandler, Company.System.Product\" />\n</httpHandlers>\n```\n\nAnd you are done :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Windows](http://technorati.com/tags/Windows) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject)\n",

Is that why I can’t spell?\n{ .post-img }\n\nEven though that sounds nice for a while (I miss University), it is neither the source of the phrase nor is it the cause of my spelling problems… In fact it is more than spelling, I sometimes find it difficult to keep up with the stuff coming out of my brain. My inability to write with a pen properly, yup, and write to save myself is also a symptom of the same thing, and you should see me knocking thing over and generally being clumsy.\n\nThese things are all symptoms of something generally called [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") but may other mislabels have been applied to it; Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD/ADHD), Dyscalculia/Acalculia, Dysgraphia/Agraphia, and Hyperactivity, all of which I have been accused of. You may call this a disability, and most do, but it is really a gift.\n\nThe more you read about [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") the more you you find things that sound cool…\n\n> _The way pupils are taught today is counterproductive for people with a creative, visual and multidimensional thinking style. Like the sportsman who needs the right clothing to reach peak performance, pupils with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") need to be taught in a way that suits their learning style.  \n> BBC -_ [_http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/llandeilo/pages/caroline_keen.shtml_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/llandeilo/pages/caroline_keen.shtml)\n\nThe current education system, pretty much the world over, has some deficits where, funnily enough, learning is concerned. A full third of the population of the world and 80% if the population of Scottish prisons have “dyslexic tendencies”, whatever that is. These people have a disadvantage in the current system because of there lack of 2-d perception.\n\n> _The right-brained and dyslexic thinker will most often have the ability to collect vast amounts of information on a topic, comprehend it on many analytical levels and then use it in a wide array of creative applications. The right-brained person is generally not satisfied until all possibilities are gathered and added to the “whole picture” and then utilized.  \n> dyslexiavictoria.ca -_ [_http://www.dyslexiavictoria.ca/Glossary.php_](http://www.dyslexiavictoria.ca/Glossary.php)\n\n[![image](images/AmIastonerhippy_146A1-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-AmIastonerhippy_146A1-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have heard of a number of companies who will only employ dyslexic people for particular jobs, the most notable of which is a Architectural company that has only dyslexic Architects because of their enhanced multidimensional perception.\n\n> _Ron Davis explains that multi-dimensional thinking (using all the senses) takes place much faster than verbal thinking. Dyslexics also tend to be more curious, creative, and intuitive than average. They tend to be highly aware of the environment, inventive, and good at real world tasks. Their special mode of thought also produces the gift of mastery: once they have learned something experientially, they understand it on such a deep level that they know how to do things intuitively without thinking about how.  \n> [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\").com -_ [_http://www.dyslexia.com/bookstore/giftbook.htm_](http://www.dyslexia.com/bookstore/giftbook.htm)\n\nThere are many famous dyslexic people the world over, including: Walt Disney, Tom Cruise, Thomas Edison, Babe Ruth, Alexander Graham Bell, and John F.
