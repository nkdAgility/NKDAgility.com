    Although many of my customers have been having a go at installing Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 themselves one or two have had issues. While these issues are easily resolved it is sometimes nice to have someone else who has done the same thing a bunch of times take the rains.

    - [TFS 2012 Update 1 – TF255430: the database was partially upgraded during a failed upgrade](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-2012-update-1-tf255430-the-database-was-partially-upgraded-during-a-failed-upgrade/)

    This upgrade should take no more than 3 hours as I have only two servers to worry about and 40GB of data.

    There are a couple of pre-requisites that you can get out of the way to make your install and upgrade a lot smother and if you are upgrading from a previous version of TFS this is exactly the same procedure. You can go strait from Team Foundation Server 2008 SP1 or Team Foundation Server 2010 SP1 to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 without much trouble. I would however suggest that for a full version upgrade that you “move to new hardware” as part of the upgrade. This will give you a chance to upgrade SharePoint, SQL Server and whatever other components you have on there and more notably you get to clean all the plaque off your crusty server for a nice shiny.

    Note You can’t upgrade TFS 2005 to TFS 2012. You will need to go to TFS 2008 or TFS 2010 first.

    For the satellite systems:

    Things you will need:

    - **Disk space**  
       You should make sure that you have at least 20GB of free space at any time on your primary partition. This usually looks like 100GB primary and 100GB secondary depending on how big your data is.
    - **Accounts**  
       Make sure that you have access to all of the usernames and passwords that you may be using in your environment. This means the TFS Setup, TFS Service & TFS Reports as well as any Build, Test or Lab management accounts that were used
    - **Media**  
       Depending on what you have installed you will need all of the media that correlates to that installation. You may be thinking that you can just download it on the fly, but what if the internet goes down or is just slow. I have been onsite with very slow connections.

    Once you have all of these things ready and confirmed you can run the upgrade. Refer to the more detailed documentation for previous version of TFS, here I am doing a Team Foundation Server 2012 to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 upgrade only.

    ## Checklist for Upgrading to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    I always like to have a short measurable checklist

    1. DONE **Free up disk space for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 (added 1.5 hours to Upgrade)**

       This server has limited disk space so I had to uninstall a bunch of things that did not need to be there… like Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate.

    2. DONE **Backup before Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 (15 minutes)**

       This is imperative and not optional in any way. Even better take the backup off server!

    3. DONE **Upgrade Application Tier to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 (30 minutes)**
    4. DONE **Configure Application Tier and upgrade Schema to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 (30 minutes)**
    5. DONE **Upgrade Build Server to Team Foundation Build 2012 Update 1 (XX minutes)**

    Lets get going…

    ## Free up disk space for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    There are a number of things that folks like to install on there Team Foundation Server that have no business there. The first and most common thing is client tools. Do not install Visual Studio or any variant of it on your production Team Foundation Server. This takes up tons of disk space and complicates any upgrade as you need to worry about also patching Visual Studio to the same level. If you don’t have Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server patched to the same level you can get “unstable” behaviour from your system. Don’t take the risk and don’t install it here.

    Any client tools that you do need can be installed locally on your workstation or on a build server where you have to install the client tools anyway. Another option that I often use is to have a Windows 7/8 VM in your environment that is all setup with the client tools and is specifically for Administration and configuration of TFS. So it would have the Power Tools, Sidekicks and anything else that you might need.

    ## Backup before Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    The easiest way to backup TFS is to use the add-on from the product team that comes with the power tools. This tool takes care of the heavy lifting and as it is from the TFS Product Team works great.

    - [Creating a backup in Team Foundation Server 2010 using the Power Tools](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/creating-a-backup-in-team-foundation-server-2010-using-the-power-tools/ "http://blog.hinshelwood.com/creating-a-backup-in-team-foundation-server-2010-using-the-power-tools/")

    If you are using the Database Backup Tools then all you need to do is take a Full Backup before you get started.

    ![Backup before Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image20-1-1.png "Backup before Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Backup before Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    The backup here takes a backup of all of the databases associated with TFS, Reporting Services and SharePoint so you have a full reference. The only database of any size is the Collection database which in this case is around 40GB of data which is mostly in Version Control.

    ![Verify backups before installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image21-2-2.png "Verify backups before installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Verify backups before installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Once the backup is complete and you have verified that the files exist (I am paranoid) then you can start with the upgrade.

    ## Upgrade Application Tier to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    The upgrade process is mostly automated with a little bit of configuration that would would do for any upgrade whatever version of Team Foundation Server you are upgrading from.

    ![Upgrade components to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 ](images/image35-14-14.png "Upgrade components to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 ")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Upgrade components to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    The installer will handle removing the old components and installing the new ones for you. You will then however need to do the configuration of this new App Tier to talk to your existing data tier and that's where the real upgrade starts.

    ![You may be asked to reboot a bunch for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image24-3-3.png "You may be asked to reboot a bunch for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You may be asked to reboot a bunch for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Many of the components that both Team Foundation Server and the Operating System relies on will be updated as part of this process so you may be asked to restart. In this case I had to bounce the server twice and the installation automatically restarted once I logged in.

    Note The installation restarts for the first user with admin that logs onto the server. I had one case of the ops team wondering why the server was bouncing and they logged onto the console in the data centre before we could remotely. Took us 10 minutes to figure out what went wrong and then had to talk the operations team through the process without being able to see the screen.

    This part of the upgrade while fairly fast can take a good 15-30 minutes depending on the  speed of your system and the components that you have installed.

    ## Configure Application Tier and upgrade Schema to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    Once the installation has completed we are presented with the usual Configuration Wizard page but it has defaulted to an Upgrade.

    ![Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 Upgrade Wizard](images/image25-4-4.png "Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 Upgrade Wizard")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 Upgrade Wizard**

    For security reasons the wizard will NOT populate the same account that you used previously. You will need to manually specify each account, in this case the TFS Service & TFS Reports accounts as well as enter the password.

    ![Select the database to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image26-5-5.png "Select the database to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Select the database to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    As you may have more than one TFS instance in the same database you need to tell TFS which one is yours. In this case I only have one anyway but it does tell me the version of the database that I will be upgrading. Again we have the obligatory “I confirm that I have a current backup” to make sure that you have. No really… don’t just tick it.. make sure, verify again, that you indeed have  backup of all of your TFS databases. I have indeed needed to restore a database and re-run the upgrade.

    ![Select the Warehouse to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image27-6-6.png "Select the Warehouse to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Select the Warehouse to upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Again there could be more than one warehouse and unlike previous version of Team Foundation Server, Team Foundation Server 2012 will upgrade the warehouse so that you don't have to spend so long recreating it and are back up and running quicker.

    ![image](images/image28-7-7.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Verification checks found TF400432 during upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    During the upgrade I found an issue with communicating with SharePoint but it was very easy to solve.

    - [TFS 2012 Update 1 – TF400432 We were unable to connect to the SharePoint Central Administration](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-2012-update-1-tf400432-we-were-unable-to-connect-to-the-sharepoint-central-administration/ "http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-2012-update-1-tf400432-we-were-unable-to-connect-to-the-sharepoint-central-administration/")

    I fixed this after the upgrade was complete so there is no reason to stop and try to fix it during the upgrade. You may however need to manually fix something.

    ![Successful upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image29-8-8.png "Successful upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Successful upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    The upgrade completed successfully, but it was not able to add the TFS account to the SharePoint Farm Administrators group which makes perfect sense as it has the wrong post for the Administration Site.

    ![Verify that you have Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image30-9-9.png "Verify that you have Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Verify that you have Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Now for a couple of checks:

    1. Version in TFS Administration Console is correct
    2. Web access is up and running

    Awesome…

    The last thing that I did was to update the Power Tools to the latest version so that there was no mismatch.

    ![Get and install the Power Tools that match the version you installed](images/image31-10-10.png "Get and install the Power Tools that match the version you installed")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Get and install the Power Tools that match the version you installed**

    Now that the Team Foundation Server is upgraded we only have the Build Server to do in this configuration.

    ## Upgrade Build Server to Team Foundation Build 2012 Update 1

    On the build server you run the upgrade in exactly the same way that you did for the Application Tier. This takes a while as the same C++ components require a restart or two.

    ### Part 1 – Recreate the Controller (TFS Application Tier)

    Because we reinstalled the TFS Server where ther controller was configured we do need to reconfigure that controller. When you run the wizard it will ask you it you want to keep the configuration the same as what was previously configured. In essence replace the existing item.

    ![Replace the old controller with the new one](images/image32-11-11.png "Replace the old controller with the new one")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Replace the old controller with the new one**

    This will reactivate the same controller instance that you had before with the same configuration.

    ### Part 2 – Recreate the Agents (TFS Build Server)

    With our controller now configured on the TFS Application Tier we now need to activate the agents on the build server. First we upgrade the build server to Update 1.

    ![Installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image33-12-12.png "Installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Installing Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    On the build agents you will just be presented with the generic “pick a wizard” page and you should select the “Configure a build service”.

    ![Select Configure a build service for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image34-13-13.png "Select Configure a build service for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Select Configure a build service for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Now you go through the same configuration that you would for creating a new set of Agents. As with the controller you will be asked if you want to maintain the configuration from before for this server and all you need to do is say “Yes” and it will be configured for you in the same way.

    ## Conclusion

    Upgrading from Team Foundation Server 2012 to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 is a fairly strait forward task but as with anything to do with TFS there can be a lot of moving parts. I would describe this as a simple installation and there were few gotchas.

    Other installations and upgrade are not quite so simple…

    When running the upgrade from Team Foundation Server 2012 to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 you get a TF400432 error stating that the Team Foundation Server configuration was unable to connect to SharePoint administration site.

    [![TF400432 : We were unable to connect to the SharePoint Central Administration site](images/image23_thumb-2-2.png "TF400432 : We were unable to connect to the SharePoint Central Administration site")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/12/image23.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF400432 : We were unable to connect to the SharePoint Central Administration site**

    You get the error:

    > TF400432 : We were unable to connect to the SharePoint Central Administration site: [http://tfsserver:17000/](http://tfsserver:17000/).  While you may continue with the upgrade, there will be manual configuration steps required to use Team Foundation Server with this SharePoint site in the future.  It is recommended that you correct this SharePoint issue before continuing. See the configuration log for additional details that may assist in troubleshooting the problem.

    ### Applies to:

    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    ### Findings for TF400432

    It looks like at some point the port for SharePoint Administration was changed but never updated in the Team Foundation Server configuration. While Team Foundation Server thinks that the port is 17000 the actual port is 28230.

    ### Solution for TF400432

    There are two options. I can change SharePoint to be the same port that Team Foundation Server is expecting, or I can update Team Foundation Server to use the correct port.

    ![Update the SharePoint link from Team Foundation Server to the correct value](images/image19-1-1.png "Update the SharePoint link from Team Foundation Server to the correct value")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Update the SharePoint link from Team Foundation Server to the correct value**

    In this case updating Team Foundation Server was easier than messing with SharePoint. You can update the Central Administration URL from “Team Foundation Server Administration Console | Application Tier | SharePoint Web Application | Select Site | Change” and then update the URL and click OK.

    Did you know that you can use Teams without areas using a team field in TFS? There are numerous reasons to do this but the decision should not be taken lightly.

    Although not the default it will give you greater versatility in configuring for a [single Team Project](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/one-team-project/) with the ability to then use area solely for Product. Lets say that you have a bunch of products and four teams that work on those products. No team particularly owns those Products as you have many more Products than Teams and you have a single backlog of ordered work that represents work across all of those products.

    - Update Microsoft has now added MSDN documentation for [Customize a team project to support team fields](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dn144940.aspx)
    - Update Another Visual Studio ALM MVP, Rene van Osnabrugge has created a walk through for [customising the reports to support 'team field'](http://osnabrugge.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/teams-without-areasfixing-the-reports/).
    - Breaking newsWith [TFS 2013 Update 3 (TFS 2013.3)](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2933779) the Test team have converted Test Plan and Test Suit to Work Items and enabled Team Field support. Awesome!

    Indeed within a single Sprint a Team may touch multiple products and they are all released on the same cadence. Is this ideal… well no.. it can be hard to create working software against a single piece of software let alone multiple. But lets for a moment assume that all your products were built using TDD, they have a full automated UI suite of tests and every manual test is automated by the end of every sprint. Not only that but you have an automated and tested deployment that has been proven in Development, Quality Assurance and Production environments.

    In short you have continuous delivery and you are good at it.

    Now, while in this is a fantasy world for most companies there are yet others for which this is a reality. Look at the new 3 week shipping cadence of the Developer Division at Microsoft or the 6 week cycle for Chrome from Google.

    You can’t ship code to production in the form described above unless you are that good. If you are not then good then you may think about working on one Product for a release and then moving that team to another product for the next release. That would be an easier way and allow your teams to focus on one thing for a release. Still problematic but a little more manageable.

    There are only a few simple steps to achieve Teams without Areas with team field:

    1. DONE Create a Global List for 'team field'
    2. DONE Add the 'team field' field to PBI & Bug
    3. DONE Change the CommonProcessConfig.xml file to use 'team field'
    4. DONE Configure Team settings per 'team field'

    So lets get started.

    Warning Never make changes against a production TFS… Ever… Always test out your changes in a test server first

    Info If you are really awesome you should create CodedUI tests for all your common TFS user scenarios so that you can be sure that you have not broken anyone’s workflow without intent.

    ## Create a Global List for the 'team field'

    We first want to create a Global List to hold our list of Teams. This is really for two reasons. First in the Visual Studio Scrum 2.1 process template both PBI and Bug are owned by team members and appear on the backlog so a Global List need only be updated once for both Fields. Second we can easily build a tool to add items to the list and even if doing it manually we are not in danger of radically changing our Work Item Type Definition ever time we want to add something.

    ![Creating a Global List for the 'team field'](images/image4-10-10.png "Creating a Global List for the 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Creating a Global List for the 'team field'**

    If your TFS server has not yet been in use for builds and you have never created a global list then you will be presented with an intuitive empty box.

    ![Create a new global list for the 'team field'](images/image5-11-11.png "Create a new global list for the 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Create a new global list for the 'team field'**

    If you right click in the open space you will see a menu that you can use to first add a Global List and then populate it.

    ![Add all of the Teams to the global list](images/image6-12-12.png "Add all of teams to the global list")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add all of the Teams to the global list**

    Once you have populated your global list we can then move on to adding the custom field to the work item type definitions so that we can both select it in the UI and set the administration configuration for it.

    You can export your global list from the command line or through the UI for use on your production server once you have decided that this is the way for you.

    Info Always store your changes in Version Control so that you never loose them. Preferable not in the server that you are modifying. [http://tfs.visualstudio.com](http://tfs.visualstudio.com) is perfect for this.

    ## Add the 'team field' to PBI & Bug

    Now we need to add a custom field to all of the work item types that are defined in the  “Requirement Types” section of the Categories.xml file.  In the case of the Visual Studio Scrum process template this is both the Product Backlog Team and Bug.

    ```
    witadmin exportcategories /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /f:c:tempcategories.xml

    ```

    **Figure: Command line call to export categories**

    If you look in the file you will see an entry for “Requirement Category” that contains the things that we are looking for.

    **Figure: Requirement Category for Visual Studio Scrum 2.1**

    We need to update both or we will get an error, however we will be making the same change to both.

    ![Edit the PBI to add the 'team field'](images/image7-13-13.png "Edit the PBI to add the 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Edit the PBI to add the 'team field'**

    This will open the Product Backlog Item Work Item Type Definition from our test project in a UI tool that will make it faster to get all of the way through the changes. The nice thing about the UI is that it has listed all of the options and I don’t have to Google or remember them… I am pretty lazy aren't I…

    ![Add the 'team field' to the PBI](images/image8-14-14.png "Add the 'team field' to the PBI")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add the 'team field' to the PBI**

    I always follow the same format for creating custom fields. I think that most of the ALM MVP’s and Consultants out there do the same so…

    The Name should be in the format “\[what you want\] (\[comapny\])”. This allows you to see which are custom fields in the cube. The reference name should be just the opposite with no spaces or special characters. So it becomes \[company\].\[CamelCaseName\] and allows me to also identify it easily.

    I am setting this as a Dimension so that I can use it to slice any of my reports. You will need to modify the OOB reports to add this to them, but anything that you create you can add this out of the gate.

    ![Adding the Rules to the 'team field' ](images/image9-15-15.png "Adding the Rules to the 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adding the Rules to the 'team field'**

    I am adding two specific rules and you may add more but this is the basics. First add AllowExistingValues so that if you delete a team in the future you are not left with Work Items in a broken state. Then we need to get to the meat and add the AllowedValues.

    ![Add the 'team field' global list to the allowed values](images/image10-1-1.png "Add the 'team field' global list to the allowed values")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add the 'team field' global list to the allowed values**

    The global list should appear in the UI and be selectable. This will load the values and create a drop down list on the UI (once we have added it) to allow users to select Team.

    **Figure: Xml for the 'team field'**

    But we are not done yet. we still need to add the field to the UI.

    ![Where to put the 'team field'](images/image11-2-2.png "Where to put the 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Where to put the 'team field'**

    In the PBI form there is a nice little space below Reason that I want to utilise. So lets add the field to the UI.

    ![Add a new control for the 'team field' data](images/image12-3-3.png "Add a new control for the 'team field' data")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add a new control for the 'team field' data**

    We just need to add a new generic control to the UI where we want it. Most of the layout is taken care of automatically so we only have a few fields to fill out…

    ![Set the field name and the label for the 'team field' to show](images/image13-4-4.png "Set the field name and the label for the 'team field' to show")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Set the field name and the label for the 'team field' to show**

    We have only added a simple reference to the data and Team Foundation Server will figure out how to render it on both Web and thick client alike.

    **Figure: The new control XML for the 'team field'**

    Once you have added this you will need to refresh the cache in Visual Studio before you will see the new list on the Work Items.

    ![New 'team field' is now on the form](images/image14-5-5.png "New 'team field' is now on the form")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: New 'team field' is now on the form**

    Warning Remember that this field and control will need added to all of the Requirement Types that you have set for your process template.

    Info The easy way to add this field to other work item types is to export the XML and add it manually.

    ```
    witadmin exportwitd /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /n:"Product Backlog Item" /f:c:temppbi.xml
    witadmin exportwitd /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /n:"Bug" /f:c:tempbug.xml
    witadmin importwitd /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /f:c:tempbug.xml

    ```

    **Figure: Export both, edit the bug and then import it to add team without areas**

    Once you have added these changes to all of the Requirement Types that you have configured you can move on to configuring TFS to look at this new field and not Area.

    ## Change the CommonProcessConfig.xml file to use the 'team field'

    We now need to tell Team Foundation Server to use this new field by changing the Common Processing Configuration that the web access uses to figure out what is going on with a particular process template.

    ```
    witadmin exportcommonprocessconfig /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /f:c:tempcpc.xml

    ```

    **Figure: Export the common process config to xml**

    Once you have the xml file you can open it in your favourite IDE and find the TypeField with the Type of Team.

    ![Edit the TypeField for Team to use the new 'team field'](images/image15-6-6.png "Edit the TypeField for Team to use the new 'team field'")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Edit the TypeField for Team to use the new 'team field'**

    You can literally just change the refname from the current Area Path value..

    **Figure: Original Team value for TypeField**

    To the new Teams field that we created earlier..

    **Figure: New Team value for TypeField**

    Now save and import the new common process configuration we are nearly there.

    ```
    witadmin importcommonprocessconfig /collection:http://kraken:8080/tfs/Tfs01/ /p:TeamsWithoutAreas /f:c:tempcpc.xml

    ```

    **Figure: Import new common process configuiration file**

    And we are almost done. we now need to go to the Web Interface and tell it for each team, what value is theirs…

    ## Configure Team settings per Team without Areas

    This is the final part of the configuration and once you go into your Team boards of backlog you will get a lovely message:

    > TF400512: You have not selected any areas for your team. You must select at least one area before you can use features such as the product backlog, the task board or tiles.

    Well lets do what it says and head over to the administration pages for this team by clicking the nicely provided “Select team’s areas” link.

    ![New Team Field tab has been added to the Administration](images/image16-7-7.png "New Team Field tab has been added to the Administration")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: New Team Field tab has been added to the Administration**

    We now have a brand new tab on our administration section for “team field” so that we can select one or more “areas” from our new field values that this team is responsible for.

    ![This is Team 1 from the list ](images/image17-8-8.png "This is Team 1 from the list ")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: This is Team 1 from the list**

    Now when we create new work items as part of this team they will default to selecting this drop down and not our Product hierarchy that is in Area Path.

    ![Team is now set instead of Area Path by default](images/image18-9-9.png "Team is now set instead of Area Path by default")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team is now set instead of Area Path by default**

    If you were using this new drop down for Product rather than Team you may want to have multiple values owned by this team and that is allowed in the configuration. I would only recommend that however when you really need hierarchical teams that Area Path can provide or at least simulate.

    ## Conclusion

    This has merit when the situation dictates and I have recommended it twice now with some of my colleagues coming around to the idea.

    And remember that any changes to your process template should be well thought out as you don’t want to end up with fragmented templates if you have more than one Team Project or worse, end up with a frankin-template that no one wants to use.

    Just be careful out there…

    We have had a large number of customers over the years that desperately want to move from Quality Centre (now HP ALM) to… well… anything else to be honest. The current leader in the ALM space just happens to be my favourite tool, Team Foundation Server, and so I am continuously on the lookout for tools that can help us migrate from whatever the customer is using to Team Foundation Server.

    ![Gartner rates Team Foundation Server as top ALM tool](images/image3-3-3.png "Gartner rates Team Foundation Server as top ALM tool")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Gartner rates Team Foundation Server as top ALM tool**

    There are currently three third party , one Microsoft and one HP tool in the migration and sync space for Quality Centre to Team Foundation Server and all of them have their drawbacks… there never is a perfect solution for migration or synchronisation, but there are a few tools in the Synchronisation space that are worth it and for Quality Centre there is one tool that can cut the Migration mustard.

    But first there are a number of questions that we need to ask ourselves:

    1. Do we want to just Sync the content or Migrate it?
    2. Do we want history or TIP?
    3. Do we want unidirectional or bidirectional?

    And that is just part of the puzzle; So lets look at the players in this space…

    ### TFS Integration Platform - [http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/](http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/ "http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/")

    The TFS Integration Platform is an ALM Rangers project that is supported by a few guys on the product team and includes a bi-directional syncing engine that can handle both Migrations and Synchronisations between ultimately any platform and any other platform. It does this by allowing you to create an adapter for whatever system that you need and comes with a number of out-of-the-box adapters:

    - TFS 2008
    - TFS 2010
    - TFS 2012
    - SubVersion
    - Rational ClearCase
    - Rational ClearQuest

    Unfortunately this is a high maintenance system that is really only usable by experienced consultants for all but the most simple of tasks. In addition, **to support HP Quality Centre would require the creation of a custom adapter** that in my experience would take many weeks to perfect. If the TFS Integration Platform were more fully supported or there were more adapters available it could be a real contender in this space. As it is I have created a number of customer Adapters for it and it has a clunky API that is difficult to extent.

    This is not the solution for us in this case… but it should be!

    ### OpsHub - [http://www.opshub.com](http://www.opshub.com "http://www.opshub.com")

    _(I was unable to get a “trial” version of this software and I am inherently cynical about any vendor that does not provide working software!)_

    It currently looks like OpsHub is the top player with both Synchronisation and full history Migration but it is difficult to tell as they do not provide a downloadable trial. I don’t know about you, but unless I can run and verify a feature myself I take claim of capabilities with a pinch of salt. To date I have only seen evidence to claim synchronisation and not migration which is just fine. What is the difference you might ask, surely if you can do one you can do the other… well kind of.. more on that later…

    ![image](images/image1-1-1.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: OpsHub integration**

    OpsHub Integrates with [many companies products](http://www.opshub.com/main/index.php/2012-08-31-18-28-21/partners) and if they can do half of what they claim then it will be a very powerful tool…

    ### TaskTop Sync - [http://tasktop.com/sync](http://tasktop.com/sync "http://tasktop.com/sync")

    _(I was unable to get a “trial” version of this software and I am inherently cynical about any vendor that does not provide working software!)_

    TaskTop is the new kid on the block and now provides a solution called TaskTop Sync that allows us to Sync data on the server side between many systems. This is not migration and it will not take history, but it does allow you to access data from many ALM system from a single UI and to allow you to sync limited data between these systems.

    ![TaskTop-Sync-Mapping](images/TaskTop-Sync-Mapping-8-8.png "TaskTop-Sync-Mapping")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configuring TaskTop Sync**

    - Team Foundation Server
    - IBM Rational
    - Borland StarTeam
    - HP Quality Centre
    - VersionOne
    - ScrumWorks
    - [Many more…](http://tasktop.com/connectors)

    If you have a very fragmented set of systems and you have no intention of consolidating them then a Sync tool is for you. I would always prefer to rationalise down to as few product sets as I can get away with but many organisation find this almost impossible within their existing culture. If you are in that situation then TaskTop provides many of those at the Work Item Tracking layer as it allows you to map only specified fields between the different products. That way you are only mapping what you need…

    I am however unsure how it supports Work Item Types as the only demos show mapping of Defects in HP to Tasks in TFS. This is not how I would map anything and I have not seen how configurable it is…

    ### Scrat

    Scrat is specifically designed to move data easily from Quality Centre to Team Foundation Server. I have worked with this tool before and I have a number of customers that have used it to successfully migrate all of their data to TFS. It has been a while since I used it, but I found it to be a very easy to follow process even accounting for all of the mappings that you are asked to provide.

    ![](images/Scrat_04.jpg)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Scrat configuration**

    This is the only tool that I can confirm that is capable of moving Test Steps as part of the migration.

    ### HP ALM Synchronizer

    HP themselves provide a synchronisation tool but there are many fields that they just can’t map. This tool was designed by HP to make sure that it was impossible to be used to “migrate” from HP to another system. This, if you think about it, makes perfect sense. It is however very free…

    ![image](images/image2-2-2.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Mapping TFS and HP entities**

    The tool supports a number of other ALM tools:

    - HP Application Lifecycle Management 11.00 and HP Quality Center 10.00.
    - Rational ClearQuest 2003.06.15; 2003.06.16; 7.0; 7.0.1; and 7.1.
    - Rational RequisitePro 2003.06.15; 2003.06.16; 7.0; 7.0.1; and 7.1.
    - Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 and 2010.

    It will allow for limited Syncing of content between the two systems. If this is all you need then it may be of use to you…

    ## Conclusion for Quality Centre to Team Foundation Server

    So there are three third party , one Microsoft and one HP tool that can move data in some fashion between Quality Centre and Team Foundation Server: TFS Integration Platform, OpsHub, TaskTop Sync, Scrat and HP ALM Synchronizer. Most of these are synchronisation tools but one stands out as a Migration tool.

    It is inherently not in the best interests of a Synchronisation tool to allow you to migrate data from one system to another. Once you do that, why would you need the synchronisation tool any more. The whole idea is to lock you into keeping both tools and thus extending your need for the synchronisation tool. In my honest opinion if you want to remove the need for the other tools, whatever that may be, you need to be looking at Migration tools and not synchronisation tools.

    Migration is the ability to move from one system to another without requiring to keep the old one around. You may need it anyway for audit or fuzzies, but it is not required for function. This would be a true migration where you bring all of the data, maybe the history, and pull it across into another system.

    Synchronisation is the ability to have two different items in two different systems linked in some way and have certain specified data points updated dynamically between them. With synchronisation we are not really concerned with unique data points to the individual systems as not only are we keeping them around but these uniqueness's are normally why we are doing so.

    **Figure: Comparison of products**

    So if you just want to synchronise I would recommend starting with “**HP ALM Synchronizer**” and verifying if the features meet you needs. If not then push out to “**OpsHub”** as it looks to have the better feature set and widest support for tools. If you are Migrating your Quality Centre implementation to TFS then the only choice is **Scrat**.

    You get an error while upgrading Team Foundation Server 2012 to Update 1 with a “TF254027: You must correct all errors before you continue”, “TF255375: the configuration database that you specified cannot be used” and a “TF255430: the database was partially upgraded during a failed upgrade”.

    ![image](images/image-1-1.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF255375 and TF255430 configuration database cannot be used due to a failed upgrade**

    The result of this is that you have an inaccessible environment until it is either upgraded successfully or restored to the RTM.

    ### Applies to

    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    ### Findings for TF255430

    The only way to figure out what went wrong it to look at the log. You can see the little “Open Log” option in the results and there is also an “Open Log folder” as part of the “Logs” node in the Administration Console.

    On examining the logs the first thing that I found was a SQL Server communication error.

    ```
    [Error  @16:22:24.739]

    ```

    **Figure: TF246017: Team Foundation Server could not connect to the database.**

    This would defiantly cause the upgrade to fail and if it happened half way through the Upgrade of the Configuration database would defiantly result in the messages above. Now, prior to running the upgrade the TFS Upgrade Wizard did check that not only could it connect to SQL Server correctly, but that the accounts in use had the appropriate permissions to perform the update.

    The second thing that I found was

    ```
    [Error  @16:18:24.966] TF400670: Error encountered when creating connection to Analysis Services. Contact your Team Foundation Server administrator.

Contact your Team Foundation Server administrator.. For more information, see the configuration log.
    [Info   @16:18:25.184] Completed UpgradeConfigDB: Error

    ```

    **Figure: TF400670: Error encountered when creating connection to Analysis Services**

    It looks like this might be the culprit as it is followed by an “UpgradeConfigDB: Error” statement. Again it looks like a network glitch trying to open a connection to the SQL Server that was hosting Analysis Services. With these two errors I would surmise that there might be an intermittent network problem that while a running server would be resilient to it an upgrade is a much longer transactional process and thus hit the issue.

    Following the instructions and  restoring the backup and rerunning should solve the issue as it is not an issue with the upgrade itself.

    ### Solution for TF255430 – Restore your data from a backup

    As this really all boils down to the TF255430 then we should follow the instructions above as “You must restore your data from a backup to its original state to continue”.

    In this case we restored the collection, re-ran the update and all was well.

    If you are installing any updates to Team Foundation Server follow these simple steps:

    1. **Analyse  
       **Run the Best Practices Analyser to make sure that your TFS Server is healthy and highlight any problems that you can fix first
    2. **Quiesce  
       **Make your TFS and SharePoint environments inaccessible so that the backups are all at the same version
    3. **Backup**  
       Backup all data using the Team Foundation Server backup tool from the power tools
    4. **Snapshot**  
       Make sure that you take a Snapshot of both your application tier and data tier at the same time index.
    5. **Update**  
       You should make sure that all of the components of your Team Foundation Server environment are up to data. That means installing ALL Microsoft Updates for both Windows and other products.
    6. **Upgrade**  
       Then run the upgrade with the knowledge that you have done everything possible to make sure things go smoothly.

    These simple steps should mitigate any future issues and should find any communication issues as well…

    As usual I am going to update my local Team Foundation Server environment to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 first and with Windows 8 and Hyper-V that is easy. If you are creating a new Team Foundation Server 2012 instance you can just install directly from the Update 1 media. Its all there…

    - Update 2012-12 - new post: [Upgrading to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 in production – DONE](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-to-team-foundation-server-2012-update-1-in-production-done/)

    ![Revert your snapshot before you install Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/SNAGHTML658191c-9-9.png "Revert your snapshot before you install Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Revert your snapshot before you install Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    If you are installing against a production box make sure that you take a snapshot before you proceed. You can delete it after we have tested the upgrade but you should always take the snapshot.

    ![Visual Studio 2012 Q1 Team Foundation Server](images/image56-1-1.png "Visual Studio 2012 Q1 Team Foundation Server")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1 includes the full install**  
    One of the main things to note is that this is a full copy of Team Foundation Server 2012 that includes Update 1. So if you are installing Team Foundation Server from scratch then this install replaces the previous one and you can no longer download Team Foundation Server without Update 1.

    ![Upgrading Team Foundation Server 2012 to Update 1](images/image57-2-2.png "Upgrading Team Foundation Server 2012 to Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Upgrading to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    The install is easy and it will detect wither you have an existing install of Team foundation Server before proceeding.

    If you have Team Foundation Server 2008 or 2010 it will ask you to uninstall this first (don’t worry your data would still be intact) and then it would launch a choice of wizards. If you already have Team Foundation Server 2012 it will run through the upgrade process and present you with the upgrade wizard.

    ![Upgrading the Brian Keller VM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image58-3-3.png "Upgrading the Brian Keller VM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Upgrading the Brian Keller VM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Depending on what else you have installed and which version of your OS you are running on you may get asked to reboot. This is what messed up many folks installing the update on Brian Keller's VM.  The trick there is to disable the date manipulation scripts that run on start-up prior to any reboots.

    You should however [wait until Brian adds Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 to the ALM Virtual Machine](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2012/11/27/visual-studio-2012-update-1-and-the-alm-virtual-machine.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2012/11/27/visual-studio-2012-update-1-and-the-alm-virtual-machine.aspx") this week.

    But I digress…

    ### Configuration of Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1

    Once you run the install and maybe do a couple of reboot you will be done…

    As I mentioned before if you are upgrading from a previous version it will present you with the main Configuration Center where you can choose what you want to do… Upgrade being the correct choice ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile2-10-10.png) unless you have a more complex install then do an “Advanced” install and then a “tfsconfig /import” command to pull in and upgrade your 2008 or 2010 detached collections.

    ![Upgrade of an TFS 2012 RTM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image60-5-5.png "Upgrade of an TFS 2012 RTM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Upgrade of an TFS 2012 RTM to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    However with an existing TFS 2012 instance you will automatically be presented with the Upgrade wizard as it can kina guess what you want…

    ![Choosing your database for upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image61-6-6.png "Choosing your database for upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Choosing your database for upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    Now, just as you would do for any upgrade you will need to verify all of the configuration details, but it will default to the existing ones. One unfortunate thing is that you will need to know the passwords for any custom accounts that you are using.

    ![Enter your Report Reader Account for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image62-7-7.png "Enter your Report Reader Account for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Enter your Report Reader Account for Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    At a minimum you will need your Report Reader Account password and maybe your TFS Service account password. This is a security restriction but we are hoping that Microsoft will allow us to use the same values that are already stored, but for now we need to fill it out… this is the primary reason that we even get the wizard…

    In the real world I dought that many folks will be changing their settings as part of this type of upgrade, but I guess it could happen…

    ![All green an good with the Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1](images/image63-8-8.png "All green an good with the Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: All green an good with the Team Foundation Server 2012 Update 1**

    This is an easy update with very low risk and can be done in place if you are upgrading from the 2012 RTM.

    It takes a little more planning to go from 2008 or 2010 to 2012, but it is ultimately just as easy.

    I have talked before on the [new normal for software development](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/the-new-normal-of-the-modern-application-lifecycle/) as part of the Visual Studio 2012 launch events and Microsoft in itself is not immune to this change.

    We as consumers will no longer stand for applications that make us wait for 6 months for a new version let alone 2 years. New features need to be delivered much more frequently to the consumer and the biggest blocker to this is the culture of both the organisation releasing the software and their customers.

    The tradition of delivering software every two years so as to minimise disruption to our customer is a fallacy that fear and poor quality have driven us to. It is time to recant on these old poor practices and fix the underlying issues that we have been papering over tissue paper.

    This, by the way, is one of the underlying reasons that the Scrum Framework asks us to create working deployable software at least every 30 days.

    Most companies however don’t believe this and in my experience I hear one of the following:

    - “We are not a software company”
    - “That does not work with our software”
    - “not even Microsoft can do this, so how can we”

    These are all just a “cop out” for organisations that do not want, or think that they do not need to suck it up and fix the underlying problems with their software. Well, Microsoft has decided to not just join the party, but lead the way very publically.

    So, you know how big Visual Studio is? Well there is Visual Studio IDE, then there is Team Foundation Server and Office integration and… well you get the picture.

    ![image](images/image55-1-1.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Visual Studio 2012 Platform**

    Microsoft is now leading the way with Visual Studio and Visual Studio is on of the most complex applications I can think of.

    They have moved both the [Visual Studio IDE and Team Foundation Server to continuous delivery](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/08/28/tfs-shipping-cadence.aspx) with a 3 monthly cadence. Yes, that means that you should now be upgrading your Team Foundation Server every Quarter and that your developers should be updating their client. But you know what… they don’t have to.

    With the move to continuous delivery comes many problems that need solving that you just have to fix. We have always know that we had these problem but rather than fix them, we implemented dysfunctional behaviour around them to reduce their impact.

    - How to deploy with minimal production impact?
    - How to update the database without hours of down time?
    - How to update different components of our application on different cadences?
    - What if I update one and not the other?

    If you solve these problems not only will you be able to deliver more frequently, but what you will deliver will be in smaller chucks and thus of less risk. Not only that, in solving your deployment problems and essentially continuously practicing them you minimise the risk of delivering to production. The result is happy consumers…

    And guess what…

    Just 3 months after RTM and barely 6 weeks after the Visual Studio 2012 launch the first quarterly update, [Visual Studio 2012 Update 1](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/11/26/visual-studio-2012-update-1-is-available.aspx), became available and planning for Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 started.

    And that is not even the end of the story, with the launch of [Visual Studio Team Foundation Service](http://tfs.visualstudio.com/) the Team Foundation Server team, arguably responsible for the most complex component of Visual Studio are delivering even more frequently. They are effectively on a 3 week Sprint cycle and are delivering new features to production to goodness knows how many instances in the cloud every three weeks as well as hotfixes every Monday if needed. This is the new normal…

    And not only is this a Visual Studio thing; [Apollo Plus](http://www.zdnet.com/apollo-plus-is-this-microsofts-first-windows-phone-8-update-7000007926/) (Windows Phone 8 Update 1) is due almost exactly 3 months after the RTM of Windows Phone 8.

    I for one have high hopes of new features for all of Microsoft's products every quarter but some products have more technical debt to pay of than others…

    I have recently been playing a lot with the new Office 2013 release and part of that is Project Server 2013. With the new Project Server Extensions being an integral part of any enterprise Team Foundation Server deployment I thought that I should kick the tires.

    Update - I have figured out my blocking issue and resolved it. See [Project Server 2013 Issue – TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-server-2013-issue-tf294012-cannot-access-the-following-enterprise-project/ "Project Server 2013 Issue – TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project")

    I usually have a complete abhorrence of Project Server that is born of its constant misuse. Project Server is first and foremost an **_earned value_** management system, although many people try to use it to facilitate micro-management or to do time tracking. Neither of these things are a good idea regardless of tool and time tracking while loosely supported by Project Server 2013 is not meant to be done there. Don’t get me wrong, there value in time tracking; How else might you amortise or capitalise your development costs? But you do not however need to account explicitly for every hour nor use it to punish employees for not logging enough hours…

    Anyway.. There are a bunch of thing that need to happen in order to get Project Server 2013 up and running, first of which is actually installing SQL, TFS and SharePoint which I will just link to and get on with the real meat:

    1. [Installing TFS 2012 on Server 2012 with SQL 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-on-server-2012-with-sql-2012/)
    2. [Integrate SharePoint 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/integrate-sharepoint-2013-with-team-foundation-server-2012/)
    3. DONE – Install, configure & configure Project Server 2013
    4. DONE – Set-up Project Server 2013
    5. DONE - Install Team Foundation Server 2012 Project Server Extensions
    6. DONE - Integrate Project Server 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012

    I found the MSDN documentation for installing and configuring Project Server 2013 totally cryptic and I ended up with so many read hearings and dead ends that I had to just figure it out for myself. This is the result of me poking at Project Server 2013 until I got a stable instance which I then blew away to repeat here ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-24-24.png) 
    { .post-img }

    ### Install Project Server 2013

    Just like with SharePoint 2013 you have three stages to the process. Install, Configuration and Configuration… What? Yea, In know… don't ask…

    I am going to lump the first two items together and they are the only two bits that need to be done on every front end server in your farm. They install and prep your SharePoint 2013 servers for creating your first Project Server Portal which is done one or more times through the SharePoint 2013 Administration Portal.

    ![Figure: The Project Server 2013 installation wizard looks just like SharePoint 2013](images/image29-4-4.png "Figure: The Project Server 2013 installation wizard looks just like SharePoint 2013")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The Project Server 2013 installation wizard looks just like SharePoint 2013**

    You will have deja vu when you see the install as it follows the SharePoint 2013 pattern. make sure that you install the prerequisites first to have an easy time.

    ![image3](images/image31-6-6.png "image3")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Install the Prerequisites for Project Server 2013 using the built in tool**

    Some of the prerequisites for Project Server 2013 are the same as the SharePoint 2013 ones so the checks and installs are few and far between:

    - Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
    - Windows Management Framework 3.0
    - Application Server Role, Web Server (IIS) Role
    - Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Native Client
    - Microsoft Sync Framework Runtime v1.0 SP1 (x64
    - Windows Server AppFabric
    - Microsoft Identity Extensions
    - **Microsoft Information Protection and Control Client**
    - Microsoft WCF Data Services 5.0
    - **Cumulative Update Package 1 for Microsoft AppFabric 1.1 for Windows Server (KB2671763)**

    There were only a couple of installs that I have highlighted above.

    ![image18](images/image181-1-1.png "image18")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Run the Configuration Wizard to complete the installation of Project Server 2013**

    With the first step complete we can now run the first configuration that will integrate the bits that we just installed into SharePoint and make sure that SharePoint at least accepts them.

    ![image24](images/image241-2-2.png "image24")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Limited configuration for Project Server 2013**

    We are really just running the exact same SharePoint wizard, but with an additional step.

    ![image27](images/image271-3-3.png "image27")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The 10 step configuration process for SharePoint & Project Server 2013**

    When we ran the SharePoint 2013 configuration when we only had SharePoint installed we only had 9 steps, now we have 10… some secret sauce…

    And that is the per-server configuration complete.. on to the SharePoint configuration…

    ![image33](images/image33-8-8.png "image33")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The other configuration wizard for SharePoint & Project Server 2013**

    Now we can move onto the configuring the services that run inside of SharePoint. This config only needs to be run once per farm.

    ![image39](images/image39-14-14.png "image39")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adding Project Application Services for SharePoint 2013**

    I have no idea what this step does except that at the end of this one you get about 20 more databases in your SQL Server. This time however I am only expecting the one new Project Server databases and configuration to be added.

    ### Set-up Project Server 2013

    Phew.. so that means that we can get down and dirty with Project Server 2013 now? Well… no… not yet. We need to configure a couple of the things that we have just provisioned so head on over to the SharePoint Administration page.

    ![image](images/image30-5-5.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Manage service applications for SharePoint 2013**

    Head on over to “Application Management | Manage service applications” to see a list of all of the “Applications” that are available as part of the core SharePoint 2013 deliverable.

    ![image](images/image32-7-7.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configure the Project Server Service Application**

    We have just added one called “Project Server Service Application” and that is where we are going now.

    [**![image](images/image34-9-9.png "image")**](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/11/image9.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Create Project Web App Instance**

    Now that we are deep in the darkest depths of SharePoint we can create a new Project Web App instance. This will essentially create a new site that will be an instance of the Project Server 2013 UI application that lets us look inside of the project server data.

    ![image](images/image35-10-10.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Defaults for Create Project Web App Instance in Project Server 2013**

    I am just taking the defaults here, but it is effectively saying that I want to create a new site called “PWA” under the default portal and where I what the database to go and what it should be called. As with all sites you can set quotas at this point, but I don’t need to on a demo box.

    ![image](images/image36-11-11.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    Figure:

    Once you click OK you will go back the  provisioning page where you can monitor the background process that is doing a bunch of goodness knows what behind the scenes. It takes a few minutes but goes through:

    1. Waiting for Resources
    2. Creating Project Web App Site
    3. Provisioning Database
    4. Configuring the new Project Web App Site
    5. Provisioned

    ![image](images/image37-12-12.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You can mange the sire that you created for your Project Server 2013 instance**

    You can get into the individual Project Web App configuration and settings by selecting the drop-down and hitting the “Mange” option.

    ![image](images/image38-13-13.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Operational Policies, Queue and Workflow settings for Project Server 2013**

    I am not really interested in tinkering with these options, but I am sure that in a production / live deployment I would need to tweak some mystery undocumented setting to make things shine ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-24-24.png)
    { .post-img }

    Let visit our new portal…

    ![image](images/image40-15-15.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Project Server 2013 portal homepage in SharePoint 2013**

    I am sure that I will be back to set something up later, but just look at that modern goodness…

    ![image](images/image41-16-16.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Setting up your first Project in Project Server 2013**

    Done – We have successfully installed, configured, configured, deployed and provisioned our first SharePoint 2013 portal for Project Server 2013… now for TFS…

    ### Install Team Foundation Server 2012 Project Server Extensions

    Now that we have Project Server 2013 all set-up we can look to getting it integrated with Team Foundation Server. In order to achieve that we need to both install and configure some extensions. These extensions are similar to the SharePoint Extensions for Team Foundation Server 2012 and need to be installed on all of the front end servers in your SharePoint farm that is supporting Project Server 2012.

    ![image](images/image42-17-17.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The Project Server Extensions are on the TFS 2012 ISO**

    On the Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server ISO there is a folder that contains the goodies that we are looking for.

    ![image](images/image43-18-18.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Project Server Extensions for Team Foundation Server 2012**

    Well that was easy… the install detects Project Server 2013 and completes without any hassle.

    ### Integrate Project Server 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012

    We now need to [Enable Data Flow Between Team Foundation Server and Microsoft Project Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg455680.aspx) and effectively plug the correct part of our TFS Team Project into the correct Project in Project Server.

    There are five mini tasks that we needs to perform to get the data flowing:

    1. Register an instance of PWA
    2. Map the PWA instance with a team project collection
    3. Upload default field mappings
    4. Associate an enterprise project plan with a team project
    5. Add team members to the enterprise resource pool

    The first three are easy as I have everything ready…

    ```
    TfsAdmin ProjectServer /RegisterPWA /pwa:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA /tfs:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc:8080/tfs/
    TfsAdmin ProjectServer /MapPWAToCollection /pwa:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA /collection:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc:8080/tfs/tfs01
    TfsAdmin ProjectServer /UploadFieldMappings /collection:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc:8080/tfs/tfs01 /useDefaultFieldMappings

    ```

    **Figure: Register, map to collection and load mappings**

    The next has some prerequisites. I need a Team Project and a Project Plan in Project Server 2013.

    ![image](images/image44-19-19.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Create an Enterprise Project Plan to start us off**

    Create the Enterprise Project Plan, give it a name and same it to start the process.

    ![image](images/image45-20-20.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I now have a MyFirstEP in Project Server 2013**

    With that new Enterprise Project Plan created I now need to create a Team Project in Team Foundation Server to map it to.

    ![image](images/image46-21-21.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Creating MyFirstTP is just as easy in Team Foundation Server 2012**

    Now all we need to do is take both the names and stick them together with the key Work Item Types that will be managed. In the case of the Visual Studio Scrum template it would be the Product Backlog Item, Task & Bug.

    Why Bug you might ask… well the Product Owners are going to be ordering Bugs along with PBI’s to reflect what needs to be done so they should be part of the rollup. Even if you are not pushing these Bugs to Project Server you do need the system to roll up any sub data. For other Process Template and for custom ones check the “Requirements Category” and the “Task Category” in the categories XML file for the full lists.

    ```
    TfsAdmin ProjectServer  /MapPlanToTeamProject
                            /collection:http://win-eo45n4fnsoc:8080/tfs/tfs01/
                            /enterpriseproject:MyFirstEP
                            /teamproject:MyFirstTP
                            /workitemtypes:"Product Backlog Item,Bug,Task"

    ```

    **Figure: Wire up the two containers**

    Now you don’t need to run these commands against the TFS Server from the server itself. In fact if, like me, you never install Visual Studio or even Team Explorer onto your TFS server then you will need a client box to do this from.

    ![image](images/image47-22-22.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The TfsAdmin command has the magic sauce**

    In running those commands I ran into a little fun. After all this is the crescendo to all that we have been set to and where else would murphy strike if here! So I dutifully got the trunsion out to sort out both Project Server and TFS:

    - [Project Server 2013 Issue – TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-server-2013-issue-tf294003-cannot-access-the-following-pwa-instance/)
    - [Project Server 2013 Issue – TF294026: The following work item field does not exist](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-server-2013-issue-tf294026-the-following-work-item-field-does-not-exist/)

    Running the last command.. the one to match up the Team Project with the Enterprise Project plan I ran into an error that I have not yet been able to fix.

    > TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project: MyFirstEP. Verify that the project exists, has been published and that the necessary permissions have been granted to the service account for the team project collection to access the project.

    This completely blocked me for a while as the documentation is rather confusing and the defaults in Project Server 2013 mean that the options that you require do not even exist and you need to change the Project Server security model for it to work.

    - [Project Server 2013 Issue – TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-server-2013-issue-tf294012-cannot-access-the-following-enterprise-project/)

    ### Conclusion

    Just because I am blocked on my test environment does not mean that while not encompassing all of the options this should give you a start into creating Enterprise Project Plans in Project Server 2013 and syncing data between it and Team Projects in Team Foundation Server 2012.

    It is not the easiest thing in the world to integrate Project Server 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012 but the benefits, when coupled with solid agile processes can be powerful. Leaving the Tasks to the Development Team and the low level PBI’s to the Product Owner and concentrating on organising and ordering the big rocks can be hard for many PMO offices that are use to task down management, but it is necessary.

    When you try to call the binding command to map a Team Project Collection in Team Foundation Server 2012 to a Project Server 2013 Web Instance you can get a “TF294003” error.

    [![ TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance](images/image_thumb21-1-1.png " TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/11/image21.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance**

    You get:

    > TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance: [http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA](http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA "http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA") Project Server returned this error: "The request failed with HTTP status 401: Unauthorized.". Verify that the PWA instance exists, and that the necessary permissions have been granted to the service account for the team project collection to access the PWA

    ### Applies to

    - Project Server 2013
    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - Project Server Extensions for Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    If you have followed all of the directions in [Assign Permissions to Support Integration of Project Server and Team Foundation Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412653.aspx#GrantTFSPermissions) but but you are still having issues you should check:

    - [TF294003: Cannot access the following PWA instance](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsprojectsrvint/thread/254feac8-806e-4677-9784-3e5df31f4f44/)

    After consulting with that and many other sites I went spelunking on the servers and following all of the leads in the aforementioned sites. As it turns out I installed Team Foundation Server 2012 with the default options and this resulted in TFS running under the “NT AuthorityLocal Service” which does not have permission to SharePoint.

    I was concentrating so much on making sure that the “BUILTINAdministrator” account, that I am using for everything else, has permission that I missed the account that TFS was using.

    ### Solution

    In this case it was simple to change the service account for Team Foundation Server to be the “BUILTINAdministrator” account instead of the “NT AuthorityLocal Service”.

    **Figure: Changing the TFS Account is easy**

    As I change the account TFS will nicely go off and update everything else for me. Including the Farm Administrators group.

    **Figure: Updating the TFS Service Account everywhere**

    This got me to thinking that is I changes it back to “NT AuthorityLocal Service” it would do the same, and sure enough…

    **Figure: Local Service is now a Farm Administrator**

    I can almost hear generations of SharePoint administrator rolling over in their graves at this, but this is a demo box that I am using to prove out the technology and not a production setup ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-7-7.png). You should always use a different Domain Account for every individual service in both TFS and SharePoint if it were…

    When you try to map an individual Enterprise Project to a specific Team Project you get a TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project error that you can’t resolve.

    ![TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project](images/image48-1-1.png "TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project**

    With the message:

    > _TF294012: Cannot access the following enterprise project: MyFirstEP. Verify that the project exists, has been published and that the necessary permissions have been granted to the service account for the team project collection to access the project._

    Following the documentation does not help.

    ### Applies to

    - Project Server 2013
    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - Project Server Extensions for Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    If you look at the documentation you will see an instruction over and over again that will frustrate the hell out of you!

    > _From the home page for PWA, in the Quick Launch area, click Server Settings._

    But no matter how much you look you cant find “Server Settings”.

    ![So where is that Server Settings on the Quick Launch in Project Server 2013](images/image49-2-2.png "So where is that Server Settings on the Quick Launch in Project Server 2013")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: So where is that Server Settings on the Quick Launch in Project Server 2013**

    You expect it to be in the Quick Launch as noted, but it is devoid of anything that looks like “Server Settings”. So in your despair you start hunting for any sort of settings and combing through every piece of text and hover that you can find.

    ![Oh..Oh.. “PWA Settings” in Project Server 2013](images/image50-3-3.png "Oh..Oh.. “PWA Settings” in Project Server 2013")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Oh..Oh.. “PWA Settings”?**

    But no… not there… I don't see the required “Manage Categories” or “Manage Users” options.

    ![There is always Site Setting in SharePoint 2013](images/image51-4-4.png "There is always Site Setting in SharePoint 2013")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: There is always Site Setting in SharePoint 2013**

    But no… not there either… I still don't see the required “Manage Categories” or “Manage Users” options.

    After some moping around and a little self mutilation I finally got a hold of a working Project Server 2010 instance and stole the URL to the Manage Groups page.

    - [http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA/\_layouts/15/pwa/admin/ManageGroups.aspx](http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA/_layouts/15/pwa/admin/ManageGroups.aspx "http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA/_layouts/15/pwa/admin/ManageGroups.aspx")

    So if you add “/PWA/\_layouts/15/pwa/admin/ManageGroups.aspx” to the URL and hit it we get…

    ![This page is not available when Project Web App is operating in SharePoint permission mode](images/image52-5-5.png "This page is not available when Project Web App is operating in SharePoint permission mode")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: This page is not available when Project Web App is operating in SharePoint permission mode**

    Now I have something to look for!

    So I looked through all of the instructions for  [Enable Data Flow Between Team Foundation Server and Microsoft Project Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg455680.aspx) and could not find any information on the Permissions ![Sad smile](images/wlEmoticon-sadsmile-10-10.png)
    { .post-img }

    But it does look like there are two permission modes that you have to choose between when you create your Collection and I must have chosen “SharePoint Permission Management” when I needed “Classic Permission Management”.

    Now why did I not know that ![Disappointed smile](images/wlEmoticon-disappointedsmile-9-9.png)
    { .post-img }

    ### Solution – Switch to SharePoint Permission Management

    You can switch the permissions at the Project Server level but there are warnings all over the place that this will delete all permissions and you would need to build them manually ![Surprised smile](images/wlEmoticon-surprisedsmile-11-11.png).
    { .post-img }

    - [Change permission management in Project Web App for Project Online](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-project-online-help/change-permission-management-in-project-web-app-for-project-online-HA103433509.aspx)
    - [SharePoint Permissions Mode default permissions for Project Server 2013 SharePoint groups](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219510(v=office.15).aspx>)
    - [Plan user access in Project Server 2013](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161361(v=office.15).aspx>)
    - [Set-SPProjectPermissionMode](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219486(v=office.15).aspx>)

    So lets bite the bullet now before we get any users on there!

    You need to follow the documentation to switch to Project Server mode so that TFS will work with it. The SharePoint mode is new for Project Server 2013 and I do not think that the Project Server Extensions for Team Foundation Server 2013 currently work with it.

    ```
    Set-SPPRojectPermissionMode –Url http://win-eo45n4fnsoc/PWA/
                                -AdministratorAccount win-eo45n4fnsocadministrator
                                -Mode ProjectServer

    ```

    **Figure: Execute some PowerShell to make the switch**

    And that should be it…

    ![image](images/image53-6-6.png "image")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Now running Project Web Access in Project Server Permission mode**

    Lets check the UI…

    ![Now I get Manage Users and Manage Groups for Project Server 2013](images/image54-7-7.png "Now I get Manage Users and Manage Groups for Project Server 2013")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Now I get Manage Users and Manage Groups for Project Server 2013**

    I hope this helps you solve your problem, but remember that mine are very specific and this solution may not fit your problem…

    When you try to upload the default field mappings for Project Server 2013 integration with Team Foundation Server 2012 you can encounter a TF294026: The following work item field does not exist error.

    [![TF294026: The following work item field does not exist](images/image_thumb26-1-1.png "TF294026: The following work item field does not exist")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/11/image26.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF294026: The following work item field does not exist**

    With the message:

    > _TF294026: The following work item field does not exist: Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.CompletedWork. Contact your administrator for Team Foundation Server to add this work item field._

    You are unable to continue without fixing…

    ### Applies to

    - Project Server 2013
    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - Project Server Extensions for Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    Project Server requires that you have data for Remaining Work, Completed Work and Original Estimate for it to function correctly.

    [![The Task Work Item Type only includes Remaining Work](images/image_thumb27-2-2.png "The Task Work Item Type only includes Remaining Work")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/11/image27.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The Task Work Item Type only includes Remaining Work**

    The Visual Studio Scrum Process Template however does not include these as they are not required for Scrum.

    ### Solution

    Use the instructions on [Required Changes to Make When Mapping to a Team Project That Was Created From the Scrum Process Template](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412658.aspx#scrummodifications) to update the Task Work Item Type for the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 template to add both the Completed Work and Original Estimate fields.

    Warning The documentation on MSDN is currently out of date and misses two fields that need to be added. Make sure that you also add the Start and End dates.

    ```
       The number of units of work that have been spent on this task


       Initial value for Remaining Work - set once, when work begins.




    ```

    **Figure: Add both Original Estimate and Completed Work**

    Although we are adding these fields to the Task type we are not necessarily adding them to the UI for users to fill out. We can leave them available for Project Server, while out Team Members of a Scrum Team would be blissfully ignorant of their existence.

    Professional Scrum Foundations is my favourite course to teach as it balances fun and learning with practical experience.The [Professional Scrum Foundations](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/) course is from [Scrum.org](http://scrum.org) and, over two days covers all of the core concepts of Scrum.

    With the core learning objective being Self-Organisation, the course is broken into 4 sprints with respective lecture. But the value is in the order, the sprints always come first. Remember that this course is not just for coders, or even the Development Team. It is the venue for all of the people in your organisation, no mater where they are or what they do, that are involved in ay way, no mater how loosely , with the software development and delivery cycle to get a taste of what might be required of them for the process to be successful.

    When I ran the [Professional Scrum Foundations in Salt Lake City, Utah](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/professional-scrum-foundations-in-salt-lake-city-utah/) I had everyone from the CIO to the Development Team through to the Stakeholder that would be providing feedback. You need all of these folks involved to be successful…

    ### Team Identity in Professional Scrum Foundations

    For most Scrum based courses I always see students broken down into smaller teams that are designed to work together and this is no exception. I had 16 students and I ended up with:

    - Bengal Cats
    - Lamas
    - Giraffe Dinosaur
    - Stupid Monkey

    While these teams seam silly they are meaningful to creating a “team” mentality. Think of the game of Rugby where the team needs to work together to do battle for possession of the ball…

    ![The battle for possession of the ball](images/Scrum-1-2-2.jpg "The battle for possession of the ball")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The battle for possession of the ball**

    …And then once they obtain possession to move as one up the field to gain ground until the next Scrum. The Rugby Scrum and ceremony of the same name in the process perform the same function and is the inspect and adapt for the team to figure out how to move as one to the goal based on what they have currently achieved.

    We need well practiced, tight nit teams to be able to do this…

    ### Team Stupid Monkey

    Once the teams are formed there is always the obligatory  “What do you want to learn”. To be honest it is always the same at the start of the course and really services and an ice cutter or conversation starter.

    ![WP_000009 (2)](images/WP_000009-2-5-5.jpg "WP_000009 (2)")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Stupid Monkey’s What we want to learn list**

    The beauty of the Professional Scrum Foundations course is that everything is the other way around from what the attendees are expecting. Remember this is a practical course designed to invoke both mussel memory for the process and instil unto the team a “We can do this” mentality that no amount of lecture can.

    To achieve this we need to get them actually building software, yes building software during the two day course ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-3-3.png), remember this is not a theory course…
    { .post-img }

    ### Sprint 1 – Yes, ship in 30 minutes!

    All software projects start with Sprint 1 and all Sprint 1’s should deliver some amount of working software.

    ![Sprint 1 in the Professional Scrum Foundations course](images/WP_000006-2-4-4.jpg "Sprint 1 in the Professional Scrum Foundations course")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Sprint 1 in the Professional Scrum Foundations course**

    I usually just throw the teams into building their first increment right of the bat and see how they do with little or no direction ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-3-3.png) I know… meanie… but it does show something... it shows that you can indeed build software with little or no direction except for a list of wants and needs of users. It is that easy….
    { .post-img }

    …Do you build good software? No, of course not, but you are able to get started and show stakeholders and users that you are indeed able to deliver. You build that trust sprint on sprint with early feedback and the most relevant software for your users will emerge from your backlog into your software.

    I have never had even a single team fail to deliver in Sprint 1 but some deliver more and other less… it is about the learning, not just the doing and after Sprint 1 we delve into the wonderful world of the Scrum framework, as well as the Roles, Artefacts and Events that are part of that framework.

    ### Sprint 2 – Now I know what I am doing

    Sprint 2 is usually the best Sprint of the Professional Scrum Foundations course. Now that the teams know a little of what is expected of them they start to conform to the framework as a set of scaffolding around which they begin to build their own process for delivering software. This is the main reason that Scrum is not considered a methodology. It does not provide the details on how to achieve the goal, only a core set of guiding rules within which we are reasonably sure we are still heading in the right direction.

    Now teams have built a Scrum Board and are guided, but not instructed, towards using it to control their flow and maintain a running total of the work that is remaining to complete the Sprint. As with production Sprints we do both a Sprint Review and Retrospective.

    The Sprint Review is where we analyse what was completed and how we need to modify the backlog so that it still reflects what we have left to do to achieve the goal/vision. This is the inspect and adapt opportunity for both the Product Owner and to a greater extent the Stakeholders. Yes… Stakeholders should be at the Sprint Review… indeed you should invite everyone and anyone that will fit in the room. This is the last Inspect & Adapt cycle before you move in to the next Sprint and thus the only chance for stakeholders to their feedback head and the backlog re-ordered. Well, until the next sprint…

    ### Sprint 3 – Strategy in addition to structure

    Sprint three is usually where teams suffer. They now know too much and begin to over think things but they will however get over it and it is an excellent learning experience.

    ![Sprint 3 in the Professional Scrum Foundations gets strategy](images/WP_000021-2-7-7.jpg "Sprint 3 in the Professional Scrum Foundations gets strategy")

    **Figure: Sprint 3 in the Professional Scrum Foundations gets strategy**

    After another awesome Sprint we discussed many of the strategies that go into a successful Scrum implementation. It is not enough to follow the framework. Its not enough to add to create your own methods around that framework. You need additional strategies like Planning Poker, Story Points, Emergent Architecture, Test First-Development, Acceptance Test Driven Development & Continuous Delivery all add to your ability to deliver working high quality software in just 30 days. Do you need to do all of them? No, but you do need to adopt the ones that make sense for your company, your environment and your delivery cadence.

    ### Sprint 4 – The curveball

    Hitting sprint 4 we now have a bunch more information on what it is that we need to do to help us deliver software quickly with the desired quality level. Some teams are now leveraging Scrum Masters and Scrum Boards effectively while others are doing Planning Poker. They are starting to identify impediments and find their own solutions for then. Wither it is limited development resources or collaboration impediments or anything else that is preventing the teams from delivering they are solving the problems themselves. Occasionally they ask questions of me, the coach, and occasionally I even answer them.

    ![The final Sprint of the Professional Scrum Foundations](images/WP_000022-2-8-8.jpg "The final Sprint of the Professional Scrum Foundations")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The final Sprint of the Professional Scrum Foundations**

    We then head into the world of how to get started with this Scrum thing and how to maintain it going forward. How do we prevent ourselves falling back into old habits? How do we identify the things that we need to do to change effectively?

    ### Conclusion

    The actionable backlog is the single most valuable output from the course. With the requirements fresh in their mind and a fresh understanding of what the impediments are going to be the teams create actionable things that need to be done in order to implement Scrum in their organisation.

    - Executive sponsorship of new process needs to be clear to everyone
    - Select a Project for pilot Scrum implementation
    - Train Business to break PBI’s down into smaller chunks
    - Create a passion for Unit Testing
    - Clearly define coding standards

    And these are but a few of the items that you may find on this backlog. As long as you take this backlog, which represents the things that your employees see as being required for success, and execute on it then you should have a chance at success.

    Nothing in life is guaranteed…

    Now that SharePoint 2013 is out I want to make sure that I can integrate SharePoint 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012 without any trouble. I and some of my customers have been holding off on deploying SharePoint; waiting for this release.

    I previously posted on [Integrating SharePoint 2010 with Team Foundation Server 2010](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/integrate-sharepoint-2010-with-team-foundation-server-2010/) as it became available after the Team Foundation Server 2010 launch and now we are in the same position for SharePoint 2013. So what do you need to do to configure this integration… well not much. If you get the chance to install SharePoint 2013 first the Team Foundation Server 2012 installer will install and configure everything for you. So the only time you need to do this manually is if you are adding SharePoint 2013 to the mix post deployment.

    - Related [Integrating SharePoint 2010 with Team Foundation Server 2010](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/integrate-sharepoint-2010-with-team-foundation-server-2010/)

    So lets be about it…

    ### Run all Windows Updates before installing SharePoint 2013

    Remember that this box already has [Windows Server 2012, SQL Server 2012 & Team Foundation Server 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-on-server-2012-with-sql-2012/) as I previously posted about and where I found that SharePoint 2010 is not and would never be supported on Windows Server 2012. Now we can have SharePoint…

    Installing updates are the one key step that will prevent tantrums from SharePoint and hair pulling from you. Always, and I do mean always, install of the required updates and ideally the optional ones too. And not just for Windows.

    [![Run all Microsoft & Windows Updates before installing SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb20-1-1.png "Run all Microsoft & Windows Updates before installing SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image46.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Run all Microsoft & Windows Updates before installing SharePoint 2013**

    Make sure that you are using “Microsoft Update” so that you get updates for other Microsoft products as well. Otherwise it will miss that Visual Studio or SQL Server service pack that you need. This may take a while, so get a cup of tea.

    Note: I follow Microsoft internal policy and have all updates automatically installed at 3am with an auto-reboot. It just gets things done and no one forgets.

    ### Install SharePoint 2013

    They have really slicked up the installation process for SharePoint, but you may open the ISO and think that running setup would be a good idea! You would be wrong…

    [![Don’t run setup for SharePoint 2013 from the ISO](images/image_thumb21-2-2.png "Don’t run setup for SharePoint 2013 from the ISO")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image47.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Don’t run setup for SharePoint 2013 from the ISO**

    Instead use the auto-run that comes from running the CD directly, or you can just run the “prerequisiteinstaller” from the root first.

    [![Install the prerequisite for SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb22-3-3.png "Install the prerequisite for SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image48.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Install the prerequisite for SharePoint 2013**

    Once the prerequisites are complete you can start the installation proper and enter your key and accept the licence agreement. That's the simple stuff, now for the hard questions….

    [![A complete install is the only option for SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb23-4-4.png "A complete install is the only option for SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image49.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: A complete install is the only option for SharePoint 2013**

    This is really the make or break fork… if you get this wrong you will be next completing an uninstall to pick the right option. See the red above? Avoid express at all costs and in this case we already have Team Foundation Server 2012 installed and  we already have SQL Server 2012 installed.

    [![Run the Configuration Wizard for SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb24-5-5.png "Run the Configuration Wizard for SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image50.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Run the Configuration Wizard for SharePoint 2013**

    The configuration wizard will lead you through the custom config but if like me you are running on a local computer with no domain, like me, then you will have to run a command line to generate the database before you proceed. Follow [Issue SharePoint 2013: The username is invalid. The account must be a valid domain account](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/issue-sharepoint-2013-the-username-is-invalid-the-account-must-be-a-valid-domain-account/) and you will be up and running in no time.

    [![Do not disconnect from the SharePoint 2013 farm](images/image_thumb25-6-6.png "Do not disconnect from the SharePoint 2013 farm")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image51.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Do not disconnect from the SharePoint 2013 farm**

    Now that we have a farm we can complete the configuration. Just work though the wizard as you please, although you are on your own if you select kerberos… you know who you are…

    SharePoint 2013 will then run though its 9 configuration steps and give you a functional, but blank SharePoint environment. At the end you get a simple Finish button and some instructions that you need to follow for getting your site to render in a browser.

    Note: SharePoint now works just fine in Chrome and other non Microsoft browsers… woot!

    Now that we have configured SharePoint 2013 we need to…erm… configure it? Again?

    [![image](images/image_thumb26-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image52.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Yes please don’t make me configure everything myself!**

    At this point you get circa 20 services that you can chose to install or not. If you leave them all ticked then you will get about 10 new databases in SQL, but I always do leave them checked… Call me lazy but its too hard to figure out what the dependencies are and what you need and I really don’t want to configure anything later…if this was an enterprise deployment I would take more care but…

    > Can we please get a better description for the services? Maybe with a nice link to what they are, what you get and what you don’t if you choose not to install/configure it. A description of “Performs automated machine translation” is just not good enough for the “Machine Translation Service”. WTF!  
    > **\-Suggestion to SharePoint Product Team**

    One you have chosen your fate you need to wait again while a little spinner does a little dance for you… no really… they are “Working on it…” and it “Shouldn’t take long” at all…

    …mmm tea….

    [![Phooey… Errors in my SharePoint 2013 farm](images/image_thumb27-8-8.png "Phooey… Errors in my SharePoint 2013 farm")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image53.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Phooey… Errors in my SharePoint 2013 farm**

    If you are unlucky like me you may have some errors to deal with, but for me, I forced a non domain account so I am only mildly irritated…and to be honest… I don’t really care for the purpose I am here for… I less I get more kablouie’s…

    [![Configure a root site and you are done](images/image_thumb28-9-9.png "Configure a root site and you are done")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image54.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configure a root site and you are done**

    At this point we can view our root site, but that is about it.

    [![New SharePoint 2013 Team Site](images/image_thumb29-10-10.png "New SharePoint 2013 Team Site")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image55.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: New SharePoint 2013 Team Site**

    And a nice site it is… but that's for another day..

    ### Configure Extensions for SharePoint Products

    Now that we have SharePoint 2013 all configured we need to do two things. The first is to install and configure the Extensions for SharePoint Products so that SharePoint 2013 knows all about TFS 2012. If you have installed SharePoint on a separate server you will need to install the “Extensions for SharePoint Products” that are on the Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server ISO, but if you have a single server environment like me it is all already there.

    [![Configure Extensions for SharePoint Products](images/image_thumb30-11-11.png "Configure Extensions for SharePoint Products")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image56.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configure Extensions for SharePoint Products**

    Lets first launch the wizard and walk through the process.

    [![SharePoint Extensions Configuration Wizard](images/image_thumb31-12-12.png "SharePoint Extensions Configuration Wizard")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image57.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: SharePoint Extensions Configuration Wizard**

    The wizard will lead you through the complicated and arduous list of steps… um… oh… only one step then ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-26-26.png)
    { .post-img }

    [![image](images/image_thumb32-13-13.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image58.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Oh FFS a TF255466. I require a reboot**

    I will be right back…

    [![If the verification of the SharePoint configuration passes then configuration should work](images/image_thumb33-14-14.png "If the verification of the SharePoint configuration passes then configuration should work")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image59.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: If the verification of the SharePoint configuration passes then configuration should work**

    Now the extending and configuring processes can be long and will add solution into SharePoint. We already have the API’s for TFS by virtue of the install, but now we have the custom site and bits we need.

    There will be a site template added but as it will likely look… well… nasty in the nice new SharePoint 2013 interface we will need to create the site manually.

    [![Configuration completed successfully](images/image_thumb34-15-15.png "Configuration completed successfully")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image60.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configuration completed successfully**

    Now that the SharePoint bits have been setup we will have a default link setup between SharePoint and Team Foundation Server. Although if we had a separate Team Foundation Server instance we would need to tell it where the TFS server is.

    Note: You will also require to install the Extensions for SharePoint Products on every front end server for your SharePoint farm.

    [![Default mapping has been configured](images/image_thumb35-16-16.png "Default mapping has been configured")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image61.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Default mapping has been configured**

    ### Configure SharePoint Web Applications in Team Foundation Server 2012

    Now we have installed and configured the bits for SharePoint as well as telling it where the TFS server is we now need to tell TFS where to go.

    Again… as this is a single server this has been done for you (I love the TFS Product Team).

    [![image](images/image_thumb36-17-17.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image62.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configure SharePoint Web Applications**

    You may have noticed that there is no account listed as an administrator! As I am lazy and I am using the BuiltinAdministrator user as both the TFS Service Account and the SharePoint Farm Admin you don’t need one.

    And that's almost us done! But not quite complete… SharePoint knows all bout TFS and TFS now knows all about SharePoint so we can now create some sites…

    ### Configure Collection Site

    In order to have different sites for different collection and enable the ability to have the same Team Project name in multiple collection then you need to create a root collection site under the main site. Some folks like to create this at the ^/sites/\[collection\] level, but I always create the collection site as a sub site of the root. This have the benefit of creating automatic navigation between the sites…

    [![Configure the TFS Collection default SharePoint site](images/image_thumb37-18-18.png "Configure the TFS Collection default SharePoint site")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image63.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Configure the TFS Collection default SharePoint site**

    This is also the final test as when you click OK the Admin Console will go off and try to hook into, or create a site for us. if you do want to have a greater degree of separation between the sites and have them in different collections you can indeed do that as well. You may want to do that if you are planning to separate collection to multiple environments, but I can think of very few reasons that you would want to do that.

    ### Create a new Team Project Site

    If we create a new team project the template from the Process Template that you selected will be used to create the new site. These templates are designed to work in any version of SharePoint but they may look… well… nasty in 2013.

    [![I have one Team Project called “Demo1”](images/image_thumb38-19-19.png "I have one Team Project called “Demo1”")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image64.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I have one Team Project called “Demo1”**

    This team project was created before there was ever a SharePoint server so it has no portal. Lets go ahead and create one manually.

    They have moved things around a little in SharePoint and we now create new sub sites from the “View Content” menu.

    [![Create new sub site from the Site Content page in SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb39-20-20.png "Create new sub site from the Site Content page in SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image65.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Create new sub site from the Site Content page in SharePoint 2013**

    This, while much more hidden is really not something you do every day. You are much more likely to be adding apps to an existing site so having this more clicks away is not a big deal.

    [![Team Foundation Project Portal for SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb40-21-21.png "Team Foundation Project Portal for SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image66.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Foundation Project Portal for SharePoint 2013**

    When we care the new site we have two options. We can create it using the provided “Team Foundation Project Portal” bit it results in a slightly ugly site, or you can use the default “Team Site” template to get a more native 2013 feel.

    [![The Team Foundation Project Portal is a little empty](images/image_thumb41-22-22.png "The Team Foundation Project Portal is a little empty")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image67.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The Team Foundation Project Portal is a little empty**

    This is due to the features not yet being enables… so head on over to “cog | Site Settings | Site Actions | Manage site features” to enable them.

    You can enable one of:

    - **Agile Dashboards with Excel Reporting** – for the MSF for Agile Software Development 6.x Process Template
    - **CMMI Dashboards with Excel Reports** – for the MSF for CMMI Software Development 6.x Process Template
    - **Scrum Dashboards with Reporting** – for the Visual Studio Scrum 2.xRecommended Process Template

    The one you pick depends on the Process Template that you used to create the Team Project. I will activate the Scrum one as I used the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0Recommended Process Template which I heartily recommend. You will have noticed that here are 2 or 3 for each of the “Agile | SMMI | Scrum” monikers and this is due to the different capabilities that you might have. For example:

    - **Agile Dashboards** – I have TFS with no Reporting Services or Analysis Services
    - **Agile Dashboards with Basic Reporting** – I have Reporting Services and Analysis Services but not SharePoint Enterprise
    - **Agile Dashboards with Excel Reporting** – I have Everything! Reporting Services, Analysis Services and SharePoint Enterprise

    If you enable the highest level of the one you want it will figure out the one that you can run ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-26-26.png) and in this case I can do “Scrum Dashboards with Reporting”.
    { .post-img }

    [![Enabling Scrum Dashboards with Reporting in SharePoint 2013](images/image_thumb42-23-23.png "Enabling Scrum Dashboards with Reporting in SharePoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image68.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Enabling Scrum Dashboards with Reporting in SharePoint 2013**

    The Scrum template does not have any built in Excel Reports, but it does have Reporting Services reports. Now when I return to the homepage I get the same/similar portal you would have seen in SharePoint 2010.

    ### Conclusion

    And that's us done… we have installed and configured SharePoint 2013. We have integrated SharePoint 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012 and we have manually created our Team Project Portal site.

    Note: If you create a new Team Project the SharePoint 2013 portal will be created for you and pre-actived.

    Awesome… go forth and 2013!

    Because of the compatibility with ARM and the new Windows 8 touchscreen experience you would imagine that Office has undergone a rather complete overall and you would be right. With Office 2013 you get a fully touch capable immersive experience that is designed to work well on both the Tablet and the Desktop.

    Indeed Office 2013 is the first and only application that is certified to work on both the ARM desktop & the PC Desktop.

    I have been using the Technology preview for quite some time and I have found it to be both stable and much more useful. You can’t really put you finger on it, it is just… better…

    While not usually though of as part of your Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tooling in any modern application lifecycle it is essential.

    ### New things I like about Office 2013

    Its the little things that I like. All those little touches go to improve the whole like no large features can. I guess they have taken this opportunity to improve some of the underlying engine parts. Like some of the improvements in Windows 8, they are fundamental…

    - **Typing** – There is an awesome thing that happens when you are typing that you only see when you yourself are typing. Watching or explaining does not enable the understanding… only using does…
    - **Less freezing** – While there is still a few areas that suffer from freezing, I am looking at you Outlook, there has been an overall improvement. Almost as if the Office team finally got time to read up on threading and asynchronous programming…

    ### The Install Experience

    If you have Office 2013 Preview you will need to completely uninstall this first. If you “Start | ‘Unin’ | Settings | Uninstall a program” you should be able to put “2013” or “preview” into the search bar and complete the removal. And once you have it removed…

    [![Treated to the Office 2013 into video](images/image_thumb16-1-1.png "Treated to the Office 2013 into video")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image42.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Treated to the Office 2013 into video**

    As usual there are tones of new things that you can do with Office 2013, no least of which is the [ability to log in with your Microsoft ID](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/allow-user-to-change-the-region-for-windows-live-id-billing/) and have all of your SkyDrive data at the tip of your fingers.

    There are no install options and instead after the video you are just “done”. This is fine with me, and I think most people as everyone I know takes the default. Unless you were pushed for space, and lets face it, who is these days, then I just want to install everything anyway.

    [![You are good to go with Office 2013](images/image_thumb17-2-2.png "You are good to go with Office 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image43.png)

    The install is so ridiculously easy that not a single person can get it wrong…

    ### Why PowerPoint 2013 is an ALM tool

    You would not immediately consider PowerPoint 2013 to be an ALM tool, but it is, and a darn good one. You can easily mock up interactions or storyboards and use animations to express to either your Stakeholders or to your Development Team exactly what it is that you are trying to make.

    [![StoryBoarding with PowerPoint 2013](images/image_thumb18-3-3.png "StoryBoarding with PowerPoint 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image44.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Storyboarding with PowerPoint 2013**

    This is an invaluable tool in your arsenal and if you have access to at least the Microsoft Test Professional SKU for Visual Studio 2012 you can access additional tools to help you make your story boards awesome.

    Installing the tools (available in Visual Studio 2012 Test Professional , Visual Studio 2012 Premium and Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate) give you access to many development Storyboarding Shapes and adds the ability to connect your Storyboarding to work items in TFS.

    ### Why Excel 2013 is an ALM tool

    Team Foundation Server seamlessly integrates its operational store with Excel and this is the tool of choice when you are either bulk editing your work items, or if you are creating reports against the Data Warehouse and Cube. While the new web UI in Visual Studio 2012 is awesome, nothing can compete with the graphing, editing, functions and reporting that you can do right out of the box.

    [![Access your TFS operational store from within Excel 2013](images/image_thumb19-4-4.png "Access your TFS operational store from within Excel 2013")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image45.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Access your TFS operational store from within Excel 2013**

    This makes Excel 2013 a premier reporting and data manipulation tool in the ALM space.

    ### Conclusion

    The new Office 2013 gives us the same awesome tool is a slicker faster package and there is no way that I will be complaining about that…

    When you execute a build of a MVC3 or MVC2 project from 2010 in Team Foundation Build 2012 you get an error of “The target ‘CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir’ does not exist in the project”.

    I was working with a customer that upgraded directly from Team Foundation Server 2008 to Team Foundation Server 2012 and that wanted to take advantage of the power of Continuous Integration. However their Solutions and Projects files we upgrades from previous versions of Visual Studio and this caused an interesting issue…

    [![The target “CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir” does not exist in the project](images/image_thumb9-5-5.png "The target “CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir” does not exist in the project")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image35.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The target “CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir” does not exist in the project**

    ### Applies to

    - Team Foundation Build 2012
    - ASP.NET MVC 2
    - ASP.NET MVC 3
    - ASP.NET MVC 3 Update

    ### Findings

    After some time looking into what might be missing from the build server it looks like this is more due to MvcBuildViews conflicting with Web Deploy packaging:

    - [Using MvcBuildViews with One-click Publish and Deployment Packages](http://21below.blogspot.com/2011/03/using-mvcbuildviews-with-one-click.html)
    - [MVC3 project build fails because of web.config in obj folder](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7388359/mvc3-project-build-fails-because-of-web-config-in-obj-folder)
    - [Compiling MVC Views In A Build Environment](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/05/09/compiling-mvc-views-in-a-build-environment.aspx)

    When we first installed the build server we did not add anything other than Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate to allow for building of out of the box applications. However, when we additionally needed to build and MVC3 application that is deployed to Azure we installed those tools and SDK’s using the recommended approach of using the [Web Platform Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx).

    [![Web Platform Installer install updates MVC and removes CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir](images/image_thumb10-1-1.png "Web Platform Installer install updates MVC and removes CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image36.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Web Platform Installer install updates MVC and removes CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir**

    This does however also install the Web Deploy packaging process as a pre-requisite and thus we have a new problem on out build server. Why you might ask?

    Well, it looks like when you wanted to precompile your Views with MVC2 and you enabled “MvcBuildViews” you also had to add a “DependsOnTargets” attribute with “CleanWorkspacePackage; CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir; CleanWebsitesTranformParametersFiles;” to make it all work.

    This was fixed by an update to MVC3 that even removed the targets. Hence the error… bummer…

    So it looks like the CleanWorkspacePackage, CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir and CleanWebsitesTranformParametersFiles targets have been removed from the newer versions of the web targets file.

    [![At some point someone enabled MvcBuildViews](images/image_thumb15-4-4.png "At some point someone enabled MvcBuildViews")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image41.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: At some point someone enabled MvcBuildViews**

    So at some time in the past we wanted to enable MvcBuildViews and we added the following to our Project file:

    While this worked at the time, it now caused the error that we saw.

    While I initially fixed the issue, see solution below, for the MVC3 Azure build that we were trying to get working, there was a nock on affect on some of the other builds.

    ### Workaround – Uninstall to fix CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir in Team Foundation Build

    You can try to uninstall the things that you added to the build server but this tends to be a red herring and the damage is almost always done when you install SDK’s. In addition you probably added those things for a reason and you probably still have that reason. Short of completely rebuilding the Build Server this almost never works…

    ### Workaround – Use old publish targets to re-enable in Team Foundation Build

    As pointed out by the customer this should really have been the default, but the Azure and MVC teams have taken the approach to implicitly upgrade to the latest targets when they become available. The do however allow you to explicitly use the older targets.

    As I can find no information on this online I will fall back on [Barry Schnell’s](http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryschnell) awesome investigation on the server itself to find out that the new updates created a new build target variable called “UseNewPublishTargets” that defaults to True. When this is set to true the newer version of “microsoft.web.publishing.targets” is used and the build will fail.

    [![Add the “/p:UseNewPublishTargets="false"” MSBuild Argument](images/image_thumb11-2-2.png "Add the “/p:UseNewPublishTargets="false"” MSBuild Argument")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image37.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add the “/p:UseNewPublishTargets="false"” MSBuild Argument**

    You can however set this variable to false by adding “/p:UseNewPublishTargets="false"” to the MSBuild Arguments in the Build Definition on Team Foundation Server.

    ### Solution – Remove target CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir for MSBuild in Team Foundation Build

    It looks like the CleanWorkspacePackage, CleanWorkspacePackageTempDir and CleanWebsitesTranformParametersFiles targets have been removed from the newer versions of the web targets file and we just need to remove them from the Project file.

    [![So we can remove everything in the “DependsOnTargets”](images/image_thumb14-3-3.png "So we can remove everything in the “DependsOnTargets”")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image40.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: So we can remove everything in the “DependsOnTargets”**

    So we can now use the following without the “DependsOnTargets” directive:

    This should solve the problem permanently, but make sure you test your application thoroughly…

    You should use nested PBI’s and never nested Tasks when you are using the Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server Agile Planning Tools and here is why.

    At some point you take your “Product Backlog Item” and break it down into sub items as part of your development process. This is part of the creation of a Plan to complete those Backlog Items and that plan reflects the best guess of the Team in what needs to be done to achieve those backlog items.

    ![In Team Foundation Server you can have nested tasks](images/image30-4-4.png "In Team Foundation Server you can have nested tasks")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: In Team Foundation Server you can have nested tasks**

    In the pursuit of this you may feel that it is a good idea to create nested tasks and using the Work Item Tracking in both Visual Studio and the Web Access you will be able to created these nested tasks.

    ![Agile Planning tools do not support nested tasks the way you think](images/image31-5-5.png "Agile Planning tools do not support nested tasks the way you think")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Agile Planning tools do not support nested tasks the way you think**

    However when you view the Sprint Backlog you don’t see the in-between nested tasks, instead you only see a flat list of tasks.

    ![Agile Boards do not support nested tasks](images/image32-6-6.png "Agile Boards do not support nested tasks")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Agile Boards do not support nested tasks**

    In addition to the Agile Planning tools the Agile Boards also do not show the intermediary nested tasks.

    ### Applies to

    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server
    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server Update 1

    ### Steps to Reproduce

    You can replicate this fairly easily by following these steps to reproduce:

    1.  Add PBI called “PBI 1”
    2.  Add child Task to “PBI 1” called “Task 1”
    3.  Add child Task to “PBI 1” called ‘Task 2”
        ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1.png "clip_image001")
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Result as expected with “Task 1” and “Task 2” visible  
         **
    4.  Add child Task to “Task 2” called “Task 3”
        ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002-2-2.png "clip_image002")
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Not expected to see “Task 1” & “Task 3”**

    ### Findings

    This is essentially us hitting up against the ideals of the tool. While the Work Item Tracking and Query system built into TFS is designed to handle and sort of work style the Agile Planning Tools are optimised to work with… well… and “agile” flow.

    With almost 80% of companies saying that they “do agile” it only makes sense for Microsoft to concentrate on the biggest chunk of customers. If you are not in that 80% then you should take a look at [Requirement management in the modern application lifecycle](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/requirement-management-in-the-modern-application-lifecycle/) for solutions that will fit your needs while still maintaining the data integrity and reporting that is the cornerstone of TFS.

    > _Do, or do not…. there is no try!_  
    > **\-Yoda**

    If however you are really trying this “agile” thing and are running into issues like this with the tool then you may need to change your workflow.

    ### Solution

    If it needs broken down then it is likely not a Task at all, but a Product Backlog Item masquerading as a Task. The best solution is to ask yourself when you are breaking down your “Product Backlog Items” if the unit you are breaking it down into may need broken down further. If it does then it is probably a “Product Backlog Item” and not a Task.

    Now while [stack ranking hierarchical work items](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/you-cant-stack-rank-hierarchical-work-items/ "You can’t stack rank hierarchical work items?") makes life difficult and does lead to the dark side, it is supported by the Agile Planning tools and the Agile Boards.

    ![You can see nested PBI’s on the Agile Planning tools](images/image33-7-7.png "You can see nested PBI’s on the Agile Planning tools")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You can see nested PBI’s on the Agile Planning tools**

    You will find that when you try to drag the parent into a Sprint you will be prevented and you need to drag the individual PBI’s instead.

    [![image](images/image_thumb8-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image34.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You can see correctly the parent is not listed**

    This is the same behaviour as we saw on the tasks, but it now makes sense as we no longer care about delivering the parent PBI.

    If you break down a Product Backlog Item into more granular Product Backlog Items those sub items should reflect the entirety of the work that needs to be done to achieve the parent and thus rendering the parent superfluous for all but upstream reporting. If you break a Product Backlog Item down into Tasks those Tasks should represent the Development Teams best guess at what actions / work needs to be undertaken to complete that Product Backlog Item.

    The new normal for software development is the theme for the keynote at the [Visual Studio Launch Roadshows](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/visual-studio-2012-launch-roadshow-in-san-diego-and-irvine/) that I will be speaking at this week I have been doing a little research.

    It seams that there is, especially in the USA, an imperative to not push a message that you don’t think that the audience is ready for. Indeed I have heard of a few folks doing the keynote and not believing the message themselves. Well, I do and I also firmly believe that there is value in sowing the seeds of knowledge wherever it is lacking regardless of the likelihood of initial acceptance.

    **Figure: The new normal of the modern application lifecycle**

    Where am I going with this? Well, look at the industries efforts to deliver software over the last 60 years. In fact I could be safe in saying that very little software in the last 60 years has been delivered by good process and planning, but instead by herculean efforts of the participants to avoid a death march. What does this tell us about the industry? I think that it tells us that we have our heads dug deep in the sand and are refusing to admit that we suck.

    ### I am doing agile? Really?

    Look at the recent figured quoted by [Ken Schwaber of 80%](http://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/culture-change-a-new-viewpoint/) of companies “doing agile”. Really! There is no way that 80% of organisations are _doing_ agile, maybe they _say_ they are doing it, but there is more to agility than lip service.

    Agile or the permit of agility in your IT organisation is something that is so widely known as imperative to survival that every IT executive worth a paycheck is telling his subordinates that this is what we need. The problem is that there is no strive to commit and achieve true agility and they pay lip service only to the terms and ideals while bastardising and castrating the core concepts making them unworkable for delivering any real value, and then complain when they cant deliver. This is a frustration of all ALM Consultants, Agilest and Process Improvement gurus everywhere.

    But there are companies out there that are actually changing and being hugely successful for it. Look at the changes rattling Microsoft right now with the demise of the Service Pack and the rise of continuous delivery. Indeed if you have to deliver to production every 3 months where as before you only delivered every two years you need to change to do things a little differently.

    - [TFS Shipping Cadence](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/08/28/tfs-shipping-cadence.aspx) by Brian Harry

    ![The main character from Despicable Me gets an idea and utters "Light Bulb"](images/lightbulb1-despicableme1-27-27.jpg "Despicable Me: Light Bulb")Its not just Microsoft that are benefiting for this shift, indeed it is much harder for them than nearly every company on earth as they are a behemoth of and entity. Look at products like Google Chrome that ships continuously to production. I am calling out these apps as they are large applications delivered as thick client apps to local computers that need to work and upgrade seamlessly. Can you do that?
    { .post-img }

    The frustrating thing is that the understanding of what needs to be done to achieve agility is still niche knowledge and for many folks the light bulb has not yet gone on.

    So instead of talking to companies about agile or lean or even Scrum we need to express upon them the understanding of what in now normal for software and IT teams in this brave new world of consumerisation post iPhone and how it will affect them.

    - [Consumerization of IT and My Cup of Coffee](http://blog.nwcadence.com/consumerization-of-it-and-my-cup-of-coffee/) by Lori Borg

    Time for a little truth:

    > If you can’t deliver software to your customers every 30 days today then you will find it increasingly difficult to compete and keep customers engaged. Within 5 years you will either have adapted your development and release processes or you will be at a significant disadvantage (if not out of the business completely).  
    > \-Zephan Schroeder

    We have reached a tipping point of change and your are either in, or you are out, and if you are out, you are done.

    ### The Keynote

    And that is the reasoning behind the keynote, but what of the keynote itself. Well, its a “canned” presentation with a specific message that is designed to wrap the themes of the day but I still need to understand and present the content. What follows is what I can only describe as a record of my though processes and what I hope to say and remember. If you can figure it out it may be useful…

    #### The New Normal

    Its hard to pin down what the new normal is without looking at what normal used to be. Not so long ago if you wanted to type a letter you had to use a typewriter. In fact I learned to type on a typewriter and the keyboard layout  is a direct result of deliberately slowing down the typist so as to not have the letter arms jam.

    Although my first PC was a Pentium 90 with Windows 95, I had a “Commodore 64” and a “BBC B+ Microcomputer” prior to that. I still remember having to open up my BBC to insert a microchip that gave me the awesome power of word processing. And getting that dos game to work properly on my P90 required manually managing the memory (phew.. I am glad we don’t have to do that any more.)

    **Figure: More modern things on the way out**

    There are many more modern things that are either gone, or are on the way out. In the US you can now take a picture of your check to deposit it and If you go to the United Kingdom don’t expect to be writing any checks at all. You can’t pay with them at the store and as banks don’t want to mess around processing them so they charge you extra for having, let alone writing them. You can however transfer money digitally from any account to any other for free.

    Do you have a clock by your bed? I don’t… I use my phone… what about a camera? Phone again… and now your credit and debit cards are about to be replaced by… yes.. again, with your phone.

    **Figure: The only constant is change**

    From the 70’s with the advent of the microprocessor to the 80’s Personal Computers and the graphical-user-interfaces of the 90 we have made computers smaller and smaller. Laptops became not only common but the standard in the business world of the early 00’s where they totally eclipsed PC sales. Not only has the computer changed dramatically, but how we interact with them and what we do with them has changed. We now carry them, talk to them and play with them, oh how the world has changed. What is it that you have in your pocket but a super-computer by all but the most modern standards.

    Other industries are changing along with the computer industry. Look at the way the newspaper, magazine and book industry are struggling to reinvent themselves. Where is Borders? Indeed the TV industry's is still trying to figure out how to compete with Netflix, HULU and Amazon in the aftermath of the ease of peer-to-peer downloads of the last 10 years.

    **Figure: Change is not an option, its a guarantee**

    In this new world of the modern application lifecycle change is normal and we can benefit from it. It happens all of the time and we mustn't be afraid of it.

    ![Your world is changing around you](images/image4-23-23.png "Your world is changing around you")

    **Figure: Your world is changing around you**

    The world is constantly and continuously changing and it is not going to wait for you. Your competitors are not going to stand still either, they are innovating and are you keeping up?

    #### The IT Department in the new normal

    The role and scope of the IT department has also changed dramatically over the years.

    ![IT making all of the key decisions was the new normal](images/image6-24-24.png "IT making all of the key decisions was the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: IT making all of the key decisions was the new normal**

    In the 90’s the IT department was considered a cost centre and a drain on any  company resources. In many organisations, especially large ones, this attitude perused it into the early 00’s where IT was the hub of technical decision making and spent a budget that was allocated to them. They made the technical decisions on behalf of the muggles.

    ![Management owning the technical decisions became the new normal](images/image7-25-25.png "Management owning the technical decisions became the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Management owning the technical decisions became the new normal**

    As we move into the 21st century IT aligned much more closely with their businesses in an effort to reengage and better understand the values of the organisation and deliver on that value. Indeed the technical decision were now driven by management as we saw from the proliferation of the Blackberry throughought the 00’s.

    [![IT driven by customers is the new normal](images/image_thumb1-1-1.png "IT driven by customers is the new normal")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image8.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: IT driven by customers is the new normal**

    More and more organisations are recognising the importance of IT and the software that it delivers to their bottom line. Indeed many organisations are realising that their success is directly attributed to the technology provided by IT and are looking at it more and more as a profit centre rather than the cost centre that they once though it was. Indeed can you name an organisation that could survive without the technology provided by IT?

    #### The developer in this new normal

    Even the developers role has changed over the last 20 years along with the world of every technologist.

    ![The developer evolved into this new normal](images/image9-26-26.png "The developer evolved into this new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The developer evolved into this new normal**

    20 years ago it was the developer that made the technical decisions, designing and building solutions to solve business problems often in isolation. As organisations have matured they have implemented more structure with those same developers beginning to work together with Testers, Infrastructure and business owners to define and deliver the right value.

    Today, developers who want to stay in business find themselves working directly with their customers to deliver that value.

    #### The consumer in the new normal

    What about the consumer, have they changed? They are the ones that are demanding our services and buying our products so they can’t have changed that much can they?

    ![Owning a PC became the new normal](images/image11-8-8.png "Owning a PC became the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Owning a PC became the new normal**

    The 90’s was the time of the rise of the personal computer. By the end of the 90’s more than 51% of households in the US had a personal computer. This was not just the technologists that were buying computers, with over 54 million computers in circulation it was the average person, and this changed the world for ever.

    [![Access to the internet became the new normal](images/image_thumb2-2-2.png "Access to the internet became the new normal")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image12.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Access to the internet became the new normal**

    With access to the internet in the early part of the 21st century becoming commonplace the world seamed to become a much smaller place. The internet brought companies, people and families together and more and more people started shopping online.

    This was the birth of the internet generation and with the internet becoming such a fundamental part of our lives it heralded the beginning of the battle between the consumer and IT.

    ![A mobile phone in every pocket has become the new normal](images/image17-9-9.png "A mobile phone in every pocket has become the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: A mobile phone in every pocket has become the new normal**

    With a mobile device in every pocket the consumer now has the internet in the palm of their hands and are no-longer tethered to the desk. How many times have you won or lost an argument to Wikipedia within seconds. Around 25% of US internet users are mobile-only and there is an expectation that, as happened with laptops in the early 00’s, mobile internet use will eclipse desktop use within the next two years.

    #### Change in the new normal

    Things are a changing.

    ![Everything changed and adaption is key](images/image18-10-10.png "Everything changed and adaption is key")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Everything changed and adaption is key**

    Technology changes, people change and as things change we can either adapt of become a relic of the past…

    [![Can’t see the forest for the trees](images/image_thumb5-4-4.png "Can’t see the forest for the trees")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image15.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Can’t see the forest for the trees**

    IT Organisations are focusing so much on what they are doing and the changes that are impacting them that they are not seeing the driving forces behind the change.

    This mobile movement is a symptom of a greater driving force behind it and it is veiled behind this and similar symptoms. Sometimes people know exactly what they want, and sometimes we have to show them. The problem is that they want access and they want convenience and they want it their way.

    #### The consumerisation of IT

    With the successful proliferation of mobile devices and apps, many of which run in the cloud the consumer is now in the driving seat. In fact for the first time ever the technology and internet speed that consumers have at home far surpasses anything that they have in the office.

    ![The consumerisation of IT](images/image19-11-11.png "The consumerisation of IT")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The consumerisation of IT**

    With I.T. becoming much more accessible, meaningful and relevant to the consumer they are embracing it with gusto. With the technology now in the pockets, hands and purses they are feeling empowered as never before.

    I.T. has now become consumerised!

    ![Who is the consumer of this new normal?](images/image20-13-13.png "Who is the consumer of this new normal?")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Who is the consumer of this new normal?**

    The consumer is not just the customer that buys products or services from us, it is also the employees that work for us and use our line-of-business apps. And the hard truth is that…

    [![How they consume IT has changed their expectations of you](images/image_thumb7-5-5.png "How they consume IT has changed their expectations of you")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image21.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: How they consume IT has changed their expectations of you**

    How they consume IT has changed their expectations of you, forever.

    - [The consumerization of IT- The next-generation CIO](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology-innovation-center/consumerization-information-technology-transforming-cio-role.jhtml)

    This thing that is the consumerisation of IT was a battle waged in secret between the consumer and IT and I am sorry to report that IT lost, completely and dramatically.

    The consumer is now driving the changes in our world and they expect much of technology. They have expectations of reliability, mobility, frequent updates and that they can use their own devices. The vast majority of companies already allow employees to use their personal devices at work and on top of that they expect it all to just work.

    This is the consumerisation of I.T. …

    ![The New Normal](images/image22-14-14.png "The New Normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The New Normal**

    … And this is what we are calling “The New Normal”.

    #### Staying Relevant in the new normal

    In order to be successful you need to remain relevant and in order to stay relevant you need to engage with the consumer in this new normal or you might find your self relegated to obscurity or worse… irrelevance.

    ![Time to reflect & re-evaluate in the new normal](images/image23-15-15.png "Time to reflect & re-evaluate in the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Time to reflect & re-evaluate in the new normal**

    Although you may be in a strong position in your market the good time never last forever. If you loose your edge and don’t reflect and re-evaluate your position you may end up like Kodak or Blockbuster. Irrelevant in your time with new competitors running rings around you.

    You need to look at where you came from, what brought you together in the first place? What was the strength of your people? What were your development practices? What methodologies di you use? What tools?

    What was special about you and the way that you did things that allowed you to get to your current position. Is what you are currently doing good enough for the new normal?

    ![Time to re-invent yourself for the new normal](images/image24-16-16.png "Time to re-invent yourself for the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Time to re-invent yourself for the new normal**

    It is time to get down to some serious corporate evolution and try to keep up with your consumers who are out in front.

    Don’t get left behind…

    ![Adapt your product in the new normal](images/image25-17-17.png "Adapt your product in the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adapt your product in the new normal**

    You need to look at what you do as a business and the purpose of your technologies, your processes and your tools.

    If you are creating software that you sell to consumers your success is directly linked to to how quickly you can respond to the market, the new normal.

    If however you are building line-of-business applications while they may not be directly linked to your profitability, your consumer, your employees can only be as effective as the software that you deliver for them. If they need to respond to the market then you need to support them in that endeavour be delivering value to them as quickly as possible.

    Regardless of who your consumer is the quicker you get value to them the better off your company will be. Your success is about your people, your processes and your tools.

    ![Adapt your people in the new normal](images/image26-18-18.png "Adapt your people in the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adapt your people in the new normal**

    You need your teams and your consumers to work together to make sure that you are delivering the most relevant value to your business and that your ensure that your products align with the company goals.

    You should measure your software teams success in the same way that you measure the success of the consumer, or as close as you can. If you are building software for the public, measure by sales. If you are delivering internally then measure the success of the team by the success of that consumer.

    Your warehouse team has measure they need to meet. Should your software teams building the  inventory control system not be measured in the same way?

    ![Adapt your process in the new normal](images/image27-19-19.png "Adapt your process in the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adapt your process in the new normal**

    Is your software release cycle based on a solar cycle? Are you confident that the software you will be delivering in 6 months time is going to meet the needs of your business in 6 months?

    What do your ALM practices look like?  Can your current ALM practices support the “i want it now” mentality that your consumers are now demanding?

    In the past we focused on each individual task within your application lifecycle, like Source Control or Testing. In the 21st century, better activities and ideals for software development such as Agile, Scrum, XP and Kanban led to an increase of ALM tools to help manage the development cycle as well as helping you build a methodology that works for you.

    In this changing word your software development cycle needs to be much shorter which means you need a greater amount of transparency to ensure adequate quality.

    ![Adapt your tools in the new normal](images/image28-20-20.png "Adapt your tools in the new normal")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adapt your tools in the new normal**

    In order to be successful at building modern applications you need the right tools, the right process and the right platform.

    You must be able to support DevOps to ensure that your systems support it. You must be able to build quality in and not just test it in. You need to be able to work in hybrid environments of on-premises and cloud. And above all you need to be able to support cross-platform which means developing for Windows, Android and IOS.

    Manual Testing in this new age of the modern application lifecycle has taken on new complexities that make it even more difficult to track and identify which tests are passing, which are failing and to which environment that data should be associated.

    - Update 2013-02-19 - Featured in [ALM Mag Vol 1 Issue 2](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2013/02/Hinshelwood-ALMMag-Vol1Issue2.pdf). If you want to subscribe to future editions I have a [discount subscription](http://www.member.almmag.com/sales.php?coupon=foundingmember) that you can use.

    As we move into, or you might already be there, the era of agile and the delivery timetable shrinks to only a few weeks we can no longer do all of our testing in isolation. We need to work with the Engineers, Analysts and Operations on Development Teams and effectively swarm to solve the problems. Wither that problem is adding new features, fixing a bug or deploying to an environment it is now in the scope of all the departments and this new world does not recognise even the idea of the silo.

    [![Manual Test makes sure that we build what we need and no more](images/image_thumb5_thumb1-6-6.png "Manual Test makes sure that we build what we need and no more")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image_thumb52.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Manual Test makes sure that we build what we need and no more**

    It is no longer acceptable to “_test quality In_” as this is far too expensive and we need to move to a model of iteratively “_building quality in_” so that each and every iteration outputs working software that is of releasable quality. The only way to do this is to be able to test, measure and learn with very tight feedback loops…

    ### The Problem

    There are a number of key ailments that when one tries to deliver fully tested software at least every 30 days become  acute problems and blockers. Many teams fail because they do not realise that all of their process will need to change in order to achieve agility of purpose. The three main stumbling blocks are:

    - **Where am I?** – What has been tested and what has not
    - **Actionable Bugs** – Collecting enough information to reproduce
    - **Automation Generation** – Code generation from the recorded data

    This things however are not insurmountable, but do need defined.

    #### Where am I?

    It is hard for testing teams in this new era to even know where they are in the testing cycle. To be honest they found it hard even in the world of linier testing as the shear amount of data collected cam be monstrous. The traditional method would be to have a document that contains the test itself and some sort of spread sheet that allows them to track progress.

    But if you have a multitude of flat data sheets to record your test status it is at most impossible and at least incredibly time consuming to formulate any sort of reporting from the desperate data sources. It is hard enough to know which tester is taking which tests let alone which tests have been run against which version of the software under test. This cam make testing incredibly opaque and more of an art than a science.

    #### Actionable Bugs

    When a bug is found it is eminently more difficult to figure out where it is and what to fix it if you lack even the most basic information on out it came to pass. If we do not have the steps that were followed then reproducing all but the simplest of issues can be impossible resulting in wasted time fro both the developer and the tester as they go back and fourth in a kind of bug ping-pong that gets nothing done.

    Reducing the cycle time of bugs is equally hard and the more information that we have we collect during the lead up to the failure greatly increased the likelihood that we will be able to find and fix the issue.

    #### Automation Generation

    Regardless of finding a test while proving a bug exists or does not, or if that test verifies that a feature now correctly exists if we are to attain agility with quality we need to be able to always run this test. This poses a problem as our tests multiply iteration on iteration and very quickly to a point where we can only pick and choose which tests need to be run.

    To combat this it would be awesome if we could take all of the data collected and generate an automation that can be run time and again to verify that we have not broken anything. This automation needs to be easily regenerated so that we do not spend large amounts of time maintaining it in the scope of a continuously evolving  application.

    Achieving quality product with ought automation generation can make testing very expensive and can even put the road to “testing quality  in” beyond the means of many organisations.

    ### The Integration

    There are a number of points within which you can integrate your tools with Microsoft test Manager and give users a seamless experience across a multitude of technologies.

    [![Microsoft Test Manager Architecture](images/image_thumb38-1-1.png "Microsoft Test Manager Architecture")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image40.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Microsoft Test Manager Architecture**

    These integration points currently cover two areas, collecting data and recording and playback.

    - **Data Collector** – Extending a data recorder
    - **Recorder /Playback** – Extend the recording an playback features
    - **Test Runner** – Building a custom Test Runner

    #### Integration: Data Collector

    Microsoft Test Manager provides a bunch of data collectors out of the box for collecting information to both create actionable bugs and to enable the recording / playback functionality. You can create your own data collectors to capture whatever you want as part of the manual test run. These collectors can run on the client or any of the machines under test via the test agent.

    #### Integration: Recorder / Playback

    Being able to extend the recording / playback functionality means that applications that might traditionally not work with the standard recorder. The standard recorder is based on the same technology that enables a screen reader to work and if those features are not present in the application under test it will fail. To make it work you would need to create an extension that would allow you to for example, testing using Chrome or on a Java application.

    #### Integration: Test Runner

    There may indeed be the need to replicate a subset of or the entire functionality of Microsoft Test Manager in order to run in environments and systems not currently supported by MTM. This can be done using the rich set of API’s that allow you to import test results and interact with any of the Test Case and Test Result data.

    ### The Solutions

    In order for testers to become first class citizens in the Development Team we need to be able to be able to effectively turn the quagmire that is traditional test tracking into a well oiled repeatable machine that takes all of the mundane tasks away from testers and let them concentrate on validating the delivery of value to the customer.

    Microsoft Test Manager provides a framework to achieve this by allowing you to easily:

    1. Create and Manage your many Test Cases
    2. Build Test Suites out of queries, requirements or manually
    3. Execute those test cases and collect data on which tests have been executed against which builds
    4. Know and understand your test matrix
    5. Collect enough data automatically to be able to reproduce issues
    6. Collect enough data to create throw away automation

    These things alone would be enough to make it a must have solution, but add to that the integration described above, mix in a few partners and you have the ambrosia of tests management systems.

    #### Solution: Microsoft Test Manager from Microsoft

    Microsoft Test Manager provides support for some pretty advanced testing technics and while it is limited to Windows host it can be used against almost any application. It has some limitations on unmanaged and java application, but even most old web application can be fully tested. There are some features, like Intellitrace and Test Impact Analysis that are only supported on managed code, but really those are value adds rather than the core reason to move to MTM.

    [![Manage your Microsoft Test Manager Data Collectors](images/image_thumb39-2-2.png "Manage your Microsoft Test Manager Data Collectors")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image41.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Manage your Microsoft Test Manager Data Collectors**

    That said some of the built in data collectors in there are pretty cool:

    - **Video Recording** – Simply a video of the test session indexed by step
    - **Intellitrace** – like tivo for developers… debugging forward, backward and sideways
    - **Code Coverage** – Even for manual test you collect code coverage data
    - **System Information** – Windows version, running application
    - **Event Log** – Scrape specified events
    - **Test Impact Analysis** – log every method hit by your manual test so that we can match that to code paths changed and reduce our test matrix

    These features are awesome additions to the platform but they pale in comparison to the cop de resistance which is the **Action Recorder**. The action test recorder allows you to fast-forward you manual tests and gives one the ability to generate Coded UI tests.

    [![Test Manager allows you to manage the Test Steps](images/image_thumb40-3-3.png "Test Manager allows you to manage the Test Steps")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image42.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Test Manager allows you to manage the Test Steps**

    The abilities allow us to both manage our test cases and to record the data, and the test runner allows us to record the results and create actionable bugs. You see all the while that one is executing the tests the data recorders are collecting all of that lovely data and storing it.

    [![Microsoft Test Runner in action](images/image_thumb41-4-4.png "Microsoft Test Runner in action")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image43.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Microsoft Test Runner in action**

    And if while running one of your test cases you encounter a nasty little bug, you can have a rich actionable bug generated automatically making it easy for developers to isolate and find the problem.

    [![Microsoft Test Runner created Bugs from nowhere](images/image_thumb42-5-5.png "Microsoft Test Runner created Bugs from nowhere")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image44.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Microsoft Test Runner created Bugs from nowhere**

    The tool is in fact that good, as long as you are using managed code. The further you get from the modern development tools the less of these features will be available although you will always get the ability to run test cases and record the data.

    This is one of the best test tools in the industry and one of the few that help the manual tester.

    #### Solution: Web Test Manager from Sela

    In an effort to allow user more flexibility in managing their test cases and to allow your test cases to be run against any environment Sela have created their Web Test Manager which takes the entire Test Runner into the web.

    [![ Managing your Plans and Suites from the web](images/Sella-WTM-01_thumb-8-8.png " Managing your Plans and Suites from the web")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/Sella-WTM-01.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Managing your Plans and Suites from the web**

    Not only can you manage your plans and suits but they have also built a platform independent test runner so you can run your tests on Linux and against any browser.

    [![Edit and Run test cases from the web](images/Sella-WTM-02_thumb-9-9.png "Edit and Run test cases from the web")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/Sella-WTM-02.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Edit and Run test cases from the web**

    And what solution would be complete without the ability to see which tests have been passing and failing.

    There are still some rough edges, but Sela shows what can be done for testers leveraging the rich data management system within Team Foundation Server that links our Test Runs to Builds and requirements.

    ### Conclusion

    Even if you are only interested in moving away from Excel and Word for your test management Microsoft Test Manager is the best Manual Testing Management system. The integration that it has with build and Work Item Tracking will make it invaluable for those teams seeking to increase their agility. Do not think that these are in any way silver bullets and while the features are fantastic you may need to make subtle changes to your workflow or your software to take advantage of all of the awesomeness.

    The ultimate goal is to try and reduce the all to common scenario that we have not met the requirements or that we have not met the users expectations. The Manual Testing tools in Team Foundation Server can help you be providing a framework to have acceptance criteria begin to drive your engineering efforts and more frequently meet your customers expectations and reduce the waste inherent in software development.

    If we are building software in a modern application lifecycle there is no way that we would be able to deliver modern applications without some form of automated testing. Automated testing is the one thing that makes sure that we are able to deliver working software that meets the quality bar while still keeping the cycle time at an acceptable level.

    While we spend a disproportionate amount of time in manual testing we also spend an obscene amount of time maintaining and supporting any code automation that we create. These automated tests can represent at least the same amount of code that is required for our application but is often dismissed as an overhead to the solution.

    [![Automated Testing in a modern application lifecycle ](images/image_thumb5_thumb1_thumb_thumb-3-3.png "Automated Testing in a modern application lifecycle ")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image_thumb5_thumb1_thumb.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Automated Testing in a modern application lifecycle**

    If we have fear of changing our code because of the impact to our testing infrastructure we will always fail to deliver quality software.

    ### The Problem that automated testing solves

    We often have more tests than we can hope to run in a single iteration once we get passed the first initial pass and it is no longer acceptable for software to spend weeks or months in testing before being released. In a modern application lifecycle we tend to have small teams that create more and more tests cumulatively iteration on iteration. To still be able to deliver high quality value to our customers while maintaining the same level of coverage for our application requires automation, ideally we have automation for every test that is now passing. While initially hard, especially if we have an existing application, we need to bite the bullet and accept that it is no longer optional to refrain from contributing to our technical debt and start making bigger repayments.

    > Software is an organizational asset and decisions to cut quality must be made by executive management and reflected in the financial statements.
    >
    > Ken Schwaber in Professional Scrum Master Training

    While we need that automation to be a success, we also need to make sure that it is the right sort of automation for the goal. A sure indication that something is not quite right is that you spend too much time maintaining your automation. This usually means that you have not yet surmounted your technical debt gremlins.

    [![How automated testing fits into a modern application lifecycle](images/image_thumb43-1-1.png "How automated testing fits into a modern application lifecycle")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image45.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: How automated testing fits into a modern application lifecycle**

    You can find many classifications of automated tests from all over the internet and this is just a simple grouping classification rather than a definitive list:

    - **Unit Tests** – Discreet developer tests that exercise a single thing in isolation
    - **Integration Tests** – Discreet developer tests that exercise more than one thing working with other things
    - **UI Testing** – Indiscreet functional tests that exercise the User Interface directly

    The rest are mainly manual or based on highly complex tooling that is run against your software to determine things that can be done better and not on a constant basis.

    ### The integration of automated testing

    The integration with Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server is achieved simply by implementing a Test Adapter to allow your tests to be catalogued and executed from within the Visual Studio Test Runner.

    While this looks like a small thing initially, and especially as the code necessary to achieve it is fairly simple, it opens the door for a whole bunch of interactions. First is the ability to surface the pass/fail state of the tests in the Visual Studio Test Runner. This then enables one to have those tests executed either as the result of a user action, or as part of an automated build in Team Foundation Build.

    [![Axe from Odin Tech showing how it is done](images/image_thumb44-2-2.png "Axe from Odin Tech showing how it is done")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image46.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Axe from Odin Tech showing how it is done**

    This on its own would be awesome, but then you add the ability to associate any automated test that Visual Studio understands any MS Test Unit Test with a Test Case in Team Foundation Server and you are suddenly able to push those test results into Team Foundation Server and surface them in reporting.

    Now we know what tests we have, what the last result was and against which build…

    ### The solutions for automated testing

    There are many way in which to create automated tests and just about as many solutions. You should look for something that is easy to maintain, but don’t be afraid to make changes to your software to allow that to happen.

    The value of automated testing is to reduce the effort required by your Development Teams to produce a fully tested version of your software every iteration. As our Development Team is delivering value we need to make sure that we are meeting the criteria by which the customer will accept that the product is complete as well as the engineering assurance that the technical details are correct.

    #### Unit Testing

    The value in unit testing is to have built in validation that your developer not only created the correct functionality, but that any refactoring work did not impact that existing functionality. Think of it as a safety belt for engineers.

    - [**Unit Testing**](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio) from Microsoft – Create unit tests in almost any framework and use a unifies test runner to manage and run them all
    - [**SpecLog**](http://www.speclog.net/) from Techtalk – Turn your acceptance criteria in TFS into executable specifications that are still legible to the business and synced with TFS.

    However you do Unit Testing it is the choice of the engineers as professionals to implement it and not an organisations decision. You cant consider yourself a modern software engineering professional with out having what amounts to executable specification of what the software was supposed to do and thus proving that it does indeed do it with passing Unit Tests.

    #### UI Testing

    Just as the modern professional engineer does Unit Testing the modern Test Engineer requires to automate all of the testing that they do. While optional in yesteryear there is no way to build modern applications without the kind of UI automation that is readily available. These UI Automation technics either takes the form of generating code from manual tests, or from recording of automation directly against an application and often involves both.

    - [**Coded UI**](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio) from Microsoft - Coded UI takes Action Recordings from a manual tester and allows an engineer to generate the code required to test and assert that the UI works
    - [**Experitest**](http://experitest.com/) - Records tests from mobile devices including Android, iOS, Windows Mobile and Blackberry
    - [**Axe**](http://www.axetest.com/) from Odin Software – Stores test steps in Excel, generates automation and connects those automations to Test Cases in TFS
    - [**CloudTest**](http://www.soasta.com/products/cloudtest-lite/) from Soasta – Delivers functional test automation capabilities for multi-touch, gesture-based applications.
    - [**TestArchitect**](http://www.testarchitect.com/) from LogiGear – Create reusable keyword-based automations that allow testers to build tests like a jigsaw.
    - [**Squish**](http://www.froglogic.com/squish/) from FrogLogic  - Create cross platform user interface testing for Java, Windows, iOS, Mac and web.

    ### Conclusion

    Automated Testing is something that is no longer the purview of the larger development shops but part of the basic needs of any organisation building modern software. There is also no one tool to fit all of your scenarios and you may find yourself working with many of the products and solutions listed above. However all of these solutions integrate with both the Visual Studio IDE or Team Foundation Server to give you a consistency of design, execution and reporting that can’t be surpassed by any other product. If you have created your own tools for automated testing for your software then they can be easily incorporated by crating a simple Test Adapter.

    In the world of modern application development we have many more moving parts than we ever did before and it has become increasingly difficult for organisations to effectively simulate their environments with virtual labs.

    Add to that the demand from Development Teams to be able to have many times the environments that they ever had before and that they also want the ability to engage with any version of the software being supported. Both Operations Teams and Development Teams are already suffering under the yoke of complexity that modern applications demand and we are now bombarding them with an even greater immediacy of that need. As most organisations move towards delivering software to production at least every 30 days, with the increasing likelihood of continuous delivery both of these teams are ready to implode. While inevitable and required for survival, agility has a heavy price in change for your organisation, people, processes and tools.

    Are you ready to rise to the challenge?

    [![ Virtual Lab is part of the ALM Infrastructure that make it all happen](images/image_thumb33-1-1.png " Virtual Lab is part of the ALM Infrastructure that make it all happen")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image33.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Virtual Lab is part of the ALM Infrastructure that make it all happen**

    The advent of automated testing and virtualisation has gone a long way to help teams circumvent some of the complexities that building modern interconnected applications has brought. Indeed the Visual Studio 2012 platform has been designed to help these Development and Operational teams take back the team rooms and not just catch up, but get out ahead of the curve and deliver the value that the companies and consumers so desperately desire. Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server has continued to improve and simplify the Development Teams needs by integrating with Hyper-V directly.  However Hyper-V is but one of the many virtualisation platforms available on the market and there is ample room for partners to pick up the slack. Microsoft is putting its skills to work where it is needed most: in enhancing its own platform integration and providing the API’s necessary for partners with expertise and dedication to other platforms to flourish in that space.

    [![Virtual Labs are required as the modern application is always connected](images/image_thumb34-2-2.png "Virtual Labs are required as the modern application is always connected")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image34.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The modern application is always connected**

    These modern applications that we are envisaging and consumers (including your employees) are demanding are increasingly difficult to simulate as they are:

    - **Always on** – There is no safe time to down the servers
    - **Accessible anywhere** – Not just global, but any device, any platform
    - **high scale data management** – Today you have 10k users, tomorrow its 100k
    - **Constantly evolving**  - You will be updating frequently. At least every 30 days..

    Enabling these traits successfully without inherent abilities internally is not just tough, it is an impossible challenge.

    ### The Problems that Virtual Labs solve

    There are many issue that Engineering and Operations face on a near daily basis that are massively wasteful and that we should be able to at least alleviate with a clever application of existing and mature technology, however that technology is vastly complex and differs wildly in implementation.

    - Plethora of instances
    - False Positives
    - Automation maintenance

    Lets look at each of these in turn.

    #### Problem: Plethora of instances

    The number of instances that one is required to make available at any one time may be extremely prohibitive for even large organisations; thus inflating the cost of development beyond all sense with the additional equipment and manpower required. If you deploy thick clients to users desktops you may additionally have some varied lag in when those users update to the latest version. This may require that you support more than one version of your systems at a time; and it does not stop there. Lets imagine that you support **vCurrent** and **vLast** but lets say that you have one large customer still on **v**[**Shonkie**](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shonky) then we have 3 environments we need to be able to deploy and test for. What if two of your **vCurrent** customers have special and specific hotfixes (Call them **vCurrent+FlavourA** and **vCurrent+FlavourB**) for their wacky systems and while these hotfixes are just baked into **vNext** you still need to find out when a bug was introduced and how far reaching it is… that's now 6 environments… and we have not even started to count what we need for the Development Team and what about that new patch was in the news breaking everyone's software.

    1. Time spent wiping and reinstalling environments
    2. Time spent waiting for environments

    Not only is this a nightmare for the Development Teams it makes your Operations teams have heart attacks and your customers unhappy with the time it takes to get that new version ready..

    #### Problem: False Positives

    An issue that you can run into pretty early on, depending on the number of testers that you have, is that of “false positives”. False positives are things that look like a bug to Tester A, but it is in fact the result of an action by Tester B whom is testing in the same environment, neither of which are aware of the issue. You then have two distinct bugs to investigate, plan and ultimately one will get fixed before the other leaving a developer flummoxed around trying to reproduce a bug that no longer exists. These collisions can multiply exponentially as the number of testers increases.

    There are a number of areas of waste here:

    1. More than one team member is spending time documenting a bug
    2. There may be some investigation by the team to figure out how big the problem is
    3. Inclusion and understanding of the product owner to effectively order this on the backlog
    4. Development Team time in fixing and validating the problem

    In the initial bug instance there may be a solid linear resolution of the engineer and tester working together to fix the issue. Additional incidental bugs however can result is substantial waste as the engineer and testers struggle to reproduce a bug that no-longer exists and prove beyond doubt that it does not. Proving a negative is next to impossible.

    #### Problem: Automation maintenance

    A big issue is the time it takes to create automation and more than that, the time it takes to maintain it once it has been created. The time that it takes to create an automation should be … well… automatic, but the engineering effort that needs to be put into making your automation work against multiple environments can be immeasurable. This substantial effort includes parameterising your data, parameterising your environmental configuration and re-doing / updating everything when your software changes, which if at least every 30 days in the modern lifecycle. Most automation tools allow you to easily generate your automation, but they then force you to spend more effort maintaining that automation with far more skilled workers than you ever envisioned.

    There are many external factors that can render current automation efforts ineffectual and expensive:

    1. Multiple data sets that require post generation parameterisation of your automated tests
    2. Changes in environments and configurations between test runs
    3. New features that invalidate tests

    While we can never get away from having to redo much of our automation when the product that we are automating changes, we can at least prevent the need to cater for environmental differences that may include DNS, IP Addresses and accounts through ought your entire stack.

    ### Integration Points for Virtual Labs

    There are three main integration points for any Virtual Lab environment to weave itself into the Visual Studio Team Foundation Server systems. We start with Creation move on to Deployment and end up at Testing.

    [![Virtual Lab Integration points with Visual Studio 2012](images/image_thumb35-3-3.png "Virtual Lab Integration points with Visual Studio 2012")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/virtual-labs-in-the-modern-application-lifecycle-workflow.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Virtual Lab Integration points**

    In each of these flows of integration there are three levels that the vendors can achieve. The first two already exist but the last would require some additional API’s in the product to support. One of the reasons that the team has not built these in is that there are currently no partners trying to integrate at this level.

    [![Virtual Labs are part Team Foundation Server Overview](images/image_thumb36-4-4.png "Virtual Labs are part Team Foundation Server Overview")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image36.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Foundation Server Overview**

    Conversely partners need to know what the goal of integration is in order to support modern application development so that they can rise to the challenge and encourage the product team to prioritise those PBI’s that achieve these capabilities.

    #### Integration Level 1 (Create | Deploy | Test)

    The first stage can  be achieved by any partner in the virtualisation space already. In fact there are a number of partners that have started to even provide level 2 support and still more that provide support for #3 outside of Microsoft Test Manager. However we want to be able to use Test Professional’s Lab Manager and Test Manager to orchestrate and control all of these things. There are some configurations that would by necessity, as one would already have to do with load tests, be outside of the tool although the day-to-day work should be in the tool.

    At this level partners would allow a user to:

    1. **Create** – Create environments on-demand
    2. **Deployment** – Deploy their software to these environments
    3. **Testing** – Perform tests from these environments

    In #3 above the provider would be able to open a couple of ports to allow the installation and use of Microsoft Test Manager from inside of these environments to push the results of the manual testing back to Team Foundation Server. These are all things that do not require the partner to write a single line of integration for.

    #### Integration Level 2 (Creation Automation | Deployment Automation  | Testing Automation)

    Once you have the ability to perform the first set of create, deploy and test we can then move onto the automation of those capabilities. We now want to be able to use the orchestration capabilities of workflow within Team Foundation Build to automate the process of spinning up new virtual environments and even deploying ones software to those environments so that I do not need to be present or interact to come into the office in the morning with a deployed and working environment.

    1. **Create Automation** – Provide build activities to allow creation
    2. **Deployment Automation** – Provide build activities for deployment
    3. **Testing Automation** – provide activities for test orchestration

    To achieve this the partner can leverage the capabilities of Team Foundation Build provided by Windows Workflow and create Activities that can be slotted into a .xaml build workflow to provide the automation required. And advanced solution from a partner would include full build workflow templates for users to just pick up and use. As part of enabling the deployment automation of #2 the likelihood is that it would be a short leap to the automated testing of #3 as the technology used is identical.

    While the partner would need to invest some not insignificant development effort in providing a robust set of Windows Workflow Activities and Build Automation Templates all of the API’s and capabilities are built into the product for them to take advantage of this.

    note: The automatic installation capabilities of MTM and Lab Management currently rely on the “File and Print Sharing” API’s in Windows to enable some of the automation. This will not work in the cloud and it is likely that the product team is looking to replace much of this functionality with purpose-built custom extensible framework.

    note: Some partners are providing awesome third-party automation tooling that can simulate many users accessing your application. These tools are outside of the Virtual Labs topic but provide tremendous value to the subscribers.

    #### Integration Level 3 (Creation via Lab Management| Deployment by Lab Management  | Testing via Microsoft Test Manager)

    The third level of integration is, as you can imagine, the tightest of all and would provide the users with a seamless experience whither they are using Hyper-v or some other services as the virtualisation platform. There are many value adds that the individual partners can provide and many of the customers just want things to work out-of-the-box before they take on that additional functionality.

    1. **Create from Test Manager**– Provide the MTM hooks to allow it to spin-up and configure your environments
    2. **Deploy from Test Manager** – Allow user to deploy a version of their software directly from MTM
    3. **Testing from Test Manager** – Allow users to connect to your environment from MTM and run manual tests

    The only currently supported virtualisation technology underpinning Lab Manager is Hyper-V, but with the push towards cloud support it does not take a stretch of the imagination to believe that the product team are working to allow support for Azure. In working on this we now no longer have a single, but two interchangeable layers between on-premises and cloud which to me means that the API’s required to have any underlying infrastructure supported would need to exist. This would then open the way for partners to create support for Amazon AWS or Rackspace Cloud and indeed allow for first level support of automation for partners that currently support scale out testing and infrastructure options.

    ### Solution: Hyper-V (OOB)

    The implementation of Lab Management that comes out of the box is with Hyper-V. This is designed for teams building software that is deployed locally on Microsoft technologies. For most teams it will suit there needs even if they are used to implementing VM Ware as this new environment is dedicated to the development teams. You would not expect there to be a copy of TFS that runs on Oracle ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile2-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    The integration of Lab Management and Hyper-V from the product team also augments many of the base capabilities to

    - **Creation** – Our environments are packages with many components
    - **Snapshot** – A point in time across the board
    - **Deployment** – Getting our build output into play

    There are additional capabilities provided by the Test Agents and Build Agents of Team Foundation Server but they are not specific to the Hyper-V integration. Indeed you can create “environments” for Lab Management from what Lab Management calls “physical” machines but more accurately is made up of “Unmanaged” machines.

    ### Solution: Cloudshare

    CloudShare are providing the ability to spin up infrastructure and environments for your development & testing needs very quickly with preconfigured environments. These environments may be used for building, unit-testing or functional testing via TFS Lab Manager that allow you to integrate their environments with your local workflow.

    CloudShare specialise in SharePoint environments and with the new features coming in Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server Update 1 for CodedUI and Manual Testing in SharePoint 2010 their solution becomes even more relevant. They are currently only offering:

    - **Creation** – Manually create environments
    - [**Manual Deployment**](http://blog.cloudshare.com/2012/06/18/using-tfs-service-preview-for-sharepoint-team-development-with-cloudshare/) – Deploy from Visual Studio only
    - **Manual Testing** – Use Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) to perform tests
    - **Automated Test** – Allow automated tests to be run in Visual Studio

    These are all currently “level 1” integration features and I am looking forward to tighter integration coming from CloudShare in the future.

    ### Conclusion

    In order to continuously monitor the progress of the project we need to be able to auto-magically build and deploy our software to multiple elastic environments that are then tested before a human being pulled in to either fix an issue or move forward with the known working build. The only way to achieve this is to make software available to Development Teams using virtual images that collect all of the data required to not only monitor the health of our project constantly, but also to have all of the data to hand when a rich actionable bug needs to be created.

    This allows us to integrate both the Development and Operations teams to achieve a regularly high velocity while simultaneously reducing the mean time to repair and the operations cycle time. But what does that give us… well it allows us to build more software, faster with a higher built-in quality with less technical debt dragging us down.

    - **Hyper-V** from Microsoft
    - [**Cloudshare**](http://www.cloudshare.com/)
    - **Lab Manager** from VMWare
    - **AWS** from Amazon
    - **Azure** from Microsoft

    I hope that in the near future all of the products above will be able to be plugged into Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server’s Lab Management capability to make them seamless to the development teams. I want to be able to create an environment in Lab Manager and have the backing store be any of the above services.

    Are you ready to rise to the challenge of building modern applications?

    Unless you have been living under a rock you might have noticed [a little launch event](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio) recently. Well to complement the launch Microsoft is running a bunch of Visual Studio 2012 Launch RoadShows around the world:

    - [**Visual Studio 2012 Launch RoadShow UK**](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2012/09/06/event-visual-studio-2012-launch-roadshow.aspx) (Edinburgh | Manchester | London | Reading)
    - [**Visual Studio 2012 Launch RoadShow US**](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dajung/archive/2012/09/20/visual-studio-2012-launch-roadshow.aspx) (Lehi | Tempe | San Diego | Irvine | Mountain View | San Francisco | Portland | Boise)
    - [**Visual Studio 2012 Launch RoadShow Netherlands**](http://www.clemensreijnen.nl/post/2012/09/22/Visual-Studio-Launch-Roadshows-and-Workshops-in-the-Netherlands.aspx)

    If you are going to be in California around the 9th and 10th of October then you might catch me doing two sessions each in San Diego and Irvine.

    ### Keynote – Evolve: Rediscover Relevancy

    Organizations need to be aware that the New Normal is a world where the Consumer is now in the drivers seat and that the [consumerisation of IT](http://blog.nwcadence.com/consumerization-of-it-and-my-cup-of-coffee/) is rendering yesterday’s development practices obsolete.

    ![Evolve: Rediscover Relevancy](images/image38-1-1.png "Evolve: Rediscover Relevancy")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Evolve: Rediscover Relevancy**

    Have you adapted your development practices and strategies to ensure you are maintaining your relevancy?

    ### Session – Revolution: The Agile Developer

    With this new normal the quality level expected of engineers is much higher than ever before and we need to rise to the challenge. We ill be required to produce better software with quality built in rather than the avoidable expense of testing quality in.

    ![Revolution: The Agile Developer](images/image39-2-2.png "Revolution: The Agile Developer")  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Revolution: The Agile Developer**

    The engineering half of the Agile Developer needs tools to help them make life that much easier on their tester alter ego and on the businesses pocket book.

    Join me on [9th/10th of October in San Diego or Irvine](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/events/) to usher in a new era of software quality and delivery…

    Immediately after configuring the TFS Integration Tools you receive a  TFS WIT invalid submission conflict type that states that the source item is invalid.

    [![image](images/image_thumb32-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image32.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The source item is invalid**

    There is no further debug information.

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools, version 2.2, March 2012

    ### Findings

    While this immediately looks like a problem with the configuration and can indeed be related to [a configuration or date conversation issue](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/creating-a-wit-adapter-for-the-tfs-integration-platform-for-a-source-with-no-history/) if you have just installed the TFS Integration Tools there may be a simpler resolution.

    The first thing to do is to enable [TFS WIT bypass-rule submission rule](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-integration-tools-issue-tfs-wit-bypass-rule-submission-is-enabled/) in the configuration and make sure that your account is in the “Service Accounts Group”.

    [![SNAGHTML4fa77b8](images/SNAGHTML4fa77b8_thumb-3-3.png "SNAGHTML4fa77b8")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/SNAGHTML4fa77b8.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Access Denied**

    If however you get “Access denied” with you account not having “Edit collection-level information” then the account that you are using to access TFS does not have the correct permission.

    ### Solution

    You need to make sure that the account under which you are running the TFS Integration Tools is at least a “Collection Administrator” and preferably a “Team Foundation Administrator”. There are many things that the TFS Integration Tools do that requires this level of permission.

    note: I recommend building and testing all of your scripts/configurations against a test server, or at the very least a throw-away collection before you work against production.

    You should now be able to successfully run your configuration although I can’t guarantee further errors ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-4-4.png)

    Managing requirements is hard and no single tool can tell you how to achieve that within your organisation. To that end, Visual Studio 2012 TFS stays out of the “where do your requirements come from” world and firmly in the “i have my requirements.. .what now?” world and indeed the tools built on top of the requirement management system stay in one niche.

    - Update 2013-01-08 - Featured in [ALM Mag Vol 1 Issue 1](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2013/02/Hinshelwood-ALMMag-Vol1Issue1.pdf). If you want to subscribe to future editions I have a [discount subscription](http://www.member.almmag.com/sales.php?coupon=foundingmember) that you can use.
    - Update 2012-09-11 - I have updated the list of tools available

    [![Requirement Management is part of Define / Ideation](images/image_thumb8-12-12.png "Requirement Management is part of Define / Ideation")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image8.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Requirement Management is part of Define / Ideation**

    Team Foundation Server aims to become your matter of record or single-point-of-truth for what state your requirements are in, what the details of that requirement are, who is currently working on it and who changed what when.

    The system has lists of work item that can have any number of fields with configurable forms and permissions along with many other features out-of-the-box and you can store data against these fields with TFS storing a revision history so we can get back to any version that we like. All users authenticate is some way with a single unified authority so we get [full digital signature traceability through the system](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CCkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.hinshelwood.com%2Fhow-visual-studio-2010-and-team-foundation-server-enable-compliance%2F&ei=_bU7UIrYIIfiiALryID4BQ&usg=AFQjCNFmVLQ2iTi2XqYLms_BQRgbYYKP6w&sig2=w4hPuSCv18tlH7ba5iNEcg) which allows TFS to fully support and comply with [Sarbanes-Oxley](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg983694), [FDA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh134108) and [PCI-DSS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh327801) to name but a few.

    [![Storing data in forms and state transition for the bedrock of requirement management](images/image_thumb9-13-13.png "Storing data in forms and state transition for the bedrock of requirement management")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image9.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Storing data in forms and state transition**

    But while Team Foundation Server fully supports that recording and traceability there are only a few tools for figuring out where the requirements come from.

    [![Traceability of every change to every field with requirement management](images/image_thumb10-2-2.png "Traceability of every change to every field with requirement management")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image10.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: T**raceability** of every change to every field**

    ### The Problem

    The problems that TFS can’t solve for you, and no other tool out there can either, is that creating clear and actionable requirements is hard. Capturing requirements is so hard that most, if not all, software created today does not meet the value expectations of the customer. Part of this is due to a gap between the customers understanding of what was asked for and IT’s interpretation of that requirement but much of it is the inability for requirements to be captured in a timely and well documented fashion.

    [![image](images/image_thumb11-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image11.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure:** [**Code does not meet requirements**](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Race-Case.aspx)

    We need to be able to reduce the requirements definition cycle time and much more effectively capture the details of those requirements so that we can execute. To achieve this we need more than a matter of record and while there are a number of awesome tools out of the box, Microsoft has recognised that it cant be all things to all men, and cant build all tools for all situation. They have encouraged an ecosystem of partners that can fill these gaps and provide value to customers.

    ### Integration Points for Requirement Management

    There are many integration points with Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server but the key here is the TFS API and its flexible Work Item Tracking model. The Work Item Tracking system that contains Work item Type Definitions (Requirement, PBI, User Story, Bug, Task, Test Case, etc.) that have Field Definitions (Title, Description, Effort, Remaining Work, State, etc.) all of which can be customised.

    [![image](images/image_thumb12-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image12.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Custom Link Types**

    There is a built in linking system that allows not just hierarchical lists, but the ability to create your own bi-directional linking taxonomy. For example the existing process templates contain a “tests / tested by” relationship that allows you to have a directional relationship between a bug and a test case. i.e. a Bug is “tested by” one or more Test Case(s) and visa versa. These links can be between any of the built in artefact types and indeed you can link to your own external artefacts to enable deeper integration with the product.

    [![image](images/image_thumb13-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image13.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Foundation Server Overview**

    The revision history is atomically stored for each change but also allows for merging as long as there are no individual field conflicts. This revision history allows for rich reporting that is configurable for each field and you can set the reportability of each of the fields which enables the data they contain to be visible as a detail in the Data Warehouse for lists or indeed as a Measure / Dimension in an Analysis Services Cube for trend analysis.

    [![image](images/image_thumb14-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image14.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Customize Work Item Types**

    Because everyone is authenticated the same across all parts of the system you have a single model for identifying an individual, their permissions and their actions. You can add custom fields to an individual Work Item Type Definition or globally to to all Work Item Type Definitions on the Team Foundation Server.

    So the Key Integration Points are:

    - **Linking**  
       One or more work items in TFS link by unique identifier to one or more items in the partner system but no sync of data takes place or a one-time only sync occurs (copy). This is the
    - **Syncing**  
       A copy of the work item data resides in both TFS and the Partner system allowing for tight bi-directional integration.
    - **Loading**  
       The partner system does not store any data directly but instead exclusively stores all of its data in TFS.

    These integration points represent a tightening of the gap between products and as partner products move from Lining through Synching to Loading they become able to provide a much richer feature set to their users. Products that get all the way to Loading can concentrate on adding value to their customers while not having to build all of the infrastructure required to deliver it.

    ### Solution: Team Companion from Ekobit (Partner)

    If you don’t know Team Companion then you should. It is by far the best of breed in integrating Team Foundation Server and Outlook. It lets your team members and managers that spend their lives in Outlook work with Work Items, manage Sprints / Iteration and report right from the familiar ground of Outlook.

    [![work items](images/work-items_thumb-17-17.jpg "work items")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/work-items.jpg)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Work Items from Team Foundation Server In Outlook**

    By allowing folks to work directly in Outlook the guys at Ekobit have maintained the fluent paradigms from Outlook which manifests in making Work Items “feel” like emails with history and a purpose. In addition you can create Work items form emails and emails from work items with the ability for Team Companion to track that history through both products.

    [![reports](images/reports_thumb-16-16.jpg "reports")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/reports.jpg)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Access you reports**

    And its not just work item, you can access both Team Companion real-time reporting as well as surface the reports provided out of the box in TFS.

    [![documents](images/documents_thumb-1-1.jpg "documents")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/documents.jpg)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Even interact with SharePoint**

    Just as TFS talks and stored documents in SharePoint so does Team Companion again allowing everyone to collaborate against this single point of truth for all data regarding the product. Team Companion integrates with a hybrid Syncing / Loading interaction that is made possible through adding the capabilities of Outlook and its offline capability to the mix. Yes, you can go offline, update you workl items and sync when you come back online and if you are using TFS 2012 you can take advantage of the field collision model that allows for merging of work item changes. Much more flexible…

    I use Team Companion and so should you…

    ### Solution: Caliber from Borland (Partner)

    If you have enterprise teams that require more structure while still allowing teams to decide hoe best to build and deliver the software that they are building then you need a tool that embodies that vision so that it will grow into that space as you do.

    [![POR_Caliber_01](images/POR_Caliber_01_thumb-15-15.gif "POR_Caliber_01")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/POR_Caliber_01.gif)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Ideation and **traceability** in Caliber**

    Caliber is best for organisations that need more viability from inception to delivery of a requirement and especially when there are compliance requirements as there are in many industries. I had the opportunity to meet some of the developers and the tooling and interaction was pretty cool. The are using a “Linking” style integration that allows them to interoperate with multiple systems this gives you the flexibility of Business Analysts using one tool even across multiple development teams building in multiple technologies on multiple ALM platforms. Awesome…

    ### Solution: Agile Project Management Tools from Microsoft (OOB)

    The Product Team is betting on its “Agile Project Planning” tools to support the majority of teams. Most teams are not large and most teams out in the wild either are doing agile or want to be. If you are a team that works in the pure agile world or your want to just start understanding what you have in inventory then vanilla Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server is for you.

    These tools fit into the “Lightweight requirements gathering” category and provide an integrated methods od doing Story Boarding that allows you to create animations and shapes to represent your ideation with ease. You can link these documents to Work Items and break them down into something that can fit into a sprint.

    [![image](images/image_thumb15-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image15.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: PowerPoint Storyboarding**

    In addition to story boarding Microsoft has also provides an integrated feedback mechanism to allow someone in the Product Owner role to solicit constructive and rich feedback from their stakeholders.

    [![image](images/image_thumb16-8-8.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image16.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Constructive Feedback**

    These feedback responses are stored in a work item in TFS and can again be broke down into actionable requirements or bugs.

    **Figure: Product Backlog Management**

    Once you have a backlog you need to be able to manage it. It is an asset of your project and an unmaintained asset will atrophy and depreciate.

    ### Solution: InteGREAT from eDev (Partner)

    If you want to achieve more Formal Requirements within Team Foundation Server then you should be looking towards eDev’s InteGREAT product. This tool is designed for Business Analysts that want to do formal requirement gathering It integrates well with the new Visual Studio 2012 Agile Planning tools to allow your team to agilely deliver incremental and continuous value while your analysts maintain your vision and processes. It even has questionnaires so that you can get make sure that you always capture all of the relevant information during your analysis.

    [![image](images/image_thumb18-10-10.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image18.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Manage you Vision**

    Being able to draw and maintain your business processes all linked to the individual items being delivered by your software teams is invaluable.

    ![](images/1172.image_5F00_1C886D67.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Business Process Diagrams**

    Not only that but its built in reporting tools can help you generate the documentation that you require for audit or just to read.

    ![](images/0511.image_5F00_5894AF1C.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Generate Word documents**

    In addition and almost best of all it will allow you to build out all of your pre-identified Test Cases that you can then add to as your teams deliver product.

    InterGREAT fills that niche of being able to capture all of the information required, analyse it and present it for teams to effectively execute and deliver. As it links all of the items together and integrates with TFS it reduces the requirements definition cycle by reducing the overall total-cost-of-ownership of your inventory of requirements and the vision that goes into them.

    ### Conclusion

    While TFS has built in support and tools for many situations the front end tools can’t support everyone. They are building their tooling to support the common cause and that common cause is agile. While I have mentioned only four solutions above that are many other solutions like **TeamPulse** from Telerik and **Specklog** from TechTalk and I will be delving into these products in the future.

    **Figure: 35% are doing agile, 30.6% want to**

    More and more organisations are moving towards a more agile approach in order to jumpstart their business to support the constant shift in the market place. As more and more companies become more agile, consumers are coming to expect frequent iterations or they will go else where. This may seam like an attention disorder, but their needs are constantly changing in todays world. As consumers begin to expect this model the rolling affect is that the business community is to. Your customers are also consumers and they want their iPad on the corporate network.

    Just look at [Brian Harry’s](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry) recent post on the new [TFS Shipping Cadence](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/08/28/tfs-shipping-cadence.aspx) and I hope you will see that continuous deliver and the pursuit of tighter feedback loops is an inevitability not an optional exercise or a tend that will go away.

    The partners and products above will help you on that road to agility and bridge that gap between what you need to do and what the product does in your particular circumstances. Think of the tools above as extensions of Team Foundation Server tailored to fit a niche and indeed all of the above partner products are shipping simultaneously with Visual Studio 2012.

    [![WPEngine-Logo-300x125](images/WPEngine-Logo-300x125_thumb-11-11.jpg "WPEngine-Logo-300x125")](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=394686&u=687520&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=)You may have noticed a little down time today. Thanks to the folks who emails to let me now of problems, some I was already on top of… others needed a good poking. The downtime was due to me moving my hosting provider. This blog has had a few homes over the years (my goodness…6 years!) and as it has grown so it has slowed. My site is image heavy and I also make poor choice of plugins in favour of features. It has been a constant annoyance for me that my blog has had abysmal loading times of late.

    **Figure: An average of 15s in the last month sucks**

    I think you can see my issue… and often I have been hit by shared server syndrome with the only response from support being “someone must be running a process on the server” and “it will probably end soon” with a little bit of “well we cant kill someone else's process!” and I think that was the final straw. If I am on a shared environment I expect my provider to protect me from the other Muppets kicking the box as well as myself.

    So my blog has gone through many iteration:

    1. **Move from GeeksWithBlogs to Wordpress on DiscountASP.NET ($3 per month)**  
       This was a features issue as I was happy with the speed from GWB
    2. **Moved from DiscountASP.NET to GoDaddy ($5 per month)**  
       Unless you want to spring $100 per months for a dedicated server DiscountASP.NET is not good for hosting a production site. It was sllowwww…
    3. **Moved from GoDaddy to [WPEngine](http://wpengine.com/?SSAID=687520) ($29 per month)  
       **GoDaddy have a little better support but still with the slow.

    And now I have moved to WPEngine. Although they offer a service to move you blog for you for $200, but I am hard-core and wanted to feel the pain myself ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-10-10.png)
    { .post-img }

    But nicely enough the provide some [awesome instructions](http://support.wpengine.com/migration-process/?SSAID=687520) that gave me an almost seamless migration. Luckily I have had to debug crappy plugins doing weird stuff before and I have my own crazy DNS setup that I have had for a few years…

    **Figure: W3 Cache plugin messing up my site**

    While there are many awesome plugins you can often have a little trouble with installing, activating and deleting in the right order across a Multi-Site implementation of Wordpress, but there is now hope!

    The nice folks over at WP Engine have a list of [disallowed plugins](http://support.wpengine.com/disallowed-plugins/?SSAID=687520) that they absolutely will delete from the site of anyone that implements them. These are plugins that they have identified as just plain sucking form a performance standpoint and I salute them for laying down those terms… we users need protection from the evils that we do not fully understand and this helps a little. So what do I get at WP Engine that I did not get elsewhere?

    1.  **Dedicated support for word press and most plugins**
        In the 3-4 hours it took to get all my ducks in a row for moving my site I had 5 support tickets knocked off. Each and every one was answered within 15 minutes and dealt with within 60. Not bad ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-10-10.png)
        { .post-img }
    2.  **Snapshots**

        Going to change some settings? Try something out? Create a Snapshot at the click of a button and have it restored at another click… Awesome.

    3.  **Staging Area**

        Going to do something even more dangerous that you are not sure will work? Click the Staging button and WP Engine will create a duplicate of your site for you to practice with. You get one staging area and can over write it any time you like.

    4.  **Speed…**

        This is the biggest one for you. Promises for you to have a faster site.

    After looking at the list of “disavowed” plugins I decided to kill the ones that I was using on GoDaddy and I got a %50 increases or more on my site just with that. So the following comparison is plugin neutral. Check out the screenie from Google Analytics above for the “before” the great plugin cull of August 2012.

    My homepage lists the short form of the posts and has a couple of controls that help folks navigate and has been reduced from 8s to 2s.. that's 4 times faster.

    **Figure: Homepage After (WP Engine)**

    As the aggressive caching kicks in these numbers will only improve, but my Events page, which makes use of a lot of data has gone from 10s to 5 seconds… 2 times faster.

    And I picked a significantly large post with lots of images to get 6s before and ~2s after… that's nearly a 3 times improvement.

    **Figure: Big Post After**

    But its not the number that matter. My blog now feels responsive and I don’t roll my eyes every time I want to view another page. This is what I am happy with…and all of the pain of moving was worth the result..so far ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-10-10.png)

    No matter what permissions you set or what permissions you have you get a “TF30063: You are not authorized to access /Services/v3.0/LocationService.asmx” in SharePoint 2010.

    **Figure: Cannot trace permissions on this item**

    ### Applies to

    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server
    - Microsoft SharePoint 2010

    ### Findings

    I don't know how unique my case is, but if you have searched the heck out of “[TF30063: You are not authorized to access LocationService](http://bit.ly/NzeeoM "http://bit.ly/NzeeoM")” and you still can’t find the issue then it is simple.

    You do not have permission to read items in TFS from SharePoint!

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Ahhhhhhhhhh**

    But I am logged in as the TFS Service account, TFS Administrator account and a SharePoint Farm Admin… how many more permission do I need! Here is the deal… you have a “deny” in your permission list somewhere. Deny takes presidence over any other permission. So if you have a deny high up but an allow lower down then this is just tough… denied. And if it is doing this for all of your users regardless of permissions or groups then I have a suspension that there is some deny high up in TFS. There are only two groups that apply to everyone…

    **Figure: \[TEAM FOUNDATION\]Team Foundation Valid User**

    There are two places to look for global deny’s and that is the “Valid User” groups at either the server or at the collection level.

    In this case we upgraded from Team Foundation Server 2008 to 2012 so any permissions carried over would be at the Collection level, so lets start there…

    I can’t imagine what was trying to be achieved by this… so I will leave you with…

    When you queue a build you never get a build number and the build never completes. [![image](images/image_thumb109-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image110.png)

    **Figure: Stuck build**

    You can see the two previous attempts with no build number.

    ### Applies to

    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    If you are having this problem then the first thing to check is the logs…

    [![image](images/image_thumb110-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image111.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Diagnostics has blank logs**

    But no… there are no logs to view…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Nasty red stop sign**

    Next thing is to check the controller and see what is going on. In this case the Build Service is in the “Started” state and the Controller is in the “Ready” state, but there is a little red square that I guess signifies “Stopped” on the graphic.

    This is a little confusing as it looks like all is well except for the red.

    > Please can we make the red square and green play button a tick and a cross so that it is consistent with the rest of the product, or at lease a cross for error, tick for ok and the red stop for… well.. stopped…  
    > **\-Suggestion to the TFS Product Team**

    As this may have been a problem with this server I moved the controller to the same server as the agents to see what effect this would have. I had been having a bunch of issues with this server and this was part of my “last ditch efforts” though patterns. I did look in the event log, but I did not notice something important.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Agents and Controllers on a separate server is worse**

    At this point I asked for some help and was asked if I had clicked that little “details” button. I had not, face palm, and I did not… low and behold this was a web service problem…now.. I has seen some errors earlier,  but I did not think that they related so time to check the event log with a little more scrutiny.

    **Figure: http 500 errors smack of IIS or Web Services**

    The error logs showed an interesting exception… some kind of WebHost error…

    ```
    WebHost failed to process a request.

    ```

    **Figure: WebHost failed to process a request**

    The error message talks of “This collection already contains an address with scheme http”, dam but it is pulling a Highlander on me (There can be only one). So lets take a look at the IIS settings…

    [![image](images/image_thumb113-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image114.png)

    **Figure: There  are multiple host headers on TFS in IIS**

    Sure enough there are three entries for http in the bindings. I had seen them before in there but though nothing of it… why would you not be able to add a bunch of host headers to an IIS site!

    ### Workaround

    The web.config for the message queuing web service is in the “Microsoft Team Foundation Server 11.0Application TierMessage Queue” and I followed the instructions to add multipleSiteBindingsEnabled  to the serviceHostingEnvironment element.

    ```
    <serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled="true" multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true" />

    ```

    **Figure: Multiple site bindings enabled**

    Now when I restart the Team Foundation Build service I get all green “play” graphics. (hope)

    Checking the event log shows no new errors and the services still show green. (expectation)

    Kicking of a build results in… a build number and a failed build. (elation)

    **Figure: Build failed… whoop… success…**

    While this may be a failed build it is a success for this exercise of getting the build server working…

    Thanks to Patrick Carnahan for his help on this one.

    If you have multiple service accounts for TFS 2012 and you are in a corporation chances are that two things are true:

    1. **Your accounts are managed out-with your control in Active Directory**
    2. **They will expire every 90 days**  
       It is however worth asking your IT department if they can set different expiry rules for service accounts

    If these things are true and you work in an awesome origination that his its stuff together you will get an email when they are expiring.

    If you change the WorkSpaceRoot in “C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration ToolsMigrationToolServers.config” you may get an access to path is denied when manually resolving conflicts as per [TFS Integration Tools – Issue: TF10141 No Files checked in as a result of a TFS check-in failure](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-integration-tools-issue-tf10141-no-files-checked-in-as-a-result-of-a-tfs-check-in-failure/).

    **Figure: Sorry we were unable to resolve the conflict**

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools, version 2.2, March 2012

    ### Findings

    If you altered WorkSpaceRoot  in MigrationToolServers.config because you encountered some path problems then you will not have the correct permissions on the folder.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Permission for TFSIPEXEC_WPG is missing**

    This is because when you changed the path the TFS Integration Platform did not add the required permissions to it.

    ### Solution

    Add the TFSIPEXEC_WPG permission to the folder with full rights.

    On of the issues that we have had in the office recently is that the rest of the Office, through no fault of their own, speaks and uses American English. I however along with the majority of the English speaking world use British English.

    Microsoft have recognised this with the inclusion of Windows 8 (English-United Kingdom) as an edition of Windows that you can install.

    [![SNAGHTMLb0f0b01](images/SNAGHTMLb0f0b01_thumb-7-7.png "SNAGHTMLb0f0b01")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/SNAGHTMLb0f0b01.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Windows 8 (English-United Kingdom)**

    This will then give us the holly grail of Favourite spelled correctly in Windows!

    Using the obvious truth of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language) I make it around **2,121,502,169** people live in countries that have English as their national language and only **309,442,00** of which are American English… give or take…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Who speaks what where**

    Yes, I realise that I am being wholly unscientific and that I currently live smack in that red area, but I just can’t bear to go native where language is concerned. Every time I see an incorrect spelling of “Tire”, “Favourite” or “Serialise” I have and insatiable itch to fix it…

    **Macros to the rescue**

    Word is easy.. if you want to change the default language all you do is Ctrl+A to select all of the text and change it.

    **Figure: Changing document language**

    Similarly the reverse is true and you can have your bad spelling ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile4-8-8.png)
    { .post-img }

    PowerPoint is a little more difficult. You need to change it for every shape and there is no way to globally change this. Which does kind of suck, but not is you know macros. So fire up your “Developer” bar, select “Add Code” and create a new module.

    [![image](images/image_thumb103-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image104.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: How to get the developer bar**

    To that module you can then add the following code.

    ```
    Option Explicit
    Public Sub ChangeSpellCheckingLanguageUK()
        Dim j As Integer, k As Integer, scount As Integer, fcount As Integer
        scount = ActivePresentation.Slides.Count
        For j = 1 To scount
            fcount = ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes.Count
            For k = 1 To fcount
                If ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes(k).HasTextFrame Then
                    ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes(k) _
                    .TextFrame.TextRange.LanguageID = msoLanguageIDEnglishUK
                End If
            Next k
        Next j
    End Sub


    Public Sub ChangeSpellCheckingLanguageUS()
        Dim j As Integer, k As Integer, scount As Integer, fcount As Integer
        scount = ActivePresentation.Slides.Count
        For j = 1 To scount
            fcount = ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes.Count
            For k = 1 To fcount
                If ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes(k).HasTextFrame Then
                    ActivePresentation.Slides(j).Shapes(k) _
                    .TextFrame.TextRange.LanguageID = msoLanguageIDEnglishUS
                End If
            Next k
        Next j
    End Sub

    ```

    Now at the click of a button you can change the whole presentation from “Bad English” to “Good English” and back again.

    Do you have parents that could not install an application let alone and operating system? Do they live in a country other than the one that you are currently in? Well mine do and the thing that helps me most in helping them is a little app called Team Viewer.

    [![SNAGHTML60a890c](images/SNAGHTML60a890c_thumb-16-16.png "SNAGHTML60a890c")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/SNAGHTML60a890c.png)

    **Figure: Team Viewer is the best remote software**

    It works over very high latency allows me to have video and whatever running so I can , for example, help my parents view a slideshow in Sugar Sync (another must have tool) while video conferencing with them over Skype. And best of all it is free for home use…

    **Figure: Me helping parents**

    The other thing that I help them with is that crazy technical stuff… you know… installing applications, adding users, closing windows… and there is nothing more technical than upgrading an Operating System! I have read a lot about Windows 8 upgrades and everything I have seen is that it is a painless experience and just works. So I firmly believe that if my father could put his fear he could have handled this with no problems.

    **Figure: Running the Windows 8 install over Team Viewer**

    I started by unpacking the Windows 8 ISO to their local disk using WinRAR. I could have mounted and then copied the files, but this gets it done in one go. This will allow me to run the installer from within windows rather than booting of a USB. As I don't have physical access to the computer this makes sense, but we shall see if physical interaction during the upgrade is required. I am kicking this off at 13:30 and we will see how long it will take…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I will be keeping everything**

    The Windows 8 installer presents you with three options:

    - Keep Windows settings, personal files and applications (recommended)
    - Keep personal files only
    - Nothing

    As my parents don't use that many applications and likely most of them will just work I will keep everything. This may mean that some of the application will need reinstalled, but se la vie.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Verification of stuff**

    After you select the option that you want the installer will do a bunch of checks to make sure that your system is ready for Windows 8. This will check all of the installed applications and drivers for compatibility so it may take a while depending on how fast your computer hardware is and how many applications you have installed.

    **Figure: You need to uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials**

    Although my parents have a fair number of apps installed including all that crap-ware that comes with a new computer (no they have never reinstalled) there was only one issue detected…

    AS Windows 8 has its own security built in you need to remove the “Windows Security Essentials” install that you had. Effectively Windows 8 has a newer version built-in. Security is no longer an afterthought…

    Now I can click that “Restart” button and hope for the best. Remember that I am remote required interaction with the desktop before we are back in Windows will require a painful trans-Atlantic phone call…

    …waiting…

    And we are back, but still in Windows 7. So lets login and…

    I am not sure why I had to reboot, but I am not really bothered… whatever gets the job done in the best most stable and consistent way is just fine with me…

    As soon as you click the “Install” button you are handing control over to the Windows 8 installation procedures.

    **Figure: Windows 8 Installation**

    My hope is that once the install and reboots have completed that Team Viewer will just come back up and I will be able to log striate in. I have the latest version Team Viewer that support Windows 8 so it is not a forlorn hope, but I do think that I am being overly hopeful.

    I should at this point point out that this is the first ever upgrade of one version of Windows that I have ever done for another. I got out of the habit in the Windows 95/98/ME and Windows 2000/XP days and never looked back until now. If this just works it will be a perfect experience for updating remote computers of family members…

    **Figure: About 20 minutes in**

    I would expect an upgrade to take substantially longer to facilitate than a pure install. I am about 20 minutes into the install and we are 85% into the current process. Hopefully it will get all the way through before my parents go to bed ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile3-17-17.png) (its 21:50 GMT back home).

    The first thing that you need to do is check for updates and validate that all of your hardware is still working…

    … Now to get her some apps, uninstall office 2007 in favour of Office 365 Preview…

    If you say my post on “TFS Integration Tools - Issue: TF10141 No Files checked in as a result of a TFS check-in failure” which I just updated you will know that I messed up the conflict resolution by mixing up the “Source Version” and “Target Version”.

    [![image](images/image_thumb77-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image77.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Mixing up the Source and Target context**

    Because the context we are talking here is the Conflict and not the Migration the Source Version represents the source of the conflict. Which in this case, as we are completing a checkin is the Migration Target.

    > The source is the "Source Version" is the "Migration Target" and the "Target Version" is the "Migration Source". wtf! … WTF!  
    > \-MrHinsh upon realisation

    So what is the result and how come I realised. Well, after resolving this conflict I re-ran the migration with my figures crossed (did I mention that this was 14 hours into a 14hour migration) and then.. bang…

    [![image](images/image_thumb78-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image78.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Conflict after conflict after conflict…**

    So now I have ~80 VC Namespace Conflicts and ~40 VC Content Conflicts…

    [![image](images/image_thumb79-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image79.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: My ineptitude results in many more conflicts**

    Now I need to figure out to solve the problem so I am turning to the experts…

    After talking at length with [Jameson Miller](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jameson-miller/11/90a/257), Bill Essary, [Taylor Lafrinere](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/taylaf/), [Curtis Pettit](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/curtisp/) (you need to post more) & [Bill Barnett](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/billbar/)  from Microsoft’s Developer Division and experts on the TFS Integration Tools with some log spelunking thrown in we have an answer.

    Because I horked up conflict resolution rule all changes after I entered it are in a conflicted state. So “all” I have to do is undo the rule which will get the TFS Integration Platform to refresh and re-analyse its list of pending changes and I should get back to the original conflict.

    [![image](images/image_thumb80-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image80.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Messed up rules to be deleted**

    Once I have deleted the offending rules I should be able to “Start” the current migration again and hopefully get back to a state before I messed up the Source / Target things… Aw… dang it…

    [![image](images/image_thumb81-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image81.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Nope, no dice with the restart**

    There is only one last forlorn hope, from [TFS Integration Platform – I have just moved my VC content, now I want to sync from a specific snapshot … now what?](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2010/03/16/tfs-integration-platform-i-have-just-moved-my-vc-content-now-i-want-to-sync-from-a-specific-snapshot-now-what.aspx) that will allow me to create a brand new session, but have it start from Migration Source checkin 11783 and Migration Target checkin 25308 in the target path.

    **Figure: New config.. note the Shapshot data**

    With the snapshots added to the config we should be good to go… cross your fingers and hope…

    [![image](images/image_thumb82-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image82.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Looks ok so far.**

    It looks like the Integration Platform is running through its usual and skipping over all of the items before the snapshot. I will not know if it worked until it gets all the way to the end as I only have about 90 changes left to come across…

    [![image](images/image_thumb83-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image83.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Arg… nuts…**

    Now what, it was supposed to start at 11784 (11783+1) but I don’t know what to do with this strange beast… but after some more confab it looks like it is simply the TFS Integration Tools saying “I did not migrate this! Which changeset is it in the target system?”

    If that is the case, then the answer is 25308!

    [![image](images/image_thumb84-8-8.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image84.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: There is no going back now**

    And it looks like this was the right choice. I have no idea if it will finish the Migration, but I am now on 25308+1 as it has skipped the mirrored changeset.

    [![image](images/image_thumb85-9-9.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image85.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Woot it is now re-analysing…**

    Wooohooooo…

    **Figure: All of the left over changesets have been migrated**

    And thus the padawan becomes the master… or at least… erm… more competent!

    According to [TFS Integration Tools – March 2012 Release](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2012/03/20/tfs-integration-tools-march-2012-release.aspx) there was a fix for “Resolving VC namespace conflicts results in System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no elements” in the March release. I am using the March release and:

    Figure: Sequence contains no elements

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools (March 2012 Release)

    ### Findings

    On examining the log files it looks like the Migration Shell is trying to load the TFS 2008 VC Adapter even though we are using the TFS 2012 VS Adapter. As I do not have anything to do with TFS 2008 installed I get, as you would expect, an “Unable to load one or more of the requested types”.

    Well that sucks…

    ### Workaround

    One work around that I found with the help of [Bill Essary](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2011/06/03/visual-studio-alm-rangers-champion-awards.aspx) is to remove the “Tfs2008VCAdapter.dll” files from the folder so that they can’t even be loaded.

    [![image](images/image_thumb65-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image65.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Get rid of the offending adapters**

    1. Create new folder called “NOT NEEDED” under “C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration ToolsPlugins”
    2. Move all files from “Plugins” that have 2008 in the title to this folder.
    3. Rerun action…

    **Woot… that solved my issue… did it solve yours?**

    If you encounter a TFS check-in failure conflict type and you try the first option of “Retry the action”.

    **Figure: This conflict is generated during the final checkin.**

    The migration exists and you are left with some Purple columns in the UI.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Nice green UI covered with purple crap**

    This is followed by a strong sinking feeling after 14 hours of babysitting the migration… there are only 96 items left to go…

    - **Update 2012-08-22** – I messed up on the final dialog… thanks to [Jameson Miller](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jameson-miller/11/90a/257) for spotting this one.

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools (March 2012 Release)

    ### Findings

    Your first thought will be to click “Start” and run the migration again and it tells you that there are 96 items to be migrated.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Its going… its going…**

    After which you will be greeted with a “your migration was successful”, but don’t be fooled. This migration…. it is lying to you…

    You need to look at the logs now, and low and behold:

    > Checkin failed - TF14080: The item '$/XXX XXXX/XXX/Version4_0-Next_Build/XXXAdmin/App_WebReferences/XXXXXXXWCF/Reference.svcmap' has a pending merge / rollback conflict, run resolve before checking in.

    To start moving forward we need to move back… delete the rule (“View Conflicts | View Rules”) and click “Start” again.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Delete this rule that you just added**

    And we end up back at the conflict resolution screen, but now armed with the knowledge that “Retry this action” is not going to work.

    **Figure: See… back to the start…**

    Now we need to specifically solve the problem and this problem is a gnarly one. We need to look at what is currently pending in TFS.

    Now while you can do this from the command line that is something that I am not comfortable with (sorry… not old enough ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile2-13-13.png)) but I can open TFS under that user account and resolve the conflict…

    If like me you are command line adverse, then you can install the Team Foundation Sidekicks along with the TFS 2010 API and gain access to the data that you are looking for. In this case it also tells me the Workspace that I need to load…

    **Figure: Load the offending workspace**

    Now we need to figure out the problem. To do that we need to look at the offending change and manually resolve the conflicts.

    **Figure: Woops they are not the same**

    This is an issue as the change from the original files is not replicated correctly. This could indeed be a big in TFS, the TFS Integration Platform or both but that small comfort does not help me now…

    ### Solution

    To move past this we need to manually resolve the conflicts and check-in. We can then take the original source check-in and along with the new target changeset resolve the conflict in the Integration Platform.

    **Figure: Resolution causes TF14092**

    Attempting to resolve the conflict in favour of the source by clicking “Take Source Branch Version” runs into the same problem that the TFS Integration Platform likely ran into when it was trying to achieve the same result.

    > Resolution causes TF14092: The item $/XXX/ cannot be changed. A parent of this item has a pending delete which must be checked in first.

    This to me looks like it was because of the order that VC committed items  in TFS 2008 and how it is now committed in TFS 2012. If that is the case then the argument for which service the bug is in could be made either way…

    However clicking “Take Target Brach Version” results in a successful merge but will leave those files in source control after the operation. I can however keep track of this additive data and resolve it permanently by deleting them as part of a clean up at the end..

    **Figure: Use the following changesets for the source and target system**

    Now that I have manually resolved the issue I can go back to my conflict in the TFS Integration Platform and manually wire up the source check-in to the target one that I just manually checked in…

    <warning>

    In the context of this Conflict the Source does not refer to the Migration Source as you would think. It relates to the Source of the Conflict instead and in this case it is the “Migration Target”. So the source is the Migration Target and the Target is the Migration Source… and are we confused yet, coz I was!

    Reference: [TFS Integration Tools – VC Conflict “A namespace conflict has been detected” … what now?](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2012/04/10/tfs-integration-tools-vc-conflict-a-namespace-conflict-has-been-detected-what-now.aspx)

    After Jameson pointed this out to me I was muttering like a Pirate that has stubbed his toes for at least an hour…

    You get error “TF205022: The following path contains more than the allowed 259 characters” when trying to migrate over some folders.

    ```
    TF205022: The following path contains more than the allowed 259 characters:

    $/XXX XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX/Image Source Files/Promotions/SixZero/XXX

    and images for localization/Promo XX XXXXXXX Ad Banner and Badge/675x180_XXXXXXX
    ads/XXXXXXX_675x180.jpg.

    Specify a shorter path.

    ```

    **Figure: OMG that's 264**

    You can't make this stuff up!

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Platform

    ### Findings

    The mapped path for the destination TFS server is a might too long. In this case it is 264 (use [http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/charcount.shtml](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/charcount.shtml) rather than counting manually) and that is just too long for getting data into TFS.

    If you end up in this position then you are looking at a manual intervention to fix. Folks that are using these folders can map them at a lower level and you can indeed do that with the Integration Plafrom and achieve the same result. However, you will be left in the same place as they currently are.

    1. Perform manual mappings of each folder that is causing problems
    2. Manually go a get, clean and checkin.

    I am opting for #1 as it maintains my branching and history but the ultimate solution would be to think long and hard about the folder structure that you check into TFS. Its not just a network share and it comes with its own requirements.

    ### Solution #0

    By default the TFS Integration Platform uses “x:TfsIpData” for its workspaces. To gain a few much needed characters you can change this to “x:ipw”.

    1. Open “C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration Tools”
    2. Edit “MigrationToolServers.config” as Admin
    3. Edit the AppSettings Value for Key “WorkSpaceRoot”

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Alter the AppSettings Key**

    Now you have saved a few characters! Its not enough for me, but may be for you…

    ### Solution #1

    You will need to setup your mappings so that the target is shorter for all folders that end up longer. As you map all of the source and targets or the branches to the new shorter names the merge/branch history is still preserved.

    In this case I want to rip out “XX XXXXXXX web content, banner ads, and images for localization” (63) and replace it with “ContentForLocalization”( 22) which will free up 41 characters for the path. If I also shorten “XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX” to “XXX” I get another 16 characters and that I think puts me back into a safe place.

    **Figure: Shorten the path in the config**

    Now that the path has been shortened the Integration Platform should detect that the config has changed and reset the migration data. The problem is that these errors can be resolved due to a “Sequence contains no matching elements” error.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Sequence contains no matching elements**

    In order to proceed I will need to again recreate the session. Remembering to call “tf destroy” on the source that has already been migrated.

    **Did this help you save a few characters from your path?**

    If you are moving source from one team project to another (I am doing a migration of Source Code from “TeamProjectA” to “TeamProjectBTeamProjectA” in the same collection) you can get a TF14009 if there is a bad check-in in TFS from a previous version. In this case  a folder was branched from itself into a sub folder.

    **Figure: Error log of TF14009**

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Platform
    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server (from TFS 2008 upgrade)

    ### Findings

    Looking at the actual check-in it looks like both a Branch and an Add was performed at the same time in TFS 2008. This may have been Pre-SP1 where many of these issues were fixed, but it is still biting me now.

    [![image](images/image_thumb57-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image57.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Changeset and Branch relationships**

    There does not seams to be an easy solution to this one…

    It appears that the customer was a able to pended the new branch and renamed the source branch in the same changeset! This should have been caught by TFS’s internal checks that guard against  getting the system into this state. The Integration Platform may be trying to perform these actions in a different order and thus hitting the TFS 2012 rules.

    As the system should not be able to get into this state, I am not sure we want to try and force this branch to be migrated to the target server the same way it is on the source server.

    Depending on the requirements of the migration, we could try to:

    1. Cloak this path from this particular migration session
    2. Destroy the problem branch (if it is a dead branch, that was not used, for instance)
    3. Attempt to have the migration tool pend the changes in a different order to get the check-in by TFS (target system would then have this unexpected state)

    I would not recommend #3, and #2 removes the data from the Source system. In this case I would go with #1.

    ### Workaround #1

    You can change the mappings while the migration is running by manually changing the XML. The UI will not let you do it as this is an advanced option but if you go to “Edit Current | Xml” you can add the mapping manually.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Manually adding a cloak to a run**

    Find your filter pair mappings and add one for that path that says Neglect=”true”.  Once you swap back to the “Form” tab you should see the new mapping and when you restart the migration the engine will detect the configuration change and will flush all pending migration instructions.

    However in my case we had gone too far down the “Resolve” route and we needed to start over. To do that you need to call “tf destroy” to remove the half migrated data from source control and then create a new run with the Cloak already added.

    [![image](images/image_thumb59-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image59.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: UI with the Cloak added**

    Run again and you will then get your source across. If you want you can then manually move that cloaked folder to complete the data and with it no longer being a branch, our target system is then in a working state.

    If for some reason you need to re-install SharePoint 2010 as part of your TFS deployment you may get a “TF250052: Grant access rights already exists for the following Team Foundation Server URL: [http://tfs01:8080/tfs](http://tfs01:8080/tfs). You should modify the existing access” but you don’t see anything in the existing list!

    - SharePoint 2010
    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    Although it is not displayed the previous listing is still there. If you click “Refresh” at the top of the window it will magically appear..

    ### Solution

    Just click “OK” and then “Cancel”. Your display will then refresh with the entry listed! Phew..

    - Team Foundation Service (2012-7 only)
    - Visual Studio 2012 RC Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    There are a bunch of checks that you want to do in order to make sure that this is indeed a TFS problem and not a local one.

    - Restarting VS
    - Restarting Machine
    - Delete and recreate workspace
    - Try on multiple computers

    In all circumstances TFS thinks that the file is checked in but that I don’t yet have it locally.

    **Figure: Tfs Preview Lost a file**

    I was far more concerned with the fact that TFS can lose a file than in the file that was lost but this is a big complex system and glitches will happen. Its how they are handled that is important.

    If you find something like this then you need to contact the product team through [http://tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com).

    ### Conclusion

    I escalated this to the Product Team and after a few questions and screenshots they investigated and identified a bug in VC subsystem which under certain circumstances can result in deleting files.  Here are the technical details:

    > A call to the Upload server call in Dev11 consists of three database calls. Version control is the orchestrator of the operation and it controls these three steps. Steps 1 and 3 are VC steps. Step 2 is owned by the file service.
    >
    > 1. Pre-upload (prc_PreUploadFile) – checks to make sure the server item ($/…) for which the user is calling is eligible for upload (existence check, etc.)
    > 2. Upload – this phase is delegated to the file service. At the end of this call, the row in tbl_File is created and its OwnerId is set to 1.
    > 3. Post-upload (prc_PostUploadFile). The row for this item in tbl_PendingChange is modified to get the FileId for the row in tbl_File.
    >
    > There is no overarching transaction for these three steps. If prc_DeleteUnusedContent runs between steps 2 and 3 above then it will garbage collect the file ID it just created because it appears the file ID is unrooted in VC.
    >
    > I applied a temporary mitigation to your account through which you should be able to access the file.  Can you please re-try accessing the file and let me know if you still are able to repro the issue now?
    >
    > We already ported a fix into RTM & will be working on deploying a hotfix to the service on Friday or Monday.  
    > \-Madhu Kavikondala

    This had now been fixed not just for me, but across both the hosted service and for the TFS 2012 RTM ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-5-5.png)

    After an upgrade from TFS 2008 you are unable to edit permissions even though you are part of the appropriate groups. In this case it is an upgrade from TFS 2008 to TFS 2012 that did not have any errors on the way through. Everything looked like it worked, but…

    [Updated 2012-10-11](#collapseOne) \- Solution improvement for additional circumstances

    I found that the solution below did not always do the job and I had to add a second command line to make it work. Effectively adding an additional ACL to the logged in user if they are not in the Project Administrator list.

    You get an “Unable to remove the selected identity from this group” error when trying to remove someone from contributors.

    [![image](images/image_thumb50-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image50.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Unable to delete user from group**

    ### Applies To

    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    You need to make sure that you are in the appropriate groups first. This could be simply a case of not actually having permission.

    1. I am in the Administration Console Users list… (yes I reapplied)[  
        ![image](images/image_thumb51-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image51.png)  
       { .post-img }
       **Figure: Administration Console User List**
    2. I am in the Team Foundation Server Administrators group…[  
        ![image](images/image_thumb52-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image52.png)  
       { .post-img }
       **Figure: Team Foundation Server Administrators**
    3. I am in the Project Collection Administrators group…[![image](images/image_thumb53-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image53.png)  
       { .post-img }
       **Figure: Project Collection Administrators**

    If you have checked all of the permissions then we have a problem. Log in as the “TFS Service” account that you are using and see if you still can’t change things.

    Now I can delete users from the Contributors group, woot… but why can’t other accounts that are administrators.

    ### Solution

    You need to add the permissions that you need as they were not part of the upgrade. To do this you need to call TFS Security and this is where things get a little complicated.

    ```
    tfssecurity.exe /a+ Identity vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/PROJECT_GUID
            ManageMembership adm:vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/PROJECT_GUID ALLOW
            /collection:http://tfsserver01:8080/tfs/Tfs01

    tfssecurity.exe /a+ Identity vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/PROJECT_GUID
            ManageMembership domainusername ALLOW
            /collection:http://tfsserver01:8080/tfs/Tfs01

    ```

    **Figure: Command to add the missing security**

    In order to call TFS Security to add permissions to the Project Administrators group for the Team Project you need the Team Project GUID. Now in Visual Studio 2010 you can just right-click on the project node and you will see the GUID in the properties. But what if, like me, you don’t have 2010 to hand…

    If you connect to the TFS Server and view the tbl_project table in the Collection you will see the Project Uri, which contains the GUID.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Finding the Project GUID**

    Now that you have the GUID for the Team Project you can execute the command above to add the missing ability to Modify Membership back into TFS.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adding the missing security**

    Hopefully there will be a better way to get the Team Project GUID once the RTM version of the Power Tools becomes available and that there will be a hotfix for this annoying bug in the upgrade.

    With the availability of [Visual Studio 2012 RTM today on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio/) I wanted to let you know that Northwest Cadence just completed its first Production RTM installation for a customer.

    Do not fear this upgrade. If you are moving from TFS 2010 this is a simple upgrade although there are many new features and a brand new Web UI. Even from TFS 2008 this is a fairly straight forward and well documented process.

    [![image](images/image_thumb47-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image47.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: New Web Access for Team Foundation Server**

    If your organisation relies heavily on the Web UI provided by Team Web Access, and your teams are not highly adaptable,  then you may want to take a look and think about some training before you roll it out as it looks and operates very differently.

    In addition while it will work out-of-the-box you may want to think about [how your Team Projects are structured](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/one-team-project/) and how your Teams will interact with them.

    ### Experiences installing Visual Studio 2012 BETA

    [![VS11-Beta_h_rgb](images/VS11-Beta_h_rgb_thumb-5-5.png "VS11-Beta_h_rgb")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/VS11-Beta_h_rgb.png)
    { .post-img }

    Even the Beta release came with a go-live licence and while this provided full support from Microsoft we only had one customer take up the Beta mantel and they moved to the Team Foundation Service Preview and not an on-premises install.

    - [Upgrading from TFS2010 to Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server in production](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-from-tfs2010-to-visual-studio-11-team-foundation-server-in-production/) (Northwest Cadence)

    - [Upgrade to Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Service – Done](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrade-to-visual-studio-11-team-foundation-service-done/) (Customer)

    Moving to the Beta was a leap of faith, but it paid off for anyone that tried it…

    ### Experiences installing Visual Studio 2012 RC

    [![vsip-logo-2012](images/vsip-logo-2012_thumb1-6-6.png "vsip-logo-2012")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/vsip-logo-20121.png)
    { .post-img }

    The RC was provided with a go-live licence as well and many of our customers took advantage of it. Here are the documented scenarios within which I participated although it does not represent all of the installs that Northwest Cadence completed.

    - [Upgrading TFS 2010 to TFS 2012 with VSS Migration and Process Template consolidation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-with-vss-migration-and-process-template-consolidation/) (Customer)

    - [Installing TFS 2012 with Lab Management 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-with-lab-management-2012/) (Customer)

    - [Presenting Visual Studio ALM and upgrading TFS 2010 to TFS 2012 in production – Done](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/presenting-visual-studio-alm-upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-in-production-done/) (Customer)

    - [Installing TFS 2012 on Server 2012 with SQL 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-on-server-2012-with-sql-2012/) (just for me)

    - [Installing Eclipse on Windows 8 and connecting to TFS 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-eclipse-on-windows-8-and-connecting-to-tfs-2012/) (just for me)

    Moving from the RC to the RTM will be as easy as running the new install and having the upgrade take place automatically. Simples…

    ### Issues

    [![puzzle-issue-problem-128-link](images/puzzle-issue-problem-128-link_thumb-4-4.png "puzzle-issue-problem-128-link")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/puzzle-issue-problem-128-link.png)
    { .post-img }

    While I had very few issues while installing, configuring and upgrading to Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server you can never get away without having at least some issues. Here are the main things that I documented:

    - [Office 2013 Issue: Installing Office 2013 breaks Visual Studio 2012](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/office-2013-issue-installing-office-2013-breaks-visual-studio-2012/)

    - [TFS Integration Tools: TF237165: The Team Foundation Server could not update the work item](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-integration-tools-tf237165-the-team-foundation-server-could-not-update-the-work-item/)

    - [VSS Converter – Issue: TF54000: Cannot update the data because the server clock may have been set incorrectly](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/vss-converter-issue-tf54000-cannot-update-the-data-because-the-server-clock-may-have-been-set-incorrectly/)

    - [VSS Converter – Issue: TF60014 & TF60087: Failed to initialise user mapper](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/vss-converter-issue-tf60014-tf60087-failed-to-initialise-user-mapper/)

    ### Conclusion

    If you are currently running any version of Team Foundation Server you should be looking at upgrading as soon as possible to take advantage of the awesome new features.

    **Figure: New feature for continuous value delivery**

    Forget the unbelievably cool features that made it into TFS 2010, these are the cool features that you have been waiting for:

    - PowerPoint Storyboarding
    - Agile Planning
    - Suspend & Resume
    - Code Reviews
    - Feedback Collection
    - Unit Testing
    - Exploratory Testing
    - Continuous Integrations
    - Continuous Deployments
    - SCOM Integration
    - IntelliTrace in Production
    - PreEmptive Analytics

    With all of these things built into the product there is even fewer excuses for Development Teams to be unable to deliver high quality product within an agile process that provides value to the customer…

    ### ![](images/metro-findings-label-4-4.png)Findings

    { .post-img }

    Only accounts in the Team Foundation Service Accounts are aloud to access the web services directly. By default the account used to install TFS is not added to this group.

    In addition you will also be unable to add the account through the UI as editing this group directly is disables. It is meant to be used under the covers for Lab or Build accounts, but the TFS Integration Platform is not an out-of-the-box tool.

    [![clip_image002](images/clip_image002_thumb-1-1.jpg "clip_image002")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/clip_image002.jpg)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You can’t edit Team Foundation Service Accounts**

    This is a special group that does not allow you to populate it through the UI. You can however view it and all of the accounts that you use for your Build Agents, Build Controllers and other bits and bobs will all be in this list already.

    You need to use the the command line ![Sad smile](images/wlEmoticon-sadsmile-7-7.png)

    ### ![](images/metro-solution-label-6-6.png)Solution

    { .post-img }

    Use the tfssecurity.exe tool to update the Service Accounts Group and add the “TfsAdmin”.

    **Figure: Updating the TFS Security group**

    You use our old friend the command line. There is an application called TfsSecurity that will allow you to add an account directly to that group.

    ```
    tfssecurity /g+ "Team Foundation Service Accounts" n:domainusername ALLOW /server:http://myserver:8080/tfs

    ```

    Now you have that sorted you are ready to rock…

    The first time you log into TFS 2012 you may see the message “Some features of Team Web Access are not visible to you” and once you check out the details you see that “In order to use all the features of Team Web Access, you must have the correct license and configuration. For more information”.

    **Figure: Where are my features?**

    ### Applies to

    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server

    ### Findings

    Just because you are an administrator does not mean that you have access to all of the features. Features require licences and licences require money. All you need to administer TFS is a CAL (~$300), but some features require Premium (~$5000) or even Ultimate (~$12,000) MSDN licences so don’t expect it. There are a few features that only exist in the higher SKU’s and there are three levels:

    - **Limited**
      - View My Work Items
    - **Standard**
      - View My Work Items
      - Standard Features
      - Agile Boards
    - **Full**
      - View My Work Items
      - Standard Features
      - Agile Boards
      - Backlog and Sprint Planning Tools
      - Request and Manage Feedback

    Some of these are only available through the site and the site does not know what MSDN licence you have bought.

    ### Solution

    You need to add individuals to the Licence groups that relate to the respective licencing level that they have purchased.

    **Figure: Go to Administer Server**

    Open the Admin system and change the Web Access Permissions from “Control Panel | Web Access | Full | Add…” and add the users that have Premium or Ultimate licences to that group.

    **Figure: Add Premium and Ultimate user to Full feature access**

    If you are sure that you have Premium, Ultimate or Test Professional for all of your users you can just set “Full” access as the default!

    **Figure: You can also Set as default**

    If you are going to do this you need to make sure that you have licences, but it will make an administrators life a little easier!

    When configuring SharePoint 2013 in “Complete” mode you get a “The username is invalid. The account mist be a valid domain account” when using a local account to configure the farm…

    [![image_thumb[15]](images/image_thumb15_thumb-1-1.png "image_thumb[15]")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image_thumb151.png)

    **Figure: You need a domain to create a farm**

    The implication is that only Domains are supported.

    ### Applies To

    - SharePoint 2013

    ### Findings

    Out of the box SharePoint only supports “Stand-alone” mode for non domain environments, but this forces you to use SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Edition which is most cases is unacceptable.

    [![image](images/image_thumb16-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image17.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: “Stand-alone” used SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Edition**

    The UI is designed for the happy path and you need to drop to the command line to do anything else.

    ### Solution

    Use a PowerShell command to create the initial configuration of the farm with a local account:

    1.  **Start the SharePoint PowerShell**
    2.  **Run “New-SPConfigurationDatabase” from the command line and follow the instructions**
        [![image_thumb[16]](images/image_thumb16_thumb-2-2.png "image_thumb[16]")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image_thumb161.png)
        { .post-img }
        Figure: New-SPConfigurationDatabase creates the farm for you
        This will create the farm and configure the necessary accounts.
    3.  **Rerun the Configurtion wizard**
        After it finishes start the Config Wizard (interactive or not) and configure your server with all components

    This works just fine with SQL Server 2012.

    Any setup of Team Foundation Server is not complete until you have at least tried t work with SharePoint. While I have many customers that like to stay away from  SharePoint I also have many that make it an integral part of not just their TFS install, but their corporate network, offerings and culture.

    note: To really use SharePoint effectively you have to buy into it as “the” solution or your internal network.

    > The questions is irrelevant, the answer is SharePoint
    >
    > \-[Adam Cogan](http://www.adamcogan.com/)

    SharePoint 2013 Preview is fully supported by Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server, but I do not know what the Office teams take on Go-Live or actually using SharePoint 2013 is.

    **Figure: SharePoint Server 2013 Preview**

    I have been using Office 2013 for a while and it is fairly solid. I have some high hopes for the interaction as there are some major advances in the new SharePoint.

    **Figure: Install software prerequisites**

    There was always a lot of… trial and error… in finding and installing the prerequisites for SharePoint in the past and as of SharePoint 2010 you have an option on the Installation wizard to have it all done for you.

    I heartily recommend that approach…

    **Figure: Always run Windows Update**

    It may seam like a small thing, but make sure that you run Windows Update both before and after each installation. There may be critical updates that would make your install process as slick as possible. Also if you rely on your organisation to manage windows updates then make sure that your System Administrators have approved all of the updates that you might need. Ask them to approve all updates for:

    - **Office 2013**
    - **Windows 2012**
    - **SQL Server 2012**
    - **SQL Server 2008 R2**  
       There are some dependencies in there for 2008 R2 components
    - **Visual Studio 2012**

    Its a long list, but lacking a windows update can make you life incredibly painful with often little understanding as to why.

    **Figure: Make sure that you restart**

    Most of the new generation of Microsoft products do as much auto detection of potential problems before they become a problem. How well they do depends on the product team, but so far SharePoint 2013 is doing ok.

    Everyone makes this mistake once so please take note… never… ever… select “Stand-alone” install option. You will not be asked to select a SQL server is it will automatically install and use Express.

    If you don’t see this screen next you need to uninstall SharePoint and re-install selecting “Complete” as the install mode. Like I said, everyone makes that mistake once.

    Fudge buckets! I want to configure it myself and I do not want to use SQL Express, so what to-do! So getting a “The username is invalid. The account mist be a valid domain account” is very frustrating… in 2010 the message was “Local accounts should only be used in standalone mode” and was equally annoying… don’t tell me how to install… I will tell you.

    Command line to the rescue! You need to [run “New-SPConfigurationDatabase” from the PowerShell command line](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/issue-sharepoint-2013-the-username-is-invalid-the-account-must-be-a-valid-domain-account) to configure with local accounts.

    After that small interlude we can now carry on with the configuration to get SharePoint 2013 up and running on my local VM.

    [Info   @22:29:03.647] Verifying SQL login of account KRAKENAdministrator does not exist on Kraken, or if it exists, it does not have a different SID and it is not denied access to the server.
    [Info   @22:29:03.694] Node returned: Error
    [Error  @22:29:03.694] TF255507: The security identifier (SID) for the following SQL Server login conflicts with a specified domain or workgroup account: WIN-EO45N4FNSOCAdministrator. The domain or workgroup account is: KRAKENAdministrator.  The server selected to host the databases for Team Foundation Server is: Kraken.
    You can resolve this issue by renaming the conflicting login. To do so, open a command prompt on the computer that is running SQL Server and execute the following command:
    sqlcmd -E -S "Kraken" -Q "ALTER LOGIN [WIN-EO45N4FNSOCAdministrator] WITH NAME = [KRAKENAdministrator]"
    For more information, see the following page on the Microsoft Web site: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=183408

    ```

    **Figure: Error from log**

    ### Applies To

    - Team Foundation Server 2012
    - SQL Server 2012

    ### Findings

    It looks like the Server was renamed after the install of SQL Server 2012. The original generated name was “WIN-EO45N4FNSOC” and it was subsequently renamed to “KRAKEN”.

    ### Solution 1

    Rename your server before you install SQL.

    ### Solution 2

    As specified in the error message you need to run the SQL Command to fix. Alternatively you could just remove and add the correct account. However altering the account will maintain any audit trail.

    ```
    sqlcmd -E -S "Kraken" -Q "ALTER LOGIN [WIN-EO45N4FNSOCAdministrator] WITH NAME = [KRAKENAdministrator]"

    ```

    Once you have run the command you can “rerun Readiness Checks” to clear out the error.

    Today I saw a demonstration by [ITR Mobility](http://itr-mobility.com/) of their line of business application support for having one code base, written in C# that can be deployed to practically any platform you like. Does that should like it would be of use to you? Coz it sure as hell sounds like I could use it. I want to build an app… but I want to build in Visual Studio and that would limit me to Windows Phone and I really don’t want to lead Objective C!

    [![image](images/image_thumb12-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image13.png)
    { .post-img }

    This solves that problem and although their marketing concentrates on mobile devices, the demo I saw showed c# running on Android, iOS, Windows and Windows CE and even on a terminal.

    There seams to be two main ways they allow you to implement :

    - **Generic UI**  
       You can let them handle the UI and define how your application should look in  a generic manor but loose the ability to use that nifty feature that only Android supports.. or…
    - **Platform Specific UI  
       **You can code specific UI logic for each platform to take advantage of the differences.  
       [![image](images/image_thumb13-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image14.png)  
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: Application Specific UI if you want**

    So if you have an application with only a few pages and lots of logic you can have full control, however if you have thousands of views to write across tens of application than you should probably think of using the more generic, but less sexy, approch to ge the job done.

    The demo that I saw showed the same application and codebase compiled and running on:

    - Windows
    - Windows Phone
    - iOS
    - iPad
    - iPhone
    - Android
    - Linux
    - Terminal

    That in its self knocked my socks off and allows for a standardisation on a single technology platform for all of your engineers for all of your applications. They also announced that they would support Windows 8 RT and Windows Phone 8 and Visual Studio 2012 within a short time of the release and they have been working with the Product Teams for a while to get that right.

    You can code everything using the features provided in Visual Studio, arguably the most powerful and easiest to use IDE; store your source in Team Foundation Server; have your application automatically built using Team Foundation Build; and then have it automatically deployed to the app store of your choice.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Building on Mac and deploy to App Store**

    From an ALM perspective this gives you a number of capabilities that you did not have before:

    - You get to have one set of trained developers who can build for any of your target platforms.
    - You now have a holistic build process leveraging a single set of technologies.
    - You can trace from a line of code written, to the requirement / bug that elicited that change in one way.
    - You can report across all of your teams and see the true effort involved in delivering your software to the customer

    http://youtu.be/lbH9rIHyCp4?hd=1

    **Figure: Video Overview and Demonstration**

    They have added a bunch of nifty framework logic to allow you to have your application running locally on a device, maybe offline, and another user working in a version deployed to Azure with full data synchronisation accross the platfomrs… amasing…

    **Figure: Building code for iOS right in Visual Studio**

    If you are a user wanting to build line of business application for your organisation and you cant get agreement on a platform then this is for you. I will be recommending this to any and all of my customers that are building in the mobile space.

    This is a demonstration of what can be done in the ALM space to solve a real need for customer and allow them to deliver more value more quickly to their customers.

    **Do you build mobile applications? Would this help you?**

    After installing Windows 8 I tried to do a couple of things that I normally do to set up my computer.

    I went to enable “Remote Desktop”… but there was no options. Hmm…

    I wanted to make a change to the “Local Security Settings…”. Hmmm…

    Both of these things were missing and I started to google bing for information on how to change a setting. And, lo and behold I found:

    > If you are troubleshooting why secpol.msc does not seem to exist in your copy of Windows 7, then the reason is probably that you have the Home Premium version; unfortunately you need to upgrade, or else try another machine that does have the Ultimate Edition.  
    > \-[Secpol: Local Security Policy Editor](http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/win8/windows8-secpol-msc.htm)

    But I have Windows 8 Pro? But no… alas I dropped the ball and installed “Windows 8”. Full stop… and not “Windows 8 Pro”…

    How do you tell? Simples…

    When you are running hyper-v you get the option to create private virtual switches to compartmentalise your network coms. if however you are using Windows 8 it may define those networks as “Public Networks” and tighten up your security so much that you cant communicate with other computers.

    **Figure: Other networks detected as Public when they are Private**

    ### Applies to

    - Windows 8

    ### Finding

    If you are using Hyper-V with Windows 8 clients then you need to set a fixed IP on your clients on Private virtual switches.

    **Figure: Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapters**

    Windows 8 detects the Hyper-V virtual network adapters as Unknown if there is no DHCP or domain identification and classifies them as “public” without the ability to change them

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Unidentified Networks are automatically public**

    ### Workaround

    Although domains should be identified correctly I want the ability to change the configuration manually if needed.

    1. _Click “Start | run | MMC | press enter”_
    2. _In MMC console “File | Add/Remove Snap-in”_
    3. _Select Group Policy Object editor  by “Add | select Local computer | OK | OK”_
    4. _Open “Computer configuration | Windows Settings | Security Settings | Network list Manager policies”_
    5. _Open “Unidentified networks”_

    Then you can select the option to consider the Unidentified networks as private and if user can change the  
    location.

    Note: If you cant launch the “Local Computer Policy” then you are running Windows 8 and you need Windows 8 Pro to do this.

    No I am not going to work at Microsoft… well I am, kind of. I have just started an engagement that will see me working as a Technical Product Manager as part of the Visual Studio Industry Partner Program.

    [![vsip-logo-2012](images/vsip-logo-2012_thumb-4-4.png "vsip-logo-2012")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/vsip-logo-2012.png)

    - [Visual Studio Industry Partner (VSIP) Program](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd637761)

    An Orange badge (or “v dash” because of the v-username format) is an external vendor consulting inside of Microsoft. The Director of the VSIP team (Tom) has tagged me to help him better leveraging and understand the space between [Microsoft Visual Studio Industry Partners](https://vsipprogram.com) and the Visual Studio product. This is an awesome opportunity to personally expand and allow the VSIP team to leverage my skills as an ALM Consultant, ALM MVP and ALM Ranger to the fullest to, hopefully, benefit both sides of this awesome sandwich.

    **Figure: Visual Studio Extensibility Map**

    My key focus will be on:

    - ### Opportunities for partners to extend Visual Studio
      There are many extensibility points in the Visual Studio stack from client to server and back again, but not all of them are being leveraged by the field. There are currently over 180+ VSIP members that are leveraging the benefits of a program designed to foster collaboration and growth of an ecosystem around Visual Studio and we want to grow that. In addition we need to understand where the partners fir, where they are going and what Microsoft can do to support them… a roadmap if you will.
    - ### Opportunities for Visual Studio to be extended
      There are many gaps in the extensibility that if this or that API was just tweaked a little we could get some awesome developer tools working. This is where I will be leasing heavily with the Product Teams for Visual Studio and Team Foundation Serve to make use that the extensibility points that the vendors want to leverage are up to par or even exist at all. This will enable Visual Studio to better support the partners and vice a versa.

    My first task was defining a new taxonomy to fit out partners into as the old one was a little too low level with “ASP.NET” and “MVC” on the list. We went with parity to the general “Define”, ‘Develop” and “Operate” strategy that will help us better understand where the VSIP partners sit and where any gaps are.

    [![image](images/image_thumb1-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image2.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: There are many places to integrate with Visual Studio**

    I am really exited about this not just as an opportunity to work more closely with the Product Team and get involved in the cool goings on in the vendor community, but also to grow as a consultant and take on new challenges. Over the last year and a half I have gone from being a Technical Consultant to a Process Consultant and Professional Scrum Trainer, and that is no easy transition  while maintaining  your technical competence. I do feel that some of my low level technical skills have dribbled out of my ears to make room for some of the other stuff, but hopefully not much.

    Now adding to that the Product Management role which is very different from those that have gone before will be the next challenge. Also balancing that on a part time basis will be even more fun…

    **Do you integrate with Visual Studio? Did it fit into the new taxonomy?**

    I have not thought about an upgrade from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 is quite a while as most if not all of my customers have already made the move to 2010. However one of my colleagues asked if I had done one recently and well… not in a while.

    There are really two main parts to any upgrade. The physical upgrade of one version of the product to another. And then the configuration within that product to make everything sing and dance.

    The hard part if the singing and dancing so lets tackle the upgrade first.

    ### #1 Upgrading from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 / TFS 2012

    Although [Brian Harry has an awesome post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2009/10/21/upgrading-from-tfs-2005-2008-to-tfs-2010.aspx) on this I wanted to pull together the experiences that I have had over the years into one place that I can reference.

    - [In-Place upgrade of TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 with move to new domain](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/in-place-upgrade-of-tfs-2008-to-tfs-2010-with-move-to-new-domain/)  
       I hate in-place upgrade and you should never do one unless you have to. There is generally no way to back out and a complete rebuild is your disaster plan. Try to use Virtual hardware and snapshots if you have to do an in-place upgrade but insist on moving to new hardware. This has the added benefit of cleaning the server and allows you to upgrade SQL and Windows easily.
    - [Upgrading Team Foundation Server 2008 to 2010](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-team-foundation-server-2008-to-2010/)  
       This was an upgrade to TFS 2010 Beta 2 in the early days of 2010. I only had one problem even way back then.
    - [Upgrading from TFS 2008 and WSS v3.0 with SfTSv2 to TFS 2010 and SF 2010 with SfTSv3](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-from-tfs-2008-and-wss-v3-0-with-sftsv2-to-tfs-2010-and-sf-2010-with-sftsv3/)  
       This was probably the largest upgrade I have been responsible for with nearly 500GB of data and servers with 24 cores ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile6-2-2.png). I will get to the process template upgrade woes later…

    - [Connecting VS2008 to any TFS2010 Project Collection](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/connecting-vs2008-to-any-tfs2010-project-collection/)  
       In addition your teams may not be upgrading visual studio at the same pace, so make sure you know what they are using other than the latest Visual Studio.

    Upgrading from 2005 to 2008 was a very painful experience. So much so that the team at Microsoft spent a lot of time and money on making the experience as slick and easy as possible. TFS 2010 upgrades are a dream and with TFS 2012 I have been speechless at the  smoothness of the upgrade experience.

    ### #2 Migrating Process Template

    Doing something with the Team Projects that you now have in the new version of the product are another matter and a much more complicated one. There are a number of ways to handle this and if you are moving to TFS 2010 then they are all manual:

    - [Upgrading from TFS 2008 and WSS v3.0 with SfTSv2 to TFS 2010 and SF 2010 with SfTSv3](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-from-tfs-2008-and-wss-v3-0-with-sftsv2-to-tfs-2010-and-sf-2010-with-sftsv3/)  
       Moving from SfTSv2 to SfTSv3 is a very painfully experience and attempt it at your pearl.
    - [Upgrading your Process Template in Team Foundation Server](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/)  
       I tried to detail as many ways of manipulating the process templates as possible, but I have settled on #7 as my de facto standard!
    - [Process Template Upgrade #3 – Destroy all Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-3-destroy-all-work-items-and-import-new-ones/)  
       This is the cleanest approach but DOES NOT retain any histiory on work item tracking data.
    - [Process Template Upgrade #7 – Rename Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-7-overwrite-retaining-history-with-limited-migration/)  
       #7 is now my recommended norm and includes

    My best [documentation of my experience of implementing #7](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-with-vss-migration-and-process-template-consolidation/) was as part of a 2010 to 2012 upgrade, but the process is the same.

    In TFS 2012 after the upgrade there is an option on a per-Team Project bases to perform and automatic enablement of the new 2012 features. While this is awesome it does not change the process template hat you are using and instead injects only the bits requires to get the new features working. And it is not available for TFS 2010!

    ### Conclusion

    A TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 upgrade takes no more than a day at the most, but the real hard work is in getting the Process Template to where it is useable for the customer. Take the time here to make and understand the choices.

    You get a “There is not enough free memory to run this program. Quit one or more programs, and try again.” when trying to do activities in Outlook 2013.

    **Figure: Can’t expand folders without an error**

    This affects both the Exchange and IMAP account when you have multiple email accounts enabled.

    **Figure: Can’t select folders without an error**

    ### Updates

    - **Updated 2012-07-27** – I found an additional workaround for my circumstance. Let me know if it helps you! (Looks like this did not work)
    - **Updated 2012-07-30** – Solution found - This has been affecting me so much that I moved back to Outlook 2010. This however did not help as I get this error with Outlook 2010 as well which helped me find a fix…
    - **Updated 2012-08-13** (Recommended)– Better solution found.. Don’t download shared or public folders

    ### Applies To

    - Outlook 2013 Preview
    - Outlook 2010

    ### Finding

    I tried everything that was available online and the only solution that worked for me was to have only one Exchange account active at a time.

    [![image](images/image_thumb40-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image40.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I don’t think I have run out of memory! I have 24GB RAM!**

    Even with separate profiles this continues to be a problem with my Microsoft Account, but not with my Office 365 account… weird. This may be an exchange issue that I am running into, but I do not know…

    [![SNAGHTMLdd97fa3](images/SNAGHTMLdd97fa3_thumb-9-9.png "SNAGHTMLdd97fa3")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/SNAGHTMLdd97fa3.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: there is not enough free memory in Outlook 2010**

    As this is happening in Outlook 2010 I looked at reported solutions there and it looks like it is due to one of my mailboxes being associated with “Public Folders” or whatever the equivalent is here. I think they are just mandatory “Mailboxes” but they present as public folders. If I remove this mailbox I get no further issues.

    ### Workaround 1

    If you create two profiles (yuch) and only open one exchange account at a time you can have a world of working instead of a world of hurt.

    [![SNAGHTML6bf9ea](images/SNAGHTML6bf9ea_thumb-8-8.png "SNAGHTML6bf9ea")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/SNAGHTML6bf9ea.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You can’t currently open more than one exchange account**

    This is a workaround as you are supposed to be able to have multiple exchange accounts open… I guess it does say “Preview” in the product name. Although I still get the problem with my Microsoft profile it is not as persistent nor as prevalent.

    ### Workaround 2

    This is a more permanent work around as it looks like unless you have your computer joined to the Microsoft corporate domain you can’s use their email reliably.

    [![image](images/image_thumb42-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image42.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Everything works now I can authenticate better**

    Now that I have joined my compute to the domain (although I am still logging in with my live id) this problem has abated.

    ### Solution 1

    To remove this issue you need to turn off “Use cached exchange mode” for this mailbox. It will be enabled by default so you will need to deliberately turn it off.

    [![image](images/image_thumb43-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image43.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The offending Tick box**

    You can do this through Outlook:

    1. “Outlook | File | Account Settings | Account Settings…”
    2. Select your mailbox and click “Change…”
    3. Take the tick out of “Use Cached Exchange Mode”
    4. Restart Outlook

    Or you can do this through the Mail settings in the control panel.

    ### Solution 2 (Recommended)

    While the above solution worked it made offline viewing of data impossible. A better solution that also stops the error is to change the setting to not allow “Download shared folders” nor “Download Public Folder Favourites” as it looks like these are the culprits.

    [![image](images/image_thumb46-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/image46.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Don’t download shared or public folders**

    You can do this through Outlook:

    1. “Outlook | File | Account Settings | Account Settings…”
    2. Select your mailbox and click “Change… | More Settings…”
    3. Take the tick out of “Download shared folders”
    4. Take the tick out of “Download Public Folder Favourites”
    5. Click “OK” and Restart Outlook

    Or you can do this through the Mail settings in the control panel.

    After installing Office 2013 on a machine with Visual Studio 2012 you get a “The procedure entry point \_Atomic_fetch_sub_4 could not be located in the dynamic link library c:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0Common7IDEdevenv.exe” error when trying to load Visual Studio 2012.

    [![clip_image001](images/clip_image001_thumb-1-1.png "clip_image001")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/clip_image001.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: \_Atomic_fetch_sub_4 exception**

    Some of my colleagues ran into this.

    ### Applies To

    - Visual Studio 2012 RC (11.0.50522.1)
    - Office 2013 Preview

    ### Finding

    This is a C++ runtime conflict between Visual Studio 2012 RC and Office 2013 Preview.

    > This update addresses incompatibility issues that are caused by installing later versions of the C++ Runtime on a machine with Visual Studio 2012 Release Candidate. The update ensures that the Visual Studio executable file loads the compatible C++ Runtime DLLs in the app-local directory instead of loading the incompatible C++ Runtime DLLs that are installed by other applications in the system-wide directories.  
    > \-[KB2703187](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2703187)

    You will not be able to run Visual Studio until you have installed a patch.

    ### Workarounds

    In order to prevent this error you should install the [July 2012 update for Visual Studio 2012 RC](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30178.) prior to installing Office 2013 Preview.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Install the July 2012 Update for Visual Studio 2012**

    If you did not install it first and you are unable to launch Visual Studio 2012 then you should [download the July 2012 update](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30178.) from the Microsoft downloads site and install it manually.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Install July 2012 Update**

    I found that this does not affect Visual Studio 2012 installs that already have a previous update on Windows 8, but does affect vanilla Release Candidate installs.

    As part of my current engagement I will be moving data from FogBugz via a custom CSV Tip Adapter for the TFS Integration Platform. This an adapter I wrote a while ago to facilitate moving data from Excel to TFS and I just ant to reuse it. The first thing I need is a development environment as I may need to tweak this ancient code.

    **Figure: Finishing up the data consolidation**

    We completed the [upgrade to TFS 2012 and consolidated Process Templates](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-with-vss-migration-and-process-template-consolidation/) and then consolidated all of the [Team Projects to a single collection](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/one-team-project-collection-to-rule-them-allconsolidating-team-projects/) and now the last part of this marathon of fun is to get all of the existing FogBugz data into TFS. We could conceivably use a simple Excel import, but this leaves us open for a nightmare of a time getting all of the state transitions through.

    ### Setting up a development environment for a custom adapter to the TFS Integration Platform

    Do not use the ranger guidance for this. That way lies pain and suffering as it assumes that you need to be able to compile the entire TFS Integration Platform. I just set up the bits I need, so what do we need. Well, first we need to install a couple of things:

    - Windows Sever 2012
    - SQL Server 2012
    - Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server
    - Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate
    - TFS Integration Platform

    [![SNAGHTML3073bc7](images/SNAGHTML3073bc7_thumb-8-8.png "SNAGHTML3073bc7")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/SNAGHTML3073bc7.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Make sure that you snapshot**

    As I always use a VM for development I get to use the power of Snapshots to keep my environments clean and working ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile4-9-9.png)
    { .post-img }

    Next you need to create a Solution and Project to hold your custom adapter. Use whatever layout that you want, but make sure that your Project has the following references:

    - Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Migration.EntityModel.dll
    - Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Migration.Toolkit.dll

    Both of which you will find in “C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration Tools”. But in order to go through a debug cycle (the TFS Integration Platform has no Unit Tests) you need to provide a little magic.

    1.  **Select "Right Click Project | Compile | Build Events"**

    2.  **Then in the post build events enter some xcopy statements**

            ```

            **Figure: Add some xcopy statements** 

        ````

    3.  Select the Debug Tab

        { .post-img }
        Figure:
    4.  **Select “Start external Program” and enter the path to the Migration Console**

        ```
        C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration ToolsMigrationConsole.exe

        ```

    5.  **Add a command line argument of the xml config file to run**
    6.  **Add a working directory**

        ```
        C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration Tools

        ```

    Now when you debug your Class Library it will open MigrationConsole.exe with the correct test configuration and attach to the process allowing you to step through your code.

    ### Configuring your customer adapter to run

    If you have configured the above steps correctly then all you need is to select the correct configuration file form the UI and it will pre-populate all of the values for you.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Select the configuration file for your adapter**

    There is some interesting code in the Configuration file to achieve this, and a way of setting the defaults.

    ```
    < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>














































































































































































































































































    ```

    **Figure: Configuration files can be very detailed**

    This file represents the data that needs to be mapped. All the CSV Adapter does is get the data into the TFS Integration Platform and the Configuration file does all of the hard work of mapping the data into TFS. If you noticed our crazy EOL and Delimiter you should also note that we have large amounts of history and description that may contain the usual delimiters so we needed something that would be unlikely to be used.

    [![image](images/image_thumb28-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image28.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: It will now list your adapter on the left hand side**

    Now that you can select the adapter we are ready to rock…

    #### Building a configuration: Mapping States

    The real advantage of this over Excel is that we can bypass the API rules and write data directly into TFS. This allows us to write data directly into a particular state even if that state does not exist. While not good is most circumstances this is invaluable when migrating data, otherwise we need to walk the work item through its states to get it to “Done” or “Closed”.

    [![image](images/image_thumb29-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image29.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Some data may need to be updated to enable saving**

    To help with this I have created a mapping file, but it is really not that easy. We need to think about a number of things as part of the mapping. What are the old States, when are the new ones and how much do they match up.

    **Figure: Mapping from State to State**

    The state mappings are the easiest to mess up so take you time with these. I like to have all of my work items in a working state, but some customers either don’t care, or cant decide what the mapping should be. Don’t get confused into adding lots of redundant states into TFS…. why you might ask?

    Well, if you change the states or the workflow for the states you are taking on a little more than just updating the states. What bout the Reporting Services reports that rely on them, or the Excel reports, or even the queries. There is a lot dependant on the states and in changing them you take on all of that maintenance…

    I am not saying that you should not change the states (when actually I am ) but you need to consider all of the ramifications.

    When importing data from another system I always have data that I would want as part of Areas & Iterations, but getting a decision on the format and mapping at the time would be pretty hard so I tend to prefix all Areas and Iterations with the name of the system that I am pulling the data from. The customer can then move and rearrange after the fact.

    **Figure: Aggregate fields**

    To achieve this you can use the Aggregate fields function and merge one or more fields. They even support mappings as well so that you can do some clean-up or manipulation as you go through.

    ### Exporting FogBugz data to CSV

    This turned out to be a case of SQL Jujitzu and even better, I did not have to do it. My client provided me with a complete CSV file with a custom delimiter so that I could import it into TFS.

    I did have to do a bunch of changes to my CSV adapter as I had not really got it working before. Now that it is working it will work for any tabular delimited data to import. Remembering that it is a Tip adapter and does not directly import history however it is aware of changes. If you write an updated file where the “DeltaDateColumn” field has been modified the data for that Work Item will be reapplied over the top of the old one (yes it will overwrite any changes), but this does allow for a staged migration.

    Something that we have been doing is some data transformation as part of the output. We have effectively created a temporary table to hold the data and loaded and manipulated the data into that format for export to CSV, but you can just do a data dump depending on your requirements…

    **Importing Hierarchy**

    The CSV Adapter by default does not support hierarchy. It could, but I have not investigated that part of the TFS Integration Platform so I just wrote a small command line utility to do the import from a CSV.

    ```
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Connecting to {0}", args[0]));
    TfsTeamProjectCollection tfs = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri(args[0]));

    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Loading {0}", @"c:tempParentChild.csv"));
    StreamReader SR = new StreamReader(@"c:tempParentChild.csv");
    Dictionary> relates = new Dictionary>();
    while (!SR.EndOfStream)
    {
        string rowstring = SR.ReadLine();
        string[] row = rowstring.Split(',');
        if (!relates.ContainsKey(int.Parse(row[1])))
        {
            relates.Add(int.Parse(row[1]), new List());
        }
        relates[int.Parse(row[1])].Add(int.Parse(row[0]));
    }

    WorkItemStore store = tfs.GetService();
    WorkItemCollection wic = store.Query(@"SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'TestProject2FogBugz' ORDER BY [System.Id]");
    foreach (WorkItem sourcew in wic)
    {
        // TASKS
        if (sourcew.Type.Name == "Task")
        {
            decimal parent = decimal.Parse((string)sourcew.Fields["TfsMigrationTool.ReflectedWorkItemId"].Value);
            parent = decimal.Negate(parent);

            WorkItem parentw = store.Query(string.Format(@"SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [TfsMigrationTool.ReflectedWorkItemId] = '{0}' ORDER BY [System.Id]", parent))[0];
            parentw.Open();

            WorkItemLinkTypeEnd linkTypeEnd = store.WorkItemLinkTypes.LinkTypeEnds["Child"];
            parentw.Links.Add(new RelatedLink(linkTypeEnd, sourcew.Id));
            parentw.Save();

            Console.WriteLine(parent);
        }
        else
        {
            int parentIsMe = int.Parse((string)sourcew.Fields["TfsMigrationTool.ReflectedWorkItemId"].Value);
            sourcew.Open();
            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Processing Parent {0}", parentIsMe));
            if (relates.ContainsKey(parentIsMe))
            {
                foreach (int child in relates[parentIsMe])
                {
                    WorkItem childw = store.Query(string.Format(@"SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItems WHERE [TfsMigrationTool.ReflectedWorkItemId] = '{0}' ORDER BY [System.Id]", child))[0];
                    childw.Open();

                    WorkItemLinkTypeEnd linkTypeEnd = store.WorkItemLinkTypes.LinkTypeEnds["Child"];
                    sourcew.Links.Add(new RelatedLink(linkTypeEnd, childw.Id));
                    sourcew.Save();
                    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Adding child if {0} to {1}", childw.Id, parentIsMe));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    Console.ReadKey();
    ```

    **Figure: Crude but effective**

    For the most part you don’t even need to know the project name as its all in the ID’s.

    ### Importing the ForgBugz data into TFS

    This is the easiest part now that we have our data format and our configuration but we still had a nightmare getting the TFS Integration Platform to recognise the new Adapter. You need to make sure that you restart the “Windows Service” if you have it running but other than that everything went smoothly.

    Practice makes perfect ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile4-9-9.png)

    If you have not already seen the Office 2013 Preview has been made available on MSDN and on the Microsoft site. The install is ridiculously easy and includes Outlook 2013, Word 2013 and Communicator 2013. These tend to be the only parts of Office that I use, unless I an connecting to work item tracking in which case I would add Excel 2013 to that list.

    **Figure: The install is uncomplicated**

    I tend to always click “customize” if for nothing else to see the options that are available. I do also always install everything if I can. Office defaults to “not quite everything” as most folks don’t need the development tools, but I like to have them.

    **Figure: Sending feedback Office 2013 style**

    This is a fantastic feature that is akin to the “Feedback” capability built into Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server. While I di not think that the Office team currently use TFS (they have a lot of code and work items to migrate) you could build a form just like this to submit feedback  into TFS for your application…hmmm… that's an idea for an app.

    Watch out for:

    I love the new feature of Office 2013 and its the spit and polish that makes me most happy.. yea Outlook still freezes (I submitted feedback for that) and they messed up my folders (submitted feedback for that too) in Outlook, but I have more nice things to say then not.

    While running an integration platform import you get a “TF237165: The Team Foundation Server could not update the work item because of a validation error on the server. This may happen because the work item has been modified or destroyed, or that you do not have permission to update that work item.”

    **Figure: TF237165: The Team Foundation Server could not update the work item**

    Unfortunately it does not tell you what it was trying to save.

    ### Applies To

    - TFS Integration Tools 2.2, March 2012

    ### Finding

    This was a Configuration error that was not really presented effectively. I found it by reducing the dataset to a few known failing items and commenting out all of the field before re-running the migration. I then added each field in one at a time until the error occurred.

    I had a missing field migration to map a data value into reason:

    And I had an incorrect mapping in the ValueMap:

    **Figure: Value mapping for Reason field**

    You can see on lines 2 and 3 of the code above I had incorrectly specified the mapping as having a left value for the field that I was mapping as a @@MISSINGFIELD@@.

    ### Workaround

    The mentioned field either needs removed from the mapping or added to the work item. In this case I will be removing it from the mapping as I don’t need that field on the Task WIT.

    **Did this solve your problem?**

    [![image](images/image16-2-2.png "image")](http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image16-2-2.png)I have talked often of the idea of a [Project of Projects in Team Foundation Server](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-of-projects-with-team-foundation-server-2010/) and with the new feature in Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server I though it would make sense to revisit. I will talk a little of the idea of the [Master or Hierarchical Backlogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2012/01/27/tfs-vnext-configuring-your-project-to-have-a-master-backlog-and-sub-teams.aspx) using the new Agile Planning tools and I always find an example help with understanding so I will be using a recent engagement as a base. But first lets dispel a few myths.
    { .post-img }

    - Team Project ≠ Team
    - Team Project ≠ Project
    - Team Project ≠ Product
    - Team Project = WTF?

    You might think that it has been unfortunately named, but the Visual Studio ALM tooling has been designed to have a low barrier to entry and as such the happy path is:

    - Team Project = Team
    - Team Project = Project

    Have I confused you yet?

    Well, for the single, or small group of developers the common and easy path is to create a new Team Project for each project and they will only ever have one team. So this is the way that it is out-of-the-box and it serves its purpose.

    ### One Team Project to rule them all

    The rest of us live in a more complicated world of multiple teams, multiple projects and multiple priorities. To achieve this we need to think about the following things in Team Foundation Server:

    - Teams (can be mapped to Area or to a Work Item Field Definition)
    - Areas (Tree)
    - Iteration (Tree)
    - Source Code  (has folders)
    - Work Item Queries (has folders)
    - Build

    No matter what our configuration and requirements we can use a single Team Project. There are however a number of circumstances where you will not be able to do this:

    - **A large consultancy**If you are in a large consultancy with 1000+ customers then it makes more sense to use a  one Team Project per customer model so as to avoid confusion and scaling issues. Don’t think just because you are a consultancy that you need to use this model. Think carefully about your choice…
    - **An organisation with 100’s of Teams**If you are a single organisation that has 100’s of teams than you might also run into limitation of scale. I would in this case recommend that you have one Team Project per Department or Division depending on their scale and organisation.

    In these cases there are two limitation that need to be considered carefully. You can only have 254 areas per level and there is a soft limit of about 300 Team Projects per Team Project Collection.

    If neither of these apply (or you are at the Customer, Department or Division level within an organisation within which it does) then you can achieve a single Team Project.

    ### One Team Project to find them

    So, what has changed? Well with the advent of the idea and the technical implementation of Team in Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service we can take advantage of the new constructs and reduce our complexity while simultaneously increase our features.

    I do however have a reality check for those of you that want to use the new tools but work within a traditionally run organisation.

    [![More than 34% of companies are now doing agile](images/image17-3-3.png "More than 34% of companies are now doing agile")](http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image17-3-3.png) **Figure: More than 34% of companies are now doing agile**
    { .post-img }

    They are called the “Agile Planning” tools for a reason. They are exclusively targeted at the ~34% of the industry that are working in an Agile manor and that are 3 times more  likely to succeed than a traditionally run project. They are also aimed at the 30% that don’t really know what the want as an easy adoption path.

    [![Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful](images/image18-4-4.png "Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful")](http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image18-4-4.png) **Figure: Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful**
    { .post-img }

    Does this mean that those of you can’t use the Agile Planning tools? Hell no! It just means that you are not in the happy path so make the most of them that you can.

    ### One Team Project to bring them all

    In a recent engagement my customer needed some rather specific things to be possible but also wanted to take advantage of the new Agile Planning features. They wanted to pull together all of the Teams and individuals from the Business all the way through the Development Teams to Infrastructure. To achieve that we identified a few must haves:

    - Must be able to see an ordered backlog per team
    - Must be able to see an ordered backlog per department/customer
    - Must be able to see what product and product area each work item is assigned to

    In order to achieve this all I need to customise is to add a single new field to the Product Backlog Item. Is we add a “\[mycustomer\].Customer” field to the PBI and make it a drop-down-list of all of the existing customers

    [![image](images/image19-5-5.png "image")](http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image19-5-5.png) **Figure: Adding a field to store the external customer**
    { .post-img }

    I can then create a query for each of the customers to show the backlog and allow anyone with permission to view that backlog.

    { .post-img }

    If I can query it I can then export to excel and reorder it just like we did when connecting to TFS 2010.

    { .post-img }

    So with a single added field we have enabled not only querying and ordering of data associated with a customer, but we also made the field reportable as a dimension in the data warehouse and cube.

    Awesome and easy…

    Now all we need to add is [two teams in the new Agile Planning tools in addition](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2012/01/27/tfs-vnext-configuring-your-project-to-have-a-master-backlog-and-sub-teams.aspx) to the default and configure them to only show their own backlog based on the Area Path (or we can configure it to use a Team drop-down).

    The point is that we can support most, if not all configurations as long as you are willing to change the way that you work a little. Hopefully not much, but there is always change in adopting a new tool. Although we don’t want our tools to prescribe our workflow, we may actually want to change the way that we work to take advantage of cool things that we just had no access to before.

    ### And in the Process Template bind them

    [![220px-Gollum](images/220px-Gollum-1-1.png "220px-Gollum")](http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/220px-Gollum-1-1.png)The key to a successful Team Foundation Server deployment is in the Process Template that is chosen to be the base moving forward. I always start with the Visual Studio Scrum template as a base as it has the most compatible workflow and terminology to the way we tend to speak and discuss about work.
    { .post-img }

    Remember that whatever process template that you pick it is but a starting point for building your own process on top of. Don’t be afraid to customise, just don’t go nuts… no one likes a frankin-template…

    ### Conclusion

    Not only is larger Team Projects the recommendation of [almost all of the experts in the field](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/when-should-i-use-areas-in-tfs-instead-of-team-projects-in-team-foundation-server-2010/), it is also the recommendation and expectation of the product team for mature teams and organisations using Team Foundation Server.

    Following on from last weeks successful [Upgrading TFS 2010 to TFS 2012 with VSS Migration and Process Template consolidation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-with-vss-migration-and-process-template-consolidation/) I finished off the last of the 20-30 Team Project Process Template migration/upgrades to a customised form on the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0. We only added a couple of fields, but we also defined a process and strategy for use of the Template within the organisation.

    If you are looking for why you might want one team project:

    **Figure: Consolidate to a single Team Project Collection**

    As pert of the process of getting everything onto a single Process Template, namely the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0, we identified that the customer should also move to a single Team Project Collection and more than that, into a single Team Project.

    Why you might ask?

    As [I have often mentioned before](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/project-of-projects-with-team-foundation-server-2010/) there are a number of reasons that you would want to be on a single Team Project Collection and there are also reasons why you do not. You should have separate Team Project Collections when:

    - There is not nor will there ever be a relationship between source or work items between Collections
    - You want to  move source from one location to another
    - You have more than 300 Team Projects

    In this case the things that we do want to do are:

    - Link Work Items from one project to another
    - Move work items from one project to another

    There is only one tool for this job and that is the [TFS Integration Platform](http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/). While the TFS Integration Platform provides lost of migration options I am interested only in the TFS 2012 –> TFS 2012 variety which greatly simplifies the configuration. In addition to that I am migrating from a Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 Process Template to… well… a Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 Template. I just have 20-30 Team Projects to migrate. The key here is to get the mappings correct.

    ### Installing TFS Integration Platform with Visual Studio Team Explorer 2012

    As soon as I downloaded the TFS Integration platform I ran into a bug where the registry key is not found and the Wix installer does not look for the right Key for the RC. The key it is looking for is only present if a developer edition of Visual Studio is installed.

    [![screenie99](images/screenie99_thumb-11-11.jpg "screenie99")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/screenie99.jpg)

    **Figure:** [**TFS Integration Tools – Issue: “This tool requires the TFS client object model”**](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2012/07/04/tfs-integration-tools-issue-this-tool-requires-the-tfs-client-object-model.aspx)

    Luckily [Jahangeer Mohammed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2011/04/19/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-jahangeer-mohammed.aspx) road to the rescue within 4 hours of me reporting the issue with the root cause and Willy posted the solution the very next day. That's ALM Ranger efficiency… customer was very impressed (although [Neno](http://blog.nenoloje.com/) would have a fit over the offending registry key)

    ### Running the TFS Integration Platform for the first time on TFS 2012

    The first time you run the TFS Integration Platform on any computer you will get a message asking you to add the account that it is running under to a particular group. You can either add it manually or click “Yes” to get it to do it itself…quickly followed by cursing as you need to be in Administrator mode. Restart… Yes… all is good with the world.

    I will get into the configuration in just a minute, but first lets solve the very first error message you will run into.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TFS WIT bypass-rule submission is enabled**

    You may not be using an account that is in the “Team Foundation Server Service Accounts” group or the equivalent Collection group. No wait… you can’t just go an add it. This is a special group that does not allow you to populate it through the UI. You can however view it and all of the accounts that you use for your Build Agents, Build Controllers and other bits and bobs will all be in this list already. So how to add your TFS Integration Platform account?

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Updating the TFS Security group**

    You use our old friend the command line. There is an application called TfsSecurity that will allow you to add an account directly to that group.

    ```
    tfssecurity /g+ "Team Foundation Service Accounts" n:domainusername ALLOW /server:http://myserver:8080/tfs

    ```

    Now you have that sorted you are ready to rock…

    ### Migrating Source Control using the TFS Integration Platform

    As we are trying to fold 30 Team Projects across 4 Team Project Collections into a single Team Project on a single Team Project Collection we need to be very specific with the mappings. We are also really lucky that there are no relationships between Work items and Version Control which simplifies the process as we can do them separately.

    There are a ridicules number of options here and the [rangers have many, many documented](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2011/06/06/toc-tfs-integration-tools-blog-posts-and-reference-sites.aspx) options that will allow you to do whatever you want. There is however something interesting that you can do and that we wanted to try... You can move individual branches to new locations while maintaining the relationships. This works really well on codebases that do not have a lot of complex branches or deletes. If you have many deletes outside of the scope, or you have a lot of sub branches of code branches into your solution from outside of the scope of a team project you can run into a few problems.

    [![image](images/image_thumb3-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image3.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Complicated mappings will not always work**

    You can skip to the end to see all of the problems and solutions, but if you are doing these complicated mappings you may have issues getting a distinct mapping due to how the TFS Integration Platform creates mappings, but the solution is to ditch the mappings and the root of $/TeamProjectA/ to the single sub folder of  $TeamProjectB/TeamProjectA/ so that everything is just mapped at that level. This solved all of those problems and you can always do the rearranging later.

    Regardless of this problem we needed to map all of our existing Team Projects to a new folder underneath a single existing Team Project on our new Collection. We are mapping each Team Project individually as that is how the TFS Integration Platform is setup so we need to create a Migration Configuration for each Team Project.

    We actually tried the complex rearrange mapping on all of the projects and called a “destroy” on the migrated source for all of the ones that failed and redid them at the root.

    ```
    tf destroy $/somefolder/somesubfolder/ /collection:http://mytfsserver:8080/tfs/tfs01

    ```

    **Figure: Destroying Migrated data to start again**

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: A successful mapping**

    Make sure that you check the source after you bring it across for consistency as even if the Platform tells you all is well, it could well be lying and we did find a couple of glitches (again detailed below).

    Effectively you just go through each of your source Team Projects, mapping them to the destination Team Project and keep going until you are done. The time it will take will depend on the amount of source code and the number of changes, but the source code will be fairly fast.

    There is a neat trick that works pretty well if you don’t have any differences, except for the target folder, for your source to bring everything across from a Collection.

    [![image](images/image_thumb5-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image5.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Just because your pick a Team Project does not mean that is the root**

    In this case I want to bring everything across from all of the Team Projects in the Collection to a folder under the new Team Project. Now, you need to initially select a Team Project as the source but I then changed it to “$/” to just bring everything across to its new home of “$/NewTeamProejct/Department/” and have it create folders of the same name as the old Team Projects as plain folders.

    [![image](images/image_thumb6-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/07/image6.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Runs through like a dream**

    I had initially worried that it work choke at the Team Project boundary, but I have checked that everything is coming across properly and for a change it is operating exactly as you would expect given the settings.

    So, apart from the 7 team projects that I have a block on to see if a fix comes through from the Product Team I have successfully consolidated the Source from

    ### Migrating Work Items using the TFS Integration Platform

    ![simples](images/simples-12-12.png "simples")Because we have already completed the [Process Template consolidation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-with-vss-migration-and-process-template-consolidation/) we only have one Process Template mapping to work about… or do we. If you used [method #7](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-7-overwrite-retaining-history-with-limited-migration/) for migrating  your process template you will be left with extra fields that are not part of the core template. Make sure that the destination Team Project has the same work item type definitions as the source Team Project and you will have no problems ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-13-13.png)
    { .post-img }

    In your configuration file, because we have the same work item types on each end, you can just map all of the Left Work Item Types to all of the Right Work Item Types…

    **Figure: Work Item Mappings**

    On top of that they only real issue is that you need to enable [WIT Bypass rules submission](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2009/11/10/tfs-integration-platform-what-is-the-enablebypassruledatasubmission-in-the-configuration-file-question-answer-7.aspx) which tells the TFS Integration Platform to use the Woeb Services directly and not the API’s. Why, you might ask…. well we need to be able to write historical states that do not actually exist in the workflow so that we can maintain the history.

    **Figure: Enabling the WIT Bypass rules submission**

    Enabling this will allow us to seamlessly do the migration of Work Item data. If we did have links between Source Control and Work Items we can handle that by either migrating both Source and Work Items in the same session or we can add the relationships later.

    A final configuration would include some mapping or transformation of the Area Path so that we can find our merged work items later. The TFS Integration Platform will create any Area Paths that don’t already exist.

    ```
    < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>


















































































    ```

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Save your configuration ready to rumble**

    Once you have migrated your work items you will see some invalid data, but this is due to the Process Template consolidation that we have already completed. All you have to do is fix the visible data before you save and all is well…

    **Figure: Some work items will be invalid**

    And that finishes of migrating your data…

    ### Troubleshooting

    There are a couple of errors and exceptions that while outside the norm were a common occurrence for our migration:

    - [TFS Integration Tools – Issue: “unable to find a unique local path”](http://blog.nwcadence.com/tfs-integration-tools-issue-unable-to-find-a-unique-local-path/)
    - [TFS Integration Tools - Issue: Access denied to Program Files](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-integration-platform-issue-access-denied-to-program-files/)

    There were a number of references that I used as part of this engagement.

    ### Conclusion

    While it is difficult to migrate data or move data around in Team Foundation Server it is not insurmountable and mist issues can be solved if you can accept the trade-offs.

    - Are you interested in consolidating to fewer Team Projects?
    - Did you mistakenly create multiple Team Project Collections?

    If so then give us a call and we can help you fix it…

    - TFS Integration Tools 2.2, March 2012

    ### Finding

    If you check the logs you will see the same message as the popup:

    ```
    Application Error: 0 : [7/12/2012 2:41:32 PM] Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Migration.Toolkit.InitializationException: AnalysisProvider 06a2457f-ebba-4979-bc5f-0f5006b8b4e6 not found

    ```

    **Figure: Exception in Log**

    No new information there, but it does imply that there is a problem with the DLL, or that it is not there. I confirmed that it existed in the /Plugins/ folder but on starting a Debug session we see that the problem lies in the complication for .NET 3.5. .NET 3.5 relies on the .NET Framework 2.0 and the new TFS DLL’s all rely on .NET Framework 4.0.

    ### Workaround

    This problem is easily solved by changing the application settings from .NET Framework .NET 3.5 to .NET Framework 4.0 and recompiling.

    As part of the Migration process the TFS Integration Platform does a whole bunch of checks to make sure that what is being written in indeed what we want to write and what the destination is excepting. as a result, on occasion you will get a “Error occurred during the code review of change group”.

    **Figure: Error occurred during the code review of change group**

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools, version 2.2, March 2012

    ### Finding

    Before the TFS Integration Platform does a checkin it will run a bunch of checks to make sure that everything is on track. If any of those “code review” checks fail then you will receive this error. Even if you are running locally, web services, while robust run inside of IIS and can occasionally drop requests. Stuff happens, and this is not that unusual and in this case can cause a request not to be processed correctly.

    ### Workaround

    Using the “Auto Resolve” will usually fix the problem as it is likely caused b y a glitch in the web. Luckily TFS is an Atomic check-in system and you will not damage your server. Just running the request again will usually result in success.

    Once on the rerun I did get another conflict stating that the data being pushed across was already done which is likely the same cause as the first message just on the response and not the request. ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-3-3.png)

    You get a Unauthorised Access Exception when the TFS Integration Platform tries to write a file to the ‘C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration Tools2768.txt’ folder.

    **Figure: Access denied to Program Files?**

    This is a runtime error that must be resolved to continue.

    ### Applies to

    - TFS Integration Tools, version 2.2, March 2012

    ### Finding

    We are calling web services and as with all things web, things go awry occasionally. In this case we may not have gotten an timely response from the server. This does not mean that things have gone wrong, but instead that we may need to retry an action. Rather then choke the TFS Integration Platform does a “Code Review” and needs to write to its own local folder in order to save the log file required.

    [![7-6-2012 12-52-15 PM](images/7-6-2012-12-52-15-PM_thumb.png "7-6-2012 12-52-15 PM")](http://vsalm.blob.core.windows.net/blog-store/files/2012/07/7-6-2012-12-52-15-PM.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Code Review conflict**

    Just in case the Integration Platform throws a “Conflict” that needs to be resolved manually to continue. One of the options is to “Retry” and 100% of the times that we got this error that worked a treat.

    ### Workaround

    Right click on the “Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration Tools” and add permission for the account that you are running the TFS Integration Tools under.

    Back in Seattle and another awesome engagement, this time with a local company to upgrade their version of TFS from 2010 to 2012 and migrate all of their legacy VSS databases. Additional they want to take advantage of the new team features of TFS 2012 and need to consolidate all of their team projects

    I have been looking forward to this engagement for a while and we have a lot to do and get through. I try to create documentation for each customer and for the Team Foundation Server 2012 timeframe I have been trying to feedback as many experiences as possible to Microsoft. To that end these posts are more documentation of experiences rather than full How-To’s and I always try to link to the documentation on MSDN or other blog posts that I used to figure things out. This post is a work in progress, so I will be posting updates as we work through the remaining items for migration…

    Warning There should be code example as part of this post with XML configuration. Unfortunately something keeps eating them. No idea what...

    This post is part of a series of posts that document a Upgrade of TFS 2010 to TFS 2012 with a VSS Migration, Process Template consolidation, Team Project consolidation and a FogBugz migration:

    - Updated 2012-06-30 - [Phil Hodgson](https://twitter.com/PGHodgson) one of the developers for TFS has been able to repo my typeNames  issue and resolved it by clearing the browser cache. While that was one of the first things that I tried onsite, I will need to give it a further look. This will most likely be the solution and I just did not do it right on the day ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile3-24-24.png) Kudos to Phil…

    - Updated 2012-07-05 - [Phil Hodgson](https://twitter.com/PGHodgson) hit it right on the nose and this let us complete the Process Template Consolidation this morning.

    #### Summary

    What we are essentially trying to do is consolidate all of the Version Control, Work item Tracking and any other data used by the development team into a single supportable solution.

    [![Physical structure of environment](images/image_thumb48-1-1.png "Physical structure of environment")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image66.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Physical structure of environment**

    We have 3 separate systems that we want to merge and luckily there are out-of-the-box tools for two of them but we will have to see what the story is with Fogbugz.

    [![Logical grouping of Systems](images/image_thumb49-2-2.png "Logical grouping of Systems")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image67.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Logical grouping of Systems**

    We have a whole bunch of steps that need to be preformed in a certain order to be successful. With the VS 2012 RC the only supported way to move source from VSS to TFS is to do a tip migration only. If you want the full history you are going to have to migrate your VSS data into TFS 2010 and then upgrade. This is not a big deal, but it does delay the production TFS upgrade a little.

    1. **DONE - Day 1- Trial Upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC in Test Environment**  
       This was completed as a “disaster recovery” migration and tool little more than 20 minutes.
    2. **DONE - Day 1 - Plan for upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC**  
       We have a plan detailed below to achieve this tomorrow.
    3. **DONE - Day 1 - Plan for upgrade of VSS 2005 to TFS 2010 SP1 with Configuration files**   
       We have successfully created the mapping files and a plan to migrate this tomorrow morning.
    4. **DONE - Day 1 - Trial upgrade of VSS 2005 to TFS 2010 SP1  
       **We have successfully migrated your largest VSS database to a trial collection in TFS 2010..
    5. **DONE - Day 1 - Verify migration from XP to TFS 2010 using the MSSCCI Provider**
    6. **DONE – Day 2 - Production upgrade of VSS to TFS 2010**
    7. **DONE – Day 2 - Production upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC**
    8. **DONE – Day 3 - Customisation of Process Template**
    9. **DONE – Day 3 - Upgrade of existing Team Projects to Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 Process Template**

    This is just the summary the implementation is way more fun…

    #### Implementation

    I always like to test everything first so I do trials of everything before I start doing the real thing. So I tend to have all of the errors, exceptions and wackier things as part of the and it should then just be a case of following the steps and dealing with the know errors and issues.

    1.  **DONE - Trial Upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC in Test Environment**
        As per [Installing TFS 2012 with Lab Management](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-with-lab-management-2012/) the install was easy and flawless. We did have to reboot to install .NET 4.5, but that is common. We did a full configuration of TFS 2012 in its native state to verify that we could get everything working in the environment before trying an upgrade.

            \[ARG… The Problem Steps recorder does not record Admin apps unless running in admin!\]

            > Warn when you hit the default number of screen shots so that I know that I have to save and start recording again. Better yet, do that automatically as I hit the limit. because of this I am having to mock my documentation.
            > **\-Suggestion for Problem Steps Recorder Team**

            As part of any upgrade I like to do a trial upgrade on the new hardware before I do anything else. There are many reasons for this but the two that spring to mind are problems, and timing. We need to take the current TFS environment offline in order to do an upgrade and that can take time… but how much? Well, that depends on two things, the problems and the time it takes to execute the upgrade. Due to the PSR issue I have created a suggestion for above I have had to create screenshots by doing an Upgrade locally but all of the other screenshots are from the customers own environment. I did however follow exactly the same steps…

        **Figure: Un-configuring TFS is easy with tfsconfig setup /uninstall:all**
        Just in case you need it, TFS 2012 has an Uninstall option that really just un-configures it. This is a fantastic feature that helps after a trial upgrade to reset things so that you can follow the same steps.

        **Figure: Backing up TFS 2010**
        Some folks script this out… I am old school and clicked away for the 5 db’s that I needed. Once you have everything backed up, head on over to new TFS 2012 server and restore all of the 2010 DB’s there. SQL Server 2012 will automatically upgrade them to its new format. Remember to take across the tfs_Warehouse as well as this will be upgraded as well.

        **Figure: Upgrading and moving server at the same time… the Upgrade Wizard is your friend**
        Even though we are moving server, same as [my previous TFS 2010 to TFS 2012 upgrade](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/presenting-visual-studio-alm-upgrading-tfs-2010-to-tfs-2012-in-production-done/), I did not require to do a TFS 2010 move first as I did before. I think that this was a simpler install as it was single server with the DB local and I was not changing configuration, just hardware. I did everything in one go.

        **Figure: New database restore**
        You can use the new database restore if you are currently using the [TFS 2010 Power Tools backup](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/creating-a-backup-in-team-foundation-server-2010-using-the-power-tools/) facility to backup you server, but as I did a manual backup I need to do a manual restore. However this new feature makes it far easier and faster to get up and running in a disaster recovery scenario…

        **Figure: Even better than TFS 2010**
        I don’t know how the product team managed it after the awesomeness that was a TFS 2010 upgrade, but they have made it even slicker. The feel of the install is one of spit and polish applied in abundance. All other product installs pale in comparison when you consider what it is doing…

        **Figure: Set your TFS Service Account**
        As we are working in a single server environment we need not use a Domain Account. I usually do anyway, but there is more setup on the domain front and although I had a tame domain admin available, it is not worth the extra hassle unless you are branching out to multi server. It is easy to change later, so I took the easy path…

        **Figure: Connecting to Reporting Services**
        There are a lot of cool features that Reporting Services and Analysis services offers so it is worth configuring it, and this should be painless as long as you have permission and access to both RS and AS. If they are managed / shared services you will be in for a world of hurt if the respective owners are not cooperative. That hurt not being the TFS teams fault is no consolation to that mess. This being a Single-Server deployment, we have a much easier time..

        **Figure: Verification Step**
        As well as validation at each and every stage of the wizard the product team have done an extensive verification system that checks everything it can to make sure that the actual configuration goes smoothly.

        **Figure: The green tick of Success**
        The full process for upgrading from beginning the backup process to having TFS 2012 up and running too less than 1 hour… yes that's 60 minutes. We only had around 3GB of data in 4 collections so that is not unusual and your times may vary. That is why I always insist on a trial upgrade first.

    2.  **DONE - Plan for upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC**
        The trial upgrade took around 10 minutes to backup and copy all of the data across to the new server and then only 20 minutes to do the actual Upgrade to TFS 2012. This means that at most the upgrade will take 1 hour and then the developers can get access to start coding away again.

            We will plan for 2 hours worth of down time to complete:

            1. Reset environment to an un-configured state

                ```
                tfsconfig setup /uninstall:ALL
                ```

                **Figure: Uninstalling is really un-configuring**

                I have found the uninstall feature particularly useful in the upgrade scenarios where I want to run through a trial upgrade first and then do a production one. This way I can run both the same way and from the same starting state.

                [![image](images/image_thumb60-13-13.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image78.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You can un-configure your TFS environment easily** 2. Delete all configuration and collection databases from TFS including tfs_warehouse 3. Email all TFS user to get off the system 4. Stop all user access to TFS 2010 (wait 10 minutes for the usual last minute check-in screams)
        Quesee the TFS 2010 server 5. Backup all TFS 2010 databases 6. Copy to TFS 2012 server and restore to SQL 2012 7. Run “Upgrade Wizard” for TFS 2012 8. Done

            Note: Based off [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404883(v=vs.100).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404883(v=vs.100).aspx)

    3.  **DONE - Plan for migrations of VSS 2005 to TFS 2010 SP1 with Configuration files**
        As with all migrations of data from one system to another this can be fraught with dangers. For a VSS to TFS migration you first need to find the documentation, which is no easy matter when all you get are 2005 and 2008 documentation and you are using 2010. Which if you look hard enough you can find as the [Migrate from Visual SourceSafe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms253060.aspx) document that comes in many flavours.

            If however you google bing “VSS to TFS 2010” none of the top items will get you to 2010 documentation, although it will very much look like it.

        You need to spell out what you need a little more specifically. This just a case of the right keywords for the task not resulting in the correct document.

        **Figure: ![metro-icon-tick](images/metro-icon-tick-20-20.png "metro-icon-tick")The Correct VSS to TFS migration documentation**
        { .post-img } > Make sure that your documentation cross references, or redirects to the right thing. In the TFS Teams defence the content on MSDN is both extensive and detailed. I don’t know how they keep it all strait. > \-Suggestion to TFS Team

            Once you have this figured out you have a few things to do. First things first, make sure that your VSS databases are valid and have very little inconsistencies. In this case my customer takes great pains (as any VSS user should) to check their VSS databases often. There were only a few errors and hopefully they will not impact the migration itself.

            In order to bring the VSS data across you need a couple of configuration files and a command line. Some of the bits are however done for you and are relatively easy. If you follow the documentation described above it will lead you through all of the big steps.

            The main thing is to make sure that you create the correct settings file and then modify it for the final run with the TFS server and mapping information.

            ```
            < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
















            ```

            **Figure: The convertor takes lost of parameters, not all are needed for both Analysis and Migration**

            The first time you run this it should be in “analysis” mode before you run it in “migrate”. To do that just run:

            ```
            vssconverter Analyse settings.xml
            ```

            **Figure: Analyse and generate the User Settings file**

            The usermap file has a list of all of the Users in VSS and how the should be mapped to Active Directory.

            ```
            < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>






              ...


            ```

            **Figure: The usermap.xml file is generated**

            You can map any user that does not exist to a single account. That includes deceived and deleted Active Directory users.

        **Figure: Detailed Analysis Report**
        You may get a few errors here that you can do something bout, but I found that the TF227010 could be gotten rid of by following the instructions and installing a patch, but that the TF227026 could be safely ignored unless you want to get everyone to check in.

            After the analysis you can run the migration for real and I would suggest that you do this to a test collection first so that you can verify and rerun to your hearts content until you get it write.

    4.  **DONE - Trial migration of VSS 2005 to TFS 2010 SP1**
        Actually running the migration was fairly simple and we only ran into one little hiccup. It should however be noted that this is a one-time forward-only migration of data and if it messes up you will need to delete / destroy the folders that you have migrated and run it again…

            [![image](images/image_thumb61-14-14.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image79.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You will always get the BuildProcessTemplates exists as… well… it does**
        Make sure that your references are correct and much of the settings.xml file is case sensitive. I don’t know why, and one of my pet hates is case sensitivity, but it is there so watch it…

            Make sure that you have all of the users added as contributors on your target TFS Collection or you will get errors. This can result in a “[TF60014 & TF60087: Failed to initialise user mapper](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/vss-converter-issue-tf60014-tf60087-failed-to-initialise-user-mapper/)” error which is easily resolved. In addition you need to watch out for a server clock issue that can have an affect. As you are hammering the server with check-ins your clock may be automatically reset by Active Directory. Now while this is not normally an issue you may get a  “[TF54000: Cannot update the data because the server clock may have been set incorrectly](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/vss-converter-issue-tf54000-cannot-update-the-data-because-the-server-clock-may-have-been-set-incorrectly/)” that you will need to resolve.

            The actual migration of this 1.2 GB set of data took around 40 minutes to complete once it got all the way through. This is the largest of the 4 VSS’s that we need to migrate and the smallest is 25mb…

    5.  **DONE - Verify migration from XP to TFS 2010 using the MSSCCI Provider**
        Just to make sure that we are still able to connect from the legacy system. As we are using XP, everything takes ages to install ![Winking smile](images/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile-26-26.png)
        { .post-img } 1. Install .NET 4.0 2. Install Team Explorer 2010 SP1

                Note: SP1 takes AGES on Windows XP!

            3. Install MSSCCI Provider ([Team Foundation Server MSSCCI Provider 2010](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bce06506-be38-47a1-9f29-d3937d3d88d6))
            4. Connect from “File | Source Control | Team Foundation Server MSSCCI Provider”

            While it was painful to use XP the customer does still have some code in Visual Studio 2003 which is not supported on Windows 7.

    6.  **DONE - Production upgrade of VSS to TFS 2010**

        Now that we have the Trial complete and the tests performed it is time to motor on with the production upgrade. The first task is to mark all of the users as read-only. This is likely to go just like the trial, except hopefully we will not have that annoying datetime issue. It is just a case of running thorough all three of the databases on after another and watching the scrolling status.

        1. **VssDb1**– 1.02 GB

           This DB contains mostly Visual Studio 2003 projects and resulted in 49880 actions that took about 65 minutes to commit to TFS 2010.

        2. **VssDb2**– 527mb

           This DB contains mostly Visual Studio 2008 projects and resulted in 30657 action that took about 37 minutes to commit to TFS 2010. It did have a bunch of errors, but they were due to known corruptions in the VSS database and will need to be managed manually if at all.

        3. **VssDb3**– 39.6mb

           This DB contains mostly Visual Studio 2010 projects and resulted in 5830 actions that took about 6 minutes to commit to TFS 2010.

        Its all bout the number of actions and not just the size of the data.

    7.  **DONE - Production upgrade of TFS 2010 SP1 to TFS 2012 RC**

        We have around 2 GB of data in TFS 2010 so the upgrade is a little trivial from a size perspective. This was a totally uneventful upgrade that just worked as we did it in the Trial.

    8.  **DONE - Customisation of Process Template**
        If you are going to be customising work item then you need to make sure that you have the Power Tools installed for your version of Visual Studio. This is what you will be using to do the customisation unless you can see xml like matrix code ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile4-25-25.png)

        **Figure: Adding customer fields is relatively easy**
        The key to adding fields is to not think about fields. What? But I want fields… well no… not quite.. You want reports. That’s a subtle difference but a difference none the less. Look at what reports that you want to have and loop back to fields from there. You will be surprised at home many fields you just don't need.

        **Figure: Always test against a development server**
        I just installed a new TFS 2012 server in a VM in order to test their process template. While the validation rules are good, they do not always catch everything and I like to make sure that I can create and walk through the work item before I push it to the production server!

            [![image](images/image_thumb67-17-17.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image85.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Everything should be under Version Control**
        Make sure that you check in your changes to the process template. I like to download the entire process template and put that under version control so that any changes going forward are captured. Even though I encourage most customers to have very few Team Projects it still makes sense to do this. The single point of truth should always be version control.

    9.  **DONE - Upgrade of existing Team Projects to Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 Process Template**
        For this I am going to create a hybrid of [Process Template Upgrade #7 – Rename Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-7-overwrite-retaining-history-with-limited-migration/) and [Process Template Upgrade #3 – Destroy all Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-3-destroy-all-work-items-and-import-new-ones/). The customer is only using a few Tasks and a handful of Test Cases that they needs to keep.

            I created a little batch file to upgrade from one of the MSF for Agile 4.x Templates to the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 without losing any data.

            Warning: Data will disappear wen we upload the new work item types, but it is still all there as orphan fields in the TFS database. You can follow the instructions in #7 to make the data visible gain. This script is provided with no warranties and guarantees. Make really sure by running it against a mock up or clone of your Team Project.

            ```

            Pause

            ```

            **Figure: Scripting out an process template migration**

            Once you have done the process template migration you should heavily test it to make sure that you are not loosing anything or killing your TFS server.

            I have about 40 Team Projects to migrate over 3 Team Project Collections. Once everyone is on a consistent process template we will then begin the process of consolidating all of those into a single Collection, but that is a story for another day.

            [![image](images/image_thumb68-18-18.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image86.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Team Home rename does not take (Invalid argument value: Parameter name: typeNames)**
        The only error I am getting after the migration is only for the Agile->Scrum migration as it required a rename of “User Story” to “Product Backlog Item” which seams to have confused the UI a little. I have tried an IIS Reset to no avail and so emailed the Product Team for advice. I will let you know how that turns out.

            Other than that everything else works. The Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 –> Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 migration went perfectly and they now have all of the native work items and no Sprint item. There are really two other areas to worry about, which I am not right at this moment, and that is Reports and Queries. One the UI hiccup is fixed we are going to be consolidating all of the Team Projects into a single Collection so spending a lot of time on Report is not going to be worth it.

            Check out the afore mentioned [Process Template Upgrade #7 – Rename Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-7-overwrite-retaining-history-with-limited-migration/) post for a full listing of everything you need to do to complete the process.

    10. **DONE – Outstanding typeNames error**  
        This is literally just a caching issue in IE as defined by [Phil Hodgson](https://twitter.com/PGHodgson)

    #### Conclusion

    That was this week….next week we will be looking at completing the Process Template upgrade, importing all of the FogBugz data and it looks like we will also be consolidating all of the Team Project Collections, Team Projects and Products into a single Team Project .

    One project to rule them all…

    When running a VSS to TFS import using the VSSConverter.exe you may recieve a “TFTF60014: The username domainusername in the user map file c:tempusermap.xml is invalid”.

    ### Applies to

    - VSSConverter.exe
    - Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server

    ### Finding

    When you are doing a mapping and you map a user that is valid as far as Active Directory is concerned, but has not been granted permission against the Team Project Collection to which you are doing the import you will receive this message.

    ### Workaround

    Adding the mapped users to the Contributors group on the target server will remove this error.

    > Add a further error, or change the wording to make it clear where the user does not exist. First check AD, then check that it can access TFS.

    ### Issue

    During a VSS import you get a TF54000 error with a message of “Cannot update the data because the server clock may have been set incorrectly”

    **Figure: TF54000: Cannot update the data because the server clock may have been set incorrectly**

    ### Applies to

    - VSSConverter.exe
    - Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server

    ### Finding

    What looks to have happened is that the scheduled time synchronisation just happened to occur during the migration and threw TFS a curve ball. Essentially you cant add data in the past when there is data in the future. I have blogged about [Full-fidelity history and data migration are mutually exclusive](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/full-fidelity-history-and-data-migration-are-mutually-exclusive/) and the tractability features in TFS that require this if you are interested. The root cause of this is likely to be the normal time sync from Active Directory being applied mid migration. While this is not normally going to cause a glitch, if you are making the number of calls that a migration does and the clock is set back only a few seconds you can encounter this.

    ### Workaround

    Just wait for a minute (or so) and resume (thanks Cheryl) the migration by re-running the command.

    I have been onsite this week in California to deploy TFS 2012 and Lab Management for a company in the computer game industry. Because of limited time I am doing the full install in one day and thus will not be getting any of their builds or environments to work today. This is purely an install and test of the happy paths. I have loads of time over the rest of the week running workshops for the customer to bring their guys up to speed on how to do everything else.

    - **UPDATED 2012-06-20** – [Adam Cogan](http://www.adamcogan.com/) sent me a bunch of corrections that I incorporated. He also suggested a diagram or summary. How about both!
    - **UPDATED 2012-06-21** – Finally got the Lab issues ironed out. Now that you can no longer edit the environment details (Lab Manager honours what your SysAdmins  say goes) you really need to make sure that they are right before you start ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile3-44-44.png)) I did get further in setting up an environment, but ran into an issue that I think should work…
      { .post-img }
    - **UPDATED 2012-06-22** – Updated with working recipe. Make sure that you enable “File and Print Sharing”.

    So, what's involved in this?

    ### Summary

    There are a lot of moving parts to a TFS deployment and when you add Lab Management you get a bunch more. It looks and sounds like a scary thing to deploy. But you just make a list and start at the beginning.

    [![TFS 2012 & Lab 2012 Diagram](images/image_thumb40-22-22.png "TFS 2012 & Lab 2012 Diagram")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image58.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I have a number of moving parts**

    1. DONE- Install SQL Server 2012 (40 minutes)
    2. DONE- Install & Configure Team Foundation Server 2012 (30 minutes)
    3. DONE- Install & Configure Team Foundation Build Controller 2012 (10 minutes)
    4. DONE- Install & Configure Team Foundation Build Agent 2012 (10 minutes)
    5. DONE- Install & Configure Team Foundation Test Controller 2012 (10 minutes)
    6. DONE- Install System Centre Virtual Machine Manager 2012 (20 minutes)
    7. DONE- Integrate TFS 2012 and SCVMM 2012 (5 minutes)
    8. DONE- Test Automated Build (20 minutes)
    9. DONE- Test Environmental Deploy

    ### Implementation

    Well I have a number of things that I need to do to achieve this. Lets start at the beginning and walk through all of the steps. I will be recording all of the thing that did not go well in the hopes that I can make your deployment easier.

    1.  DONE - **Install SQL Server 2012 (40 minutes)**

        Just make sure that you select "Full Text Search" and the "Client Tools". Then select Database Engine, Analysis Services and Reporting Services as required.

    2.  DONE – **Install & Configure Team Foundation Server 2012 (30 minutes)**
        As we are installing TFS in a Single-Server configuration we can use the Standard wizard and have it configure everything. The down side of this version of the wizard is that it will use the TfsService account for all of the uses including the reports account and the SharePoint account. For this install and due to the time limitations I am going to stick with this configuration and I will change it later if I need.

            [![Install & Configure Team Foundation Server 2012: Selecting your wizard](images/image_thumb11-1-1.png "Install & Configure Team Foundation Server 2012: Selecting your wizard")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image18.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Selecting your Wizard**
        This is by far the quickest way to install TFS and while I would get to configure every little detail using the “Advanced” wizard, it is of little benefit here.

            [![image](images/image_thumb12-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image19.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Installing SharePoint**
        SharePoint is a necessary evil for many companies and while I don’t see the benefit myself, many organisations really like it. Yes it can be a useful tool, but you know what they say:

            > You have a problem… you solve it with SharePoint… now you have two problems…

            [![image](images/image_thumb13-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image20.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Running the Readiness Checks**
        TFS 2010 went a long way to east the problems of installing and configuring a product with this many moving parts and integration points. TFS 2012 takes it one step further by adding the experience of 100’s of installs by 100’s of professionals that have fed back to the Product Team to make this experience as slick as possible.

            [![image](images/image_thumb14-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image21.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: All Good, now we can configure…**
        Just because all of the checks have completed successfully, this does not means that you will not get any errors or problems. It just means that you should not get any that folks have had before ![Smile with tongue out](images/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout-45-45.png)
        { .post-img }
        [![image](images/image_thumb15-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image22.png)
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: All good, TFS 2012 configured**
        All going well you should now have all of the green ticks of a successful configuration. When the Product Team proposed this separation of install and configuration for TFS 2010 it was greeted with optimism… it is now regarded with love by those that worked through the dark ages of TFS 2005 and TFS 2008…

            [![image](images/image_thumb16-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image23.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Now we can test a few things**
        Not only has TFS been configured properly but a bunch of other checks and changes have been performed for those regular gotchas. Like dynamic compression in IIS and opening ports on the firewall.

            [![image](images/image_thumb17-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image24.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: App Tier and Portal are working**
        A quick test of the App-Tier components shows that all is well and working. We did a few things to tidy up after this, for example we added a friendly URL of [http://tfs.domain.com](http://tfs.domain.com) for all of the services. This was not required, but it helps round things off so that users feel more love.

            In addition we created a new CompanyCollection and CompanySandbox team project to get folks started with messing around.

            NOTE: Do not think you are done with a TFS install until you have created a Team Project with all of the trimmings (SharePoint and Reporting Services) as well as checked the data.

    3.  DONE –**Install & Configure Team Foundation Build Controller 2012 (10 minutes)**
        This was an uneventful install. No errors on Server 2008 R2 and no additional requirements above all of the Windows Updates.

            [![image](images/image_thumb18-8-8.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image25.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Select “Configure Team Foundation Build Service” and start the wizard**
        Again all of the configuration happens separately from the install. This eases the burden if things go wrong and allows us to snapshot our virtual environments prior to configuration actions.

            [![image](images/image_thumb19-9-9.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image26.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Configuring a Build Controller is as easy as installing**
        After you have selected your Team Project Collection make sure that you configure with zero agents. This is going to be the Controller and should not have any Agents installed locally. I specifically made this server less powerful so a not to take up resources unnecessarily. If you are only going to have one Agent, or one server with Agents then you can put the controller on that box or even on the TFS server. However if you pan to have more Agents you should get the box sorted now…

    4.  DONE – **Install & Configure Team Foundation Build Agent 2012 (10 minutes)**
        This was an uneventful install. No errors on Server 2008 R2 and no additional requirements above all of the Windows Updates.

            ![image](images/image27-30-30.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Just like the Controller**
        ![image](images/image28-31-31.png "image")
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Easy configuration**
        It is pretty much identical to the Controller configuration except that we are adding two agents to the existing Controller. This is obvious from the options and easy to follow.

    5.  DONE – **Install & Configure Team Foundation Test Controller 2012 (10 minutes)**
        This was another uneventful install although it is different from the other installs. It has a stand alone installer and a different UI that is a throwback from its past as a lowly Load Test Controller. Now that it is part of TFS is does way more than simple Load Testing, but still has not been fully integrated with the look and feel of the other Agents. Never mind… there is always the next version. No errors on Server 2008 R2 and no additional requirements above all of the Windows Updates.

            ![image](images/image29-32-32.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Configuring the Test Controller**
        In order to configure the Test Controller for Load Testing you need to install some form of SQL Server. Express will do fine, but my customer has no need of Load Test for now. The purpose of this server is to gather results from the Lab Environments…

    6.  DONE - **Install System Centre Virtual Machine Manager 2012 (20 minutes)**
        I was installing SCVMM 2012 for the first time and they have moved all of my buttons, and not just in the install. Now technically you don’t need the SCVMM Console to be installed on the TFS Server any more with 2012, but I don’t have another box to control the Hosts. So my TFS Server is also my SCVMM Manager.

            ![image](images/image30-33-33.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Installing VMM Management Server**
        I am usually just installing the VMM Console, which is no longer required. But this is the VMM environment ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-43-43.png)

        **Figure: You require to install the Windows Automated Installation Toolkit**
        The TFS Product Team has spoiled us and we now expect all pre-requisites to be listed as one list and preferably installed automatically. Not so here and note that the Link to the page does not even work… arg… google bing… found… downloaded…

            Suggestion for SCVMM team: If you are going to provide a link, make sure that it works… better yet… put an install button and do it for me.

        **Figure: Needs permissions**
        Suggestion for SCVMM team: If you are doing checks don’t make the User restart the install and enter everything from scratch… have the courtesy that if I rerun the same action that I have probably taken some action and rerun the check….close install… restart … fill out everything again… woot…

        **Figure: Now add the Hosts**
        After you have installed and run the console you need to tell SCVMM where the hosts are that it should own.

            [![image](images/image_thumb21-11-11.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image39.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Make sure you have admin**
        You need to add the account that you are running the console under, “TfsLab” in this case, to the administrators group on the server. This will allow your console to configure everything it needs on the box.

            [![image](images/image_thumb22-12-12.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image40.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: SCVMM configures your host for you**
        As we don’t yet have a SAN attached (happening tonight) I created a Library Store on the local TFS Server to get moving. This will need moved tomorrow which will free up space… see later problem…

    7.  DONE - **Integrate TFS 2012 and SCVMM 2012 (5 minutes)**
        Its 11am and the thing that took the longest was installing SQL Server 2012. I now have all of my servers configured and installed, SharePoint has been integrated and now to plug TFS and SCVMM together to create the all powerful “Lab Manager”…

            [![image](images/image_thumb23-13-13.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image41.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You can now configure Lab Management**
        When you first hit this screen you will not have a “Configure” button, but once you have SCVMM installed you can click refresh (are you hearing this SCVMM Product Team) and I now see the “Configure” button.

            [![image](images/image94_thumb-41-41.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image94.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: TFS must be running under a domain account to configure Lab Management**
        Because I used the “Standard Single-Server” install TFS was configured to use NT AuthorityNetwork Service instead of a domain account. Well it takes about 30 seconds to change this from the Admin Console (Server | Application Tier | Change Account) and that fixes that pesky TF255484. Once in however you only need to enter the server name and click OK.

            [![image](images/image_thumb24-14-14.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image42.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Now you need to configure**
        Now that you have TFS and SCVMM configured into Lab Manager you get a lovely message letting you know that none of your Team Project Collections are configured yet… so lets take care of that…

            [![image](images/image_thumb25-15-15.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image43.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Configure Lab Management**
        Now that we have communication we need to tell the Collection that it can use Lab Management. If you go to “Server | Application Tier | Team Project Collections | DefaultCollection” you will see a “Lab Management” tab that has popped into existence. All you need is to configure a Library Share and Host Groups and you are done.

            Note: If like us you created a temporary Library Share until your main data store becomes available you will have to reconfigure this. But as it takes all of 2 minutes it is no biggie.

    8.  DONE - **Test Automated Build (20 minutes)**
        We are now technically DONE, but I like to give the environment a little exercise before it meets my [definition of Done](http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx).

        **Figure: Create and run a build**
        I walk though creating a build, first with an empty solution and then with a new Test Project and a single Unit Test. This proves out a bunch of things and allows you to pick up the missing Drop Folder and Symbols folder while we still have admin support to create them for us.

    9.  DONE - **Test Environmental Deploy**
        I ran into a couple of problems creating a test environment that are to do with SCVMM 2012, and the temporary Library Share.

            [![image](images/image_thumb27-17-17.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image45.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Can’t change guest settings**
        I always wondered why I had to change the settings in TFS 2010 and why they were not fixed to what the administrator set, now with them being read only in Lab Manager I missed that capability. I as an administrator can easily switch back to SCVMM to configure things, but it means that you need a little more close Infrastructure (or DevOps) support during initial setup. I am not complaining, just a consideration. I like that the engineers and testers can’t give boxes unlimited RAM. It’s a matter of capacity…

            [![image](images/image_thumb28-18-18.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image46.png)

        **Figure: Rather cryptic 22022 error from deployment**
        The error “22022: the customizable template must contain exactly one virtual disk marked as ‘contains an operating system’” is very cryptic. For some reason SCVMM 2012 did not set the HDD to be bootable, and even though there was only one HDD it could not figure it out? Anyway…

        **Figure: Fix for 22022 error “contains the operating system”**
        Easy fix that I found just by clicking around with minimal education in SCVMM. So not really a big deal, but the very reason I like to have a dry run…

        **Figure: No more space**
        Although this says that there is no space on the C: drive of the TFS box there is actually plenty, but the Host has been maxed out. This was fairly easy to fix with the help of the SysAdmins here.

        **Figure: Required Sysprep parameter LocalAdminCredentials what?**
        If you get an error 610, Virtual Machine Manager was unable to find a value for the required Sysprep parameter LocalAdminCredentials, then you likely need to get your SysAdmin to add Admin credentials to the box and make sure that they are entered as part of the configuration settings. To prove this out get them to instantiate the template and see it fail ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile3-44-44.png)

    DONE.

    I have emailed the product team as I followed the steps, but there may have been something missed and indeed there was. I had neglected to enable File and Print Sharing which is required by Lab/p>

    How have you been getting on with your 2012 Lab setups?

    I was actually a little surprised by one of my customers this week. I was there to help them finalise their deployment of TFS 2010 (that they were currently using only for Source Control) and to present the features to them and ended up upgrading them to TFS 2012 as well!

    The first thing that they wanted was a management level presentation of the capabilities of TFS and how everything goes together. I have both a 2010 and a 2012 soup-to-nuts presentation so I though I would hybridise. With the Visual Studio 2012 Release Candidate being so recently launched and combining that with the knowledge that Windows 8 needs to be in stores for Christmas and the full production “Go-Live” licencing provided by Microsoft it is a no-brainer to use Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server now rather than wait for RTM. In fact, if you are currently just using TFS for source control, or are in the process of deploying TFS 2010 now, I would wholeheartedly recommend jumping in with 2012. If you are using more features you will need to do a little more planning, but you should still consider it…

    This particular company is a major utility company and I had little hope of convincing them to move directly to 2012, but as I am so convicted that TFS 2012 is the way forward, it would be remiss of me if I did not try. I presented on Monday, and I upgraded them to TFS 2012 on Wednesday. Amazingly they immediately wanted to upgrade… no planning… just do it! Not my usual method…. but…

    From the products perspective this was a very strait-forward upgrade. From their environment, which I had no knowledge of to start with, it was a little more complicated. They were running SQL Server 2008 and would have needed to upgrade to 2008 R2 as a minimum, but the DB was on a central all in one cluster so that was going to be a big deal.

    So the we moved the DB’s to a new SQL 2012 on the TFS Server. With a very long lead time for upgrades (they just moved to 2008) and a longer lead time for servers, this was the most realistic way forward.

    We did run into a problem on our first go around on Tuesday that the server was not service packed and we had to wait for their server management company to apply it. Other than that there was only the normal issues that you get with a TFS environment that has been locked down after the last deployment… you know… no SysAdmin on SQL, locked down Analysis Services, remote SharePoint owned by another team…

    ### So what does it take to convince your organisation to move to Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server?

    So I had a full half day to present to their senior management so I talked about:

    1.  **Vision – what are you buying into with Visual Studio ALM**
        We looked at what TFS gives you out-of-the-box as well as some of the more recent additions. They had a minimum of Premium for all of their engineers so they already had a foundation of features to start with.

            ![image](images/image11-1-1.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Visual Studio ALM**
        Even just his list of things can be a little overwhelming, so I stayed away from the three new Russian doll models and concentrated on the breadth of capabilities from a high level. At this point I assess my audience and decide wither I need to bang the Agile drum…

    2.  **Agile – we can do better**
        Although the war had been won and it is now accepted as fact that Agile is a better way to build software than more traditional approaches there are still some hold outs. I talk about how “Agile” is now so widely used that it is now just “agile” and like “Waterfall” before it has become so diverse as to be more difficult than ever to pin down.

            ![image](images/image12-2-2.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: More folks are doing agile than ever before**
        I am sure that in another 50 years we will still hear stories of the loan company sticking its head out of the sand and saying “What do you mean the war is over?”

            ![image](images/image13-3-3.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: The CHAOS Manifesto**
        You are just more likely to succeed with agile… so lets accept things and move forward on that premise.

    3.  **Tractability in Team Foundation Server**
        This is key to most companies and is true of both 2010 and 2012. The crux of the argument is that everything in Visual Studio ALM is interconnected and that gives us the ability to trace from every line of code written through the Tasks to the PBI (Requirement, User Story, Bug) that elicited tat change.

            ![image](images/image14-4-4.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Visual Studio 2010 Tractability**
        Better than that we can then relate our requirements to builds, and the icing on the cake is full test case tractability back to the builds. Awesome…

            ![image](images/image15-5-5.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Visual Studio 2012 Tractability**
        Then we can hit the 2012 features and add tractability for Customer Feedback to PBI’s and for full integrated code reviews of every check-in.

            This one premise in the main killer feature for any company that has auditors…

    4.  **Process Improvement**
        At this point I really need to introduce the reality that TFS is just a Tool…and a tool does not solve your problems. It may help, but it can only improve your process as part of a concerted effort to…well… improve you processes.

            ![image](images/image16-6-6.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: TFS can be use to improve you process**

    5.  **Continuous Value Delivery**
        I then finish up with lots of demos on the various areas TFS and Visual Studio depending on the audience. In this case it was mostly managers and execs so I stayed in Storyboarding, Work Item Tracking and Feedback.

            ![image](images/image17-7-7.png "image")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Delivering Value is the key**

    So if you are presenting TFS to your management there is a lot for them to like. So much so, that if done right you should have no trouble convicting them that TFS will provide them with value. You do however need to remember that if your processes suck then TFS will not magically make them all better unless you also change your processes.

    Good luck with your convincing…

    I will be running a bunch of demos on a couple of weeks with TFS & Eclipse working together. Although I have a cloud instance that I can connect to, what about when I have no network.

    So I have to get familiar with the interface and what better way to start than to get everything working on Windows 8.

    - **Java Developer Kit**  
       [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    - **Eclipse**  
       [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)  
       I will go with Eclipse Classic, basically because I have little idea of the deference and this is the one I was told to use ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-13-13.png)
      { .post-img }
    - **TFS Plugin for Eclipse**  
       [http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs/preview](http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs/preview)  
       Note: Don’t download this one… you will see why later.

    I have pre-downloaded Java and Eclipse so I just need to copy them to my VM to begin. The JDK is first as nothing will work without it.

    **Figure: First install the JDK**

    Its a really uneventful install that involved lots of “Next” clicking…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Unpack Eclipse**

    Eclipse does not require an install so you just unpack and run… from habit I always drop the Eclipse folder into Program Files. Come on… it gives me warm fuzzies…

    **Figure: Pin Eclipse to Start**

    I want to be able to launch Eclipse without having to find the folder. To add the Eclipse icon to the new Metro interface all you do is right click the executable and “Pin to Start”…

    To make sure that everything is in the right place I want to start Eclipse and connect to TFS.

    **Figure: Install new software**

    I don’t know how Martin Woodward did it but he managed to get Microsoft to host an update site for the Eclipse plugin. I am loading the latest Team Explorer Everywhere preview, but you can get the released version as well.

    - **Team Explorer Everywhere 2010 SP1  
       **[http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs](http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs)
    - **Team Explorer Everywhere 2012** [http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs/preview](http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse/tfs/preview)

    The new version works against Team Foundation Service, TFS 2008, TFS 2010 and TFS 2012 so I feel no compulsion to load anything but the latest and greatest.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Enter the Update site link**

    A couple of clicks later and the plugin will be downloaded and installed by Eclipse.

    **Figure: Auto download and install**

    After the install you will be asked to restart Eclipse and voila, you now have the TFS plugin installed.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Where ma stuff!**

    As the Eclipse plugin follows the Eclipse paradigm if you are looking for the same look and feel of everything presented on a plate for you then you will be disappointed…

    So where is it hiding? How do I get stuff from Version Control?

    **Figure: Import and Export from Version Control**

    But where is my team Explorer?

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Team Explorer**

    Now we just  connect to TFS, in this case I am connecting to the new TFS Preview, but it could just as well be a local TFS 2010 or TFS 2012.

    **Figure: Adding a Team Foundation Server**

    And that's about it. I am no Java expert, but it is like any other Version Control system except I am able to associate my Check-In’s with the work that I was asked to do ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-13-13.png)
    { .post-img }

    So really its way better than just Version Control…

    As I [have mentioned before I run all of my heavy weight software in a VM](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/installing-tfs-2012-on-server-2012-with-sql-2012/). That is one of the reasons that I love Windows 8… I can run Hyper-V. I want to be able to reinstall my local computer quickly, and to get back up and running fast.

    I run many apps on my local computer, but they are things like Outlook, Windows Live Writer, Camtasia, Snagit and Diablo as well as any coms apps I need. I run Visual Studio in a VM so that I can reinstall my host and get back working fast, and I can also reinstall my Visual Studio VM while using my current one ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-10-10.png).
    { .post-img }

    Now VM’s can be slow, so I got me a faster system…

    Figure: Booting Windows 8 on Hyper-V in under 10 seconds

    … Thus I can boot any of my VM’s in 8-15 seconds depending on what I am running. The exceptions I have are older OS’s that don’t support the faster boot model.

    The problem at hand is to create a VM with Visual Studio 2010, but running on Windows 8. I always install on a clean install. I don’t do upgrades as frankly its less painful to figure out how to bite the bullet and reinstall everything efficiently than to take the pain later of errors that I really don’t know wither they are coz of the product or the beta versions of some widget that I used to have two operating systems ago.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Rigel is running Windows 8**

    Unlike the Server 2012 environment I don’t need to Snapshot. I don’t want the overhead and it makes the VM itself un-portable…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Installing Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 8**

    I will be using the VM to both work and demo with Visual Studio 2010 against any version of Team Foundation Server. I have a VM with TFS 2010 and my new one with TFS 2012. I will be doing a full install of 2010 for two reasons. First I don’t know what I will be called upon to demo until I am, sometimes with little or no prep time coz customers like you to “jump to”. Second is that I hate going to use a feature and it wither is not there, or pops a modal dialog asking for a DVD ROM or some other crap. I just want it to work.

    **Figure: The install is running**

    I have often seen teams being required to use an old version of Visual Studio on a newer OS. I see many team using Visual Studio 2008 and even Visual Studio 2005 on Windows 7. I even used to do that myself. These days I tend to be only one version back. I count that from the latest supported version of Visual Studio and since Visual Studio 2012 has been supported in production since the Beta was released I am going with 2010 and 2012 ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-10-10.png)

    Boy but Visual Studio installs fast on SSD’s…

    Well that went a lot smother than I was expecting… I really don’t know what I was expecting, but I am a little disappointed that everything just worked. Nothing for us geeks to fix!

    Now why can’t the SharePoint team get their bits together to be able to do this? I bet I could install Visual Studio 2003 on here with no problems even if MSFT has not tested it. Could you imagine of Office did not work on the new OS? Heads would  roll…

    ### Conclusion

    Running Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 8 not only works, but works well. Don’t be afraid of Windows 8 for Visual Studio’s sake… just jump in and get going…

    I need a TFS environment to use for demos and what better time to do a full upgrade than when we get some nice prizes from Microsoft. Today the Release Candidate for both Windows and for Visual Studio was released to the public. You can download it off the public sites or you can use you MSDN account to get all of the goodies.

    My very favourite feature of Windows 8 is the ability for me to run Hyper-V on the client. So all I need is a nice new “Kraken” server to run.

    **Figure: VM’s Galore (with 3 running)**

    This allows me to be ready to demo in almost any situation without requiring access to the internet. The only thing I really cant demo is Lab Management and I don’t want to have to cart around a data centre like [Brian Rendell](http://mcwtech.com/blogs/brianr/) does.

    I configure all of my VM’s with two network adapters, Public is connected to the internet and Private links all of the VM’s and the Host.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Public is wired to my Internet**

    This allows me to connect to my VM’s with an IP address that I already know, versus having to look up the IP that some DHCP gave it.

    I have three stages to this install that will allow me to have a good demo instance:

    1. Install and Configure Windows Server 2012
    2. Install and Configure SQL Server 2012
    3. Install and Configure TFS 2012

    I need to know how long this stuff takes as I have 2 Team Foundation Server 2012 installs next month. Its in high demand and almost every single customer demo of Visual Studio 2012 I have don has resulted in a customer wanting to “Go-Live”. Yes, its that good and that much of an improvement. One of our customers that is going live on the Release Candidate is a large US Manufacturing company with a projected 40k users in TFS. No hints…

    ### Install and Configure Windows Server 2012 (30 minutes)

    As I want to have a demo box that is all singing and dancing I need to have Server 2012. I will be on the road for the next 3 weeks doing demos and I want to blow folks away with all of the new stuff. Server 2012 is not really for demo but more to frame the demos. I have 2 Windows 8 VM’s for client demos, but some server side bells and whistles always go down well.

    Figure: Currently only Datacenter is available

    Don’t b e afraid of Datacenter, it really just means that it includes all of the features, you don't need to use them all. I will however recommend that you select the GUI mode rather than the Core if this is a demo box. You may only have one box running and it would suck to have to remote into another box just to manage this one. If however you will have many server boxes then the recommended would be to use Core.

    You will likely be familiar with the windows install and it is the same as previous versions, if a little simpler and prettier.

    **Figure: Woooo… new**

    It may be a siney new server, but it does not have a name I would like nor can I connect over Remote Desktop. You might be wondering why I want to use RDP! Well, it has to do with configuration. I get way more options and I don’t have to settle for an ugly 4x3 display. I want everything to be a nice HD 16x9 ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-36-36.png). To achieve that I need to:
    { .post-img }

    1.  **Enable Remote Desktop**
        By default you do not have RDP enabled. It is easy to enable.

            [![image](images/image_thumb10-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image13.png)

        **Figure: Enable Remote Desktop**
        Note: If you are going to connect from a pre Windows 7 computer then you will need to un-tick the “Network Level Authentication” box.

    2.  **Set an IP Address (no DHCP on Windows 8 client)**
        As I do not run DHCP on my Windows 8 box I need to set the IP, this is the way you want to do it anyway for demo boxes so you remember what to connect to.

            [![image](images/image_thumb11-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image14.png)

        **Figure: New name, then reboot**

    Now I can access my new server by name or by IP. I tend to use IP as the name can sometimes go awry as it often can with no Active Directory.

    DONE – Server 2012 installed and configured

    ### Install and Configure SQL Server 2012 (30 minutes)

    I will be install SQL Server 2012 for this box and just like 2008 you can’t just click an Install button, you have to go through a bunch of menus to get there. Not perfect, but they are trying to prevent the average muppet from messing up their system. I however am and exemplary muppet and can mess it up anyway. As I am in a VM, and this may not go well, My first task is to Snapshot my VM. That way if I mess it up I can always try again without having to completely reinstall.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Snapshots can save your bacon**

    You have probably done an install 100 times for SQL server, so I will just note the differences and any problems.

    SQL 2012 has been out for a couple of months so there must be at least 10 Cumulative Updates by now!

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: We are installing a stand-alone instance**

    The installation for SQL is surprisingly uneventful when I do it, but I find that customers tend to ignore the TFS requirements for SQL and just install it the way they always do it.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Pick and Mix**

    I want to be able to choose what is installed, and I certainly don’t want everything.  And, no, you can’t use SQL Server in Power Pivot for SharePoint mode as it is not currently supported. I had a nice long discussion with [Jeff Levinson](http://blog.nwcadence.com/author/jefflevinson/) about this and you certainly don’t want to select that option. I may be Scottish but Jeff can turn the air blue ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-36-36.png)

    **Figure: Select the features**

    As I am creating a server only box I don’t really want any of the client tools for working on this box but I do want the SQL Management tools. I expect to only be logging onto this box to demo server configuration, not client connectivity.

    I should also point out that I am a vanilla kind of guy that believes that there are only two reasons to change the defaults:

    1. The documentation tells me so
    2. Long painful experience

    So, here are the small changes to the default configuration that I do specify:

    1.  **Change default accounts for Active Directory ones**
        If you are wanting to use Kerberos or you have more than one server in your environment then you need AD Accounts. In this case I am leaving it alone and trusting that they guys that wrote the product kew what they were doing.

        **Figure: If you are part of an AD environment use AD accounts**
        _note: I cant stress this enough: **Never change the collation… ever…
        **_

    2.  **Add Administrators or some other group to SQL**
        This is a long painful experience one. Many time I have seen SQL become inaccessible cox and account got changed. Add a group in here…

    DONE – Install and configure SQL Server 2012

    The very last thing you would do, if everything went well is to remove the snapshot. They take up space and require extra processing and disk access to resolve. Not much you understand, but enough that it make sence to clean up after yourself. The purpose of the snapshot was to get back to a stable OS in SQL failed. It installed just fine, so we are all good.

    ### Install and Configure TFS 2012 (30 minutes)

    Now the money shot. I need a all singing and dancing TFS 2012 installation with Reporting and SharePoint. In order for me to back out again I will perform a snapshot so that I can get back to a good state without having to rebuild.

    **Figure: What flavour would you like**

    In this case I want a single box that does everything so “Standard Single Server” looks like the best option. In TFS 2010 this installed SQL Express, but it looks like they have improved the experience and I will give it a go.

    The wizard will lead you through the installation process, but with Standard there are only a few options anyway.

    **Figure: Enter the Reporting & SharePoint account**

    It is a requirement of both SharePoint and Reporting Services that this be a separate account from the one that they are running under. I just created a local administrator account called “TfsServices” that can be used for anything.

    At this point I ran into “TF400079: The amount of RAM on this computer is not sufficient”. What the heck I have tones of RAM…

    [![image](images/image_thumb27-18-18.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image30.png)

    **Figure: TF400079 SharePoint… Ahhhhh….**

    > _TF400079 : The amount of RAM on this computer is not sufficient to support SharePoint 2010 with Team Foundation Server. You must have the following amount of ram available: 4 GB_

    While it is nice that it checking, I have dynamic memory enabled and this server can demand up to 20GB of RAM (that's what I can give it).

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Should demand what it wants and windows shall provide!**

    I need to shutdown the VM to add more memory so lets do that now. I will try to give it 4 GB of start-up memory and se if that does it. It will still be dynamic, but the OS should report as having 4 GB even if it is only using 1 GB. We Will see.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Add Startup RAM to the required amount.**

    Note: Due to SharePoint installing TFS 2010 / TFS 2012 has a minimum 10GB RAM requirement. This goes away with SharePoint. After a reboot we can launch the wizard again.

    **Figure: Validation Checks**

    So without SharePoint everything runs smoothly.

    I should point out that all problems either stem from Reporting Services or SharePoint.

    I can install and configure SharePoint later when someone else has gone through the pain of dealing with the SharePoint team.

    I love the TFS team for not letting me screw up my system because some component part has a problem.

    Once the checks are complete you can go ahead and run the configuration for real. Now while I have had it fail at this point, that occurrence is so rare and the resulting issue so complex that I doubte that you will run into anything like that. That said there is Murphys Law and a very wise wizard once said “1 in a million chances happen 9 times out of 10”.

    And second to check out the web UI.

    **Figure: Web UI works**

    Now you cant create team projects in the '”on-premises” from the portal like you can in TFS Preview, so we will need to wait until I have a client to create one before I can really exercise this puppy. Everything does however look good with no errors…so I am calling it.

    DONE - Install and Configure TFS 2012

    ### Conclusion

    So, no SharePoint on Server 2012. Can’t say I am going to miss it. I have been spending a lot of time on the Team Foundation Service Preview which does not have SharePoint. And you know what. I don’t miss it. I have figured out other less painful ways to store documents (Skydrive, Version Control, SugarSync) that can all be made public, or close to it, which actually makes things easier.

    > You solve a problem with SharePoint, and now you have two problems.

    Good luck with your 2012 deployments, I have a bunch of production upgrades this month (none with Server 2012 as well) so I will keep you posted to any issues or problems.

    If you have ever had to migrate data from any system that contains lots of data and especially history then you will have run into this problem. Effectively you have two choices:

    - **Upgrade with full history, correct dates and uninterrupted reporting**
    - **Migrate with tip/full history with truncated dates and no past reporting**

    This is also the case with Team Foundation Server and every customer that we have that wants to do a migration of data voices the same concern:

    > “We can’t be the first company to make such a request, as financial institutions and other companies need to have the history moved, have it searchable and reportable.”  
    > \-Anonymous Customer

    In order to support little things like Sarbanes Oxley (SOX), CRF11, HIPPA, FDA or NRA you need to, generally, be able to prove tractability from “Source Code | Builds | Tests| Requirements”. You need to be able to show, on demand, how a line of code got into your application, why, who requested it and how it was tested. This is hard at the best of times and impossible most of the time if you have separate systems that all authenticate differently or store data differently.

    [![Visual Studio ALM Tractability Matrix](images/image_thumb4-1-1.png "Visual Studio ALM Tractability Matrix")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image7.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Visual Studio ALM Tractability Matrix**

    Do a test on your software. Pick a like of code and figure out who added it to the system and how it was changed over time. Now, for each of those changes figure out why that change was done and who authorised it. Can you do that?

    Now consider a couple of…modifiers. How sure are you that the system told you the truth? It is is not Active Directory integrated can you really be sure that this is a traceable user? When was the last time that you changed that Visual SourceSafe account password? If it was not in the last 90 days then you may be out of compliance.

    Its not just for enterprises; if your software in any way contributes to the decisions made by executives of public companies then you need to be able to provide that tractability. What about banks? Has your software ever been used by a financial institution to figure out what to do? Yes, that means Excel is covered by SOX and if an algorithm was not interpreted correctly then the SOX folks would be going through the Excel source with a tooth comb.

    Because of these small requirements it is impossible to edit data in the past in Team Foundation Server and indeed to add data to the past. That means that when you do a “migration” and not an “upgrade” you are effectively replaying all of that history at speed against a new instance. All of your dates will be consecutive and be as close together as the API can cope with. This for some is just not good enough. In these circumstance I have to aske them to choose:

    1. **Upgrade in place**
    2. **Migrate to new place**

    Which is more important? Migrating and “starting fresh” with clean data unburdened by legacy fields or Work item Types (can make your cube a little clogged). Or do you require to have all of the dates exactly as they are. This is not a Team Foundation Server thing, or a Microsoft thing but a simple tractability thing and all of the oversight rules mentioned above require it. Really, if you are concocting any sort of Application Lifecycle strategy then you need it too…

    When you migrate however all is not lost. You don’t loose the history of the dates, nor your tractability it is just moved a little and becomes a little less discoverable, but no less traceable. In the case of the TFS Integration Platform you retaining the original date and user in the “history” for work items and the “comment” for source control. While not ideal, it does allow you to maintain that fidelity of history. In addition you can have the TFS Integration Platform retain the ID from the old system and thus you can even keep the old system alive for those infrequent spelunking sessions. If you must retain the integrity of dates then the only option is [Process Template Upgrade #7 – Rename Work Items and Import new ones](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/process-template-upgrade-7-overwrite-retaining-history-with-limited-migration/) and all of the migration options with pros and cons documented on [Upgrading your Process Template in Team Foundation Server](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/) .

    Using method #7 you will be able to:

    - **Move to a single process template**
    - **Retain history and dates in Work Items**
    - **Retain history and dates on Source files**

    You will however NOT be able to:

    - **Consolidate to a single Team Project Collection**
      MSDN: [Visual Studio TFS Team Project and Collection Guidance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983486.aspx)
    - **Remove old fields until their history is no longer required**
      We can rename the legacy Work Item Type Fields so that they all appear as “\[legacy\] My Old Field” until teams no longer need the data. Do you know what your records retention policy is?

    If you need help deciding then there is some Rangers guidance and my aforementioned [Process Template migration](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/) guidance.

    There are a bunch of other workarounds to this that I have discussed on many occasions with customers but they still need to choose … which do you want? Make sure that you look at all of the pros and cons carefully and decide what you want to do. An additional thing to note is that migration is very expensive in time and expertise, so choose carefully.

    A little while ago I was looking into the best options for [upgrading a process template but still keep your data intact](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/), but there is still a little bit of ambiguity on how that is achieved. Although the original list had only #6 options lets look at the #7 option…

    - Update 2013-06-18 [Neno](www.tfsblog.com/) pointed out that the code looks all squirrelly. Unfortunately I have tried a bunch of times to fix this one with no result. To see the code in readable form you can double-click the code blocks.

    In option #7 we basically overwrite our old work items with the new ones. There is a little jiggery-pockery to get everything to align, but it allows us to keep the continuity of both history, field data and work item ID’s.

    ## The Main Event: Upgrading Process Templates (TFS 2005 + TFS 2008 + TFS 2010 + TFS11)

    I have created these instruction for doping the upgrade on “any” Team Foundation Server environment and there will be extra “fiddly” bits depending on the version and what third-party tools you are using.

    WARNING: Always test the process against in a test environment before you move forward with production. Make sure that everyone (and I do mean everyone) logs in a performs a few of their normal tasks against the upgraded process before you go ahead with a production migration. If in doubt then get in touch at [http://www.nwcadence.com](http://www.nwcadence.com) before you get yourself into a mess!

    1.  **Export old work item types**
        The first thing I need to do is list out all of the work items that I have available so that I know which ones I might have to change. In this case I have the Agile 6.0 Process Template, so I have User Story as the main requirement item.

            ```
            witadmin listwitd /collection:http://localhost:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:"FabrikamFiber"
            ```

            With the following result:

            - Task
            - Bug
            - Code Review Request
            - Code Review Response
            - Feedback Request
            - Feedback Response
            - Impediment
            - User Story
            - Shared Steps
            - Test Case

            For each of these work item types that exist in the new template you will need to do a little bit of work, but not much. If you are moving from Agile 4.1, Agile 4.2 or Agile 5.0 you will not have the Feedback & Code Review items to worry about. However if you have customised any of the Work item Types, there will be some tinkering that you need to do.

            For each Work Item Type:

            ```
            witadmin exportwitd /collection:http://localhost:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:"FabrikamFiber" /n:Task /f:c:tempTask_FabrikamFiber_source.xml
            ```

            Save them somewhere you can find them and not get them confused with the new ones.

            [![image](images/image_thumb-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Save out the Work Item Type Definition**

    2.  **Identify fields that do not exist in the new template**

        In this case I am moving from the Task Work Item Type in the MSF Agile 6.0 Template to the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 Template. There are a number of fields that do not appear on the Scrum template that we will likely at least want to keep the data for:

        ```


            Importance to business









            Initial value for Remaining Work - set once, when work begins


            The number of units of work that have been spent on this task


            The date to start the task


            The date to finish the task


        ```

        For every field that has a different “refname” from that which exists in the new Work item Type you will need to add it to the list of fields. This will guarantee that you will still be able to see the history from the old work item type.

    3.  **Add old fields to the new Work Item Type**

        This is very simple and entails adding the fields identified above to the new Work Item Type. This will allow TFS to continue to understand these fields even though you will not be displaying them.

        _note: But do not add them to the UI_

        _note: Even if you forget to add the fields you will NOT loose the data, it will just be hidden until you add the fields._

    4.  **Rename the Work Item Type**
        If the new  work item type has a different name from the new one you will need to perform a rename first.

            [![image](images/image_thumb1-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image1.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: witadmin renamewitd /?**

        ````
        witadmin renamewitd /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:Agile3 /n:"User Story" /new:"Product Backlog Item"

            ```

            This is the point at which you will start to break things. Queries, Reports, Dashboards and the new Agile Planning tools all rely on the Work Item Type name.

            WARNING: Always do this on a test server first before you ever touch production

        ````

    5.  **Update to the new Work Item Types**

        This is real easy, perhaps too easy, and you should make sure that you have all of the fields and that you know all of the impacts.

        ```
        witadmin importwitd /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:Agile3 /f:"c:dataProduct Backlog Item.xml"

        ```

        note: Document everything in a Script so that you make this a repeatable experience

        WARNING: Always do this on a test server first before you ever touch production

    6.  **Update Catagories.xml (TFS 2010+ only)**

        If you are using TFS 2010 or above Microsoft added the idea of categories to make reporting easier to customise.

        ```
        witadmin exportcategories /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:AgileTest3 /f:c:datacats.xml
        ```

        Calling this will dump out the existing categories so that you can edit and import them. For any of the work item types that you rename you will need to update the name in this configuration file.

        ```
        < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>




































        ```

        You can see where User Story is listed in the Requirement Category and you can easily chnage and upload this. It is worth noting that using the “witadmin renamewitd” command will automatically make this change for you. Once we have make any changes necessary we can import it back into TFS and close that loop.

        ```
        witadmin importcategories /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:AgileTest3 /f:c:datacats.xml

        ```

        Note: This is done automatically if you use the “witadmin renamewitd”

        Note: You can export the correct listing from a new clean template if you wish

    7.  **Update the Configuration files (TFS 11+ only)**

        The Agile Configuration is what makes the new Agile Planning features in Team Foundation Server 11 come to life. There is also a Common configuration that will also need to b e set. In this case, because we are moving to a vanilla template we can just export both of them from an existing project and import them into the new project as is.

        - **Agile Process Configuration**

          ```
          witadmin exportagileprocessconfig /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:FabrikamFiber /f:c:dataagileprocess.xml
          ```

          This produces a file that defines what is available on a couple of the agile pages including the Product and Sprint backlog pages.

          ```
          < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
























          ```

        - **Common Processing Configuration**

          ```
          witadmin exportcommonprocessconfig /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /p:FabrikamFiber /f:c:datacommonprocess.xml
          ```

          Which produces a file that defines what the states and names are for each of the work item types as well as formats for how things are displayed. If you want to work weekends, then this is the place to look as well.

          ```
          < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>













































              Sunday
              Saturday


          ```

        And as I mentioned we are moving directly from one to another so we don’t need to make any changes, just import.

    8.  **Update Reports in Reporting Services (TFS 2010 Power Tools+ only)**

        There is a command available from the power tools that will allow you to call one command to upload the new reports. I like to drop all of the old reports into a “\_20XX-\[process\]-reports” folder so that I can always see what we had before. You don’t want to delete any customisation, bot they will likely not work anyway until updated.

        ```
        tfpt addprojectreports  /collection:http://vsalm:8080/tfs/defaultcollection /teamproject:AgileTest3 /processtemplate:"Visual Studio Scrum 2.0"

        ```

        WARNING: All out-of-the-box reports and any customisation will be inoperable until they are updated to take advantage of the new data

    9.  **Migrating Data to new Fields:**
        At this point you have one of two choices. There will be data in field that have just had the reference name changed, like “System.Description” changing to “System.DescriptionHTML”, and we need to decide how to migrate it. Luckily the main fields, like “System.Title” have not changed so the work item will still be identifiable as it was before.

            1. **Automated Migration**

                You can create an application or a script to move data from one field to another. If you are using the API you can even head back in time to pull data from the past.

                ```
                Dim tpc as TfsTeamProjectCollection = New TfsTeamProjectCollection("https://localhost:8080/tfs/defaultcollection")
                Dim store as WorkItemStore = tpc.GetService(of WorkItemStore)
                Dim wi as WorkItem = store.GetWorkItem(21)
                Dim wiAtDate WorkItem = store.GetWorkItem(21, Date.Parse("2012-03-02 08:00"))
                Dim wiRevision as WorkItem = store.GetWorkItem(21, wi.Rev -1)

                ```

                Either of these options will allow you to repopulate data auto-magically and almost transparently to your users.

            2. **Self service migration**

                In the self-service option we let the first user to edit a work item manually do the migration.

                [![image](images/image_thumb2-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/05/image2.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You can select text from the history**
        You can have user peruse t6he history at their leisure and copy any data that they need back into the main work item. This allows for some really complex translations and stops you getting caught up in arguments with users as to what data they want and how it will be converted. Even two teams working in the same project can do it in slightly different ways using the MK1 Eyeball and MK1 Logic System to interpret the results much more effectively than you can.

            And that's almost it! If this is TFS 2010 then you are done, but if it is TFS 11 then there are a couple of other things that you may need to do depending on the breadth of the changes. In my case I am mainly going to be moving from \[insert out-of-the-box template\] or \[insert-frankin-template\] to the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 template so I need to tell the rest of TFS how I am going to be using the data.

    10. DONE – You are now on a new Process Template with minimal baggage

    ### Troubleshooting

    I will try to catalogue any problems here, so add them in the comments and I will update!

    1.  **TF400508: The current process settings are either missing or not valid.**
        If you are on Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server (dev11 | TFS11) then you will need to reconfigure the Planning Boards to work with the new work item types. In this case I have renamed the “User Story” work item type to “Product Backlog Item” and it results in an error.

        **Figure: TF400508 is about Agile Planning boards**
        You forgot to update #7 above. Go back and do it now!

  BodyContent: |
    I have been working a lot recently with the new Team Foundation Service (TFS Preview) that Microsoft is providing in Azure. I was building an application called TFS Field Annotate that allows you to spelunk a fields changes. One of the problems I ran into is how to Unit Test this. I have been doing a lot of work in Test Driven Development (TDD) recently and after running a Bowling Kata (thanks David Starr) for the last month I don’t want to work any other way.

    **Updated 2012-04-02 - [Patrick Carnahan](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/patcarna/) fixed my code below to work with TFS 11 on both local and build server environments.**

    This brings us back to the purpose here. Lets take a standard API call to TFS:

    ```
    TfsTeamProjectCollection collection =new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri("https://mrhinsh.tfspreview.com/DefaultCollection"));
    collection.Authenticate();

    ```

    **Figure: Simply connect to TFS**

    Before the cloud we had 3 options for authentication:

    1. Run the code/application as a user with permission
    2. Add the credentials to the credential store
    3. Pass in explicit credentials to use

    While this was just fine, what do you do in the cloud world where authentication was done using Windows Live ID. What do you do if you want to run a service, like the TFS Integration Platform, unattended? Well, up until now we had to log onto that unattended server and re-jig our Live credentials every two days when it expired.

    Now while this is OK, but not ideal, for a while what about things like Build Servers running locally and connecting to the cloud or even just something as simple as writing Unit Tests that test an application you are building against TFS Service.

    This happened to me the other day while I was working on the [TFS Field Annotator](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-field-annotator/) that I was building.  I was trying to add some Unit Tests and I was running into authentication issues.

    note: I know I am supped to ad my Tests first, but I am not quire there yet.

    note: I am also aware that these are “Integration Tests” and not pure “Unit Test”

    The authentication issues stemmed from the code above in the automated running scenario and resulted in and error…

    [![image](images/image_thumb-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/04/image.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: TF30064: You are not authorized to access the server**

    So, why do I get this error when I am in a Unit Test and not connecting through the custom UI.  Well, in the UI the user is specifically selecting the Collection using the TeamProjectPicker dialog. This dialog does all of the Live ID authentication for us so if the user ticks the “remember me” box they don’t have to log in next time.

    [![SNAGHTML1718e02a](images/SNAGHTML1718e02a_thumb-4-4.png "SNAGHTML1718e02a")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/04/SNAGHTML1718e02a.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: the UI authenticated us**

    That bring us back to the problem at hand. The UI is not involved with the Unit Tests. In fact I have abstracted the logic for the TeamProjectPicker into a collection selector interface so that I can run the Unit Tests without having the UI popup ever time I run them…

    ```
    namespace TfsWitAnnotateField.UI.Infra
    {
        public interface ICollectionSelector
        {
            TfsTeamProjectCollection SelectCollection();
        }
    }

    ```

    **Figure: An Interface to abstract the UI work**

    Having this interface lets me have two implementation of a concrete class.

    1. CollectionSelector – With the call to TeamProjectPicker UI

       ```
       namespace TfsWitAnnotateField.UI.Infra
       {
           class CollectionSelector : ICollectionSelector
           {
               public TfsTeamProjectCollection SelectCollection()
               {
                   using (TeamProjectPicker tpp = new TeamProjectPicker(TeamProjectPickerMode.NoProject, false))
                   {
                       DialogResult result = tpp.ShowDialog();
                       if (result == DialogResult.OK)
                       {
                           return tpp.SelectedTeamProjectCollection;
                       }
                       return null;
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```

       **Figure: Calling the TeamProjectPicker  
       **

    2. MockCollectionSelector – With an explicit Collection to tests against and no UI

       ```
       namespace TfsWitAnnotateField.UI.Tests
       {
           class MockCollectionSelector : ICollectionSelector
           {
               public TfsTeamProjectCollection SelectCollection()
               {
                   return new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri("https://mrhinsh.tfspreview.com/"));
               }
           }
       }

       ```

    Now here in #2 we have a problem. How do we authenticate?

    The only way to do so up until now was to save your Live ID credentials in the Windows Credential Store, but they would only last for 2 days before they expired.

    So what happens on the build server?

    I would have to log onto the build serve every 2 days and reset the credentials, and my only notification would be that my tests started failing, and thus my builds. Not a good thing.

    In a self-hosted TFS instance I can just create some AD credentials and hard code (or put them in a config) them. But in the Hosted Build Service world I have no such option. I don’t even know where my build server is, let alone logging onto it. So the lovely folks on the product team, encountering the same problem themselves, came up with a solution.

    You can connect to your TFS Preview instance as an Administrator and load a set of service credentials that you can use to connect unattended.

    ```
    IAccessControlService acs = _SelectedTeamProjectCollection.GetService();
    ServiceIdentity defaultServiceIdentity = acs.ProvisionServiceIdentity();
    // Save these values off to use for non-interactive login
    Username = defaultServiceIdentity.IdentityInfo.Name;
    Password = defaultServiceIdentity.IdentityInfo.Password;

    ```

    **Figure: Retrieving a non-interactive login for your TFS Preview service**

    Now, it would be a pain in the ass to have to spin up this code all of the time, so I created the [TFS Service Credential Viewer](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/tfs-service-credential-viewer/) that will do the heavy lifting for you.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: We can load out credentials from the remote instance**

    Now I can copy and past them into my MockCollectionSelector to allow it to connect unattended.

    ```
    namespace TfsWitAnnotateField.UI.Tests
    {
        class MockCollectionSelector : ICollectionSelector
        {
            public TfsTeamProjectCollection SelectCollection()
            {
                // This is constructed with the userName and password from the previous code block
                ServiceIdentityCredentialsProvider provider = new ServiceIdentityCredentialsProvider("Account Service (XXXXXX)", "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
                return new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri("https://mrhinsh.tfspreview.com/DefaultCollection"), provider);
            }
        }
    }

    ```

    **Figure: CollectionSelector for TFS 2010**

    ```
    namespace TfsWitAnnotateField.UI.Tests
    {
        class MockCollectionSelector : ICollectionSelector
        {
            public TfsTeamProjectCollection SelectCollection()
            {
                return new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri("https://mrhinsh.tfspreview.com/"), new TfsClientCredentials(new SimpleWebTokenCredential("", "")));
            }
        }
    }

    ```

    **Figure: CollectionSelector for TFS 2012**

    Now that I have my credentials I can run my tests again…

    Woot, they all pass… now to write some more.

    ### Conclusion

    If you are using a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework to tests your scenarios (SpecFlow works well with Visual Studio 2012) then you will need to load your service credentials so that we can test without having a user enter credentials…

    If you want to connect to the Team Foundation Service (TFS Preview) API you are going to need some credentials in order to connect. That's right, where do you expect to store your Live ID for connecting? Do you expect to add it to the windows credentials store? What about having the user manually add it? Both these options suck… so introducing the TFS Service Credential Viewer.

    [![image](images/image_thumb21-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image21.png)
    { .post-img }

    The TFS Service Credential Viewer connects to your Team Foundation Service account on [http://tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com) and using your credentials it retrieves credentials that you can use for an automated service to connect and authenticate correctly.

    ### Download TFS Service Credential Viewer

    The following prerequisites are required:

    - Team Explorer 2012 Visual Studio 11 (any version)
    - .NET 4.5

    If these components are already installed, you can [launch](http://nkdagility.com/downloads/tools/tfs2012/TfsServiceCredentialViewer/TfsServiceCredentialsUI.application) the application now. Otherwise, click install below to install the prerequisites and run the application.

    #### [install](http://nkdagility.com/downloads/tools/tfs2012/TfsServiceCredentialViewer/setup.exe) or [launch via clickonce](http://nkdagility.com/downloads/tools/tfs2012/TfsServiceCredentialViewer/TfsServiceCredentialsUI.application)

    ### How it works

    Once you have authenticated as a TFS Collection Administrator to your hosted TFS Collection we use the Access Control Service to provision a service identity that you can use for unattended connections to Team Foundation Service (TFS Preview).

    ### Troubleshooting

    If you are using Windows 8 Consumer Preview you will not get an automatic launch of the application due to an extra security check for applications that come from the internet.

    1.  Click or Press “Start” and Scroll all the way to the right
    2.  Select the TFS Service Credential Viewer
    3.  When the security dialog pops up click “More Info”

    Do you make lots of edits to your TFS Work Items? Do you ever look at a field in the UI and think…

    > last time I looked that was a 4? Why is it a 6? Who changed it?

    if you have, then the TFS Field Annotate is for you. Connect to TFS, select a Work Item and see the history on a single field.

    - Update 2013-01-16 - Now with added [James Tupper](http://blog.nwcadence.com/author/jamestupper/) features. James updated my code to include the ability to select multiple fields from TFS.

    The TFS Field Annotator shows you just the changes to a particular field. So like the Source Code Annotate it gives you line level tractability with ease.

    ### Download TFS Field Annotator

    The following prerequisites are required:

    - Visual Studio 2015 (any version)
    - .NET 4.5

    I was recently in [Park City, Utah to teach](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/professional-scrum-foundations-in-salt-lake-city-utah/) the [Professional Scrum Foundations](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/) course and i just got an email from one of the students. As I want to help everyone I will answer here:

    > If I recall from our training, you suggested teams could burn down their sprints using points or hours.  In your view is there a “better” answer in your opinion (pros/cons)?  
    > \-Pete

    The first thing that we want to do is define explicitly what a burndown represents and the reason that we are creating one; i.e. what actions might we want to take. Only then can we decide what we want to measure and which is best for us.

    ## What is a burndown?

    During Sprint Planning the Development Team forecast what work it thinks it could do (selected a number of PBI's from the Product Backlog) and created a Plan to complete them. This is known as the Sprint Backlog and it should have some measure of Remaining Work that allows the Development Team to see what they have left to do. As the Sprint Backlog (the Plan to complete the forecast PBI's) evolves as more is known over the course of the Sprint the Remaining Work can vary and we need a way of visualizing trends so that the Development Team can take the necessary action.

    > A burndown is a visual representation of the Remaining Work in the Sprint Backlog as it varies over time.

    ## What might we find?

    So in order to identify actions we need to look at some things we might identify as a problem.

    - **We get a flat burndown**  
       [![SNAGHTMLc5b675a](images/SNAGHTMLc5b675a_thumb-2-2.png "SNAGHTMLc5b675a")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/SNAGHTMLc5b675a.png)  
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: What does a flat burndown mean?**
      This might be because we just forgot, or it might be representative of a tooling issue or even a team issue that exists.

          - Action: Update our Remaining Work

          - Action: Get better at filling it out in time for the Daily Scrum

          - Action: Raise an impediment to the Scrum Master to improve the tools

          - Action: Raise an impediment to the Scrum Master to help the Development Team improve

    - **We get a perfect burndown, but delivered nothing**  
       [![SNAGHTMLc5cb8e3](images/SNAGHTMLc5cb8e3_thumb-3-3.png "SNAGHTMLc5cb8e3")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/SNAGHTMLc5cb8e3.png)  
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: All of the Tasks were complete**
      This is likely to be because we have too much work in progress at any one time. We have 10 Stories in progress and get to the end of the Sprint with all of our Stories 90% complete.

          - Action: Raise an impediment with the Scrum Master for review at the Retrospective

          - Action: Limit work in progress

              _"Given an ordered list of user stories, **you’re either working on the top item, or else you’d better have a good reason not to**. You don’t proceed with another story until your current story is done."
              _\-[The Task Burn Down Trap: everything finished, nothing done](http://blog.xebia.com/2008/09/19/the-task-burn-down-trap-everything-finished-nothing-done/)

    - We will not get done on time  
       [![SNAGHTMLc5fc66a](images/SNAGHTMLc5fc66a_thumb-4-4.png "SNAGHTMLc5fc66a")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/SNAGHTMLc5fc66a.png)  
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: When will we be done?**
      This can be because we do not know everything at the start of the Sprint. Can a lawyer tell you exactly how long your case will take and what it will cost? No, so why would you expect something like software to?

          - Action: Speak to the Product Owner and decide what can be removed from the Sprint Backlog to still allow the team to be done.

    These are just some ideas of what might be found and are not indicative of all possible options and there are other lists of [Bad Smells of the Sprint Backlog](http://scrumcrazy.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/bad-smells-of-the-sprint-backlog/) that you can find online.

    Let me reiterate, that along with the Three Questions that are part of the Daily Scrum a Burndown is just a tool to help elicit communication and understanding within the Development Team. It is not a whip for a Project Manager to crack.

    ## What burndown is right?

    So to answer the question of wither to burn down Story Points, Hours or even Test Cases I would argue that we need them all! I want to see if my tasks are on track, but I also want to make sure that I am delivering Stories as well.

    **The Hours Burndown**

    This burndown is good for helping the Development Team identify how much work is remaining in the Sprint and if they are likely to still be able to meet their Sprint Goal.

    **The Story Point Burndown**

    Good for allowing the Development Team to see if they are actually getting things Done, verses completing all of the Tasks.

    **The Acceptance Tests Burndown**

    Also a good indicator of what is going on from a delivery perspective. If you are on track for Hours, and Story Points but you have only completed 50% of your Acceptance Tests and you have 2 days left on your Sprint, what does that tell you about your quality.

    ## Conclusion

    You will need to experiment with your Scrum Teams to see which burndown is right for you, but I would suggest that you want to be able to plot all of them so that your Development Team’s have all of the relevant information for their Daily Scrum to  help them identify any issues as early as possible.

    This week I have been filling in for [David Starr](http://elegantcode.com/author/dstarr/) at a customer and it has been an experience. David had a family emergency and tapped me of all people to take the gig from him. So not only did [Northwest Cadence](http://blog.hinshelwood.com) have to rearrange my schedule to make sure that I could do this, but I had to brave Salt Lake City and Utah…

    [![image](images/image_thumb14-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image14.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Warm sunny Park City, Utah**

    Little did I realise that the Big Yin (Mr Starr) had a few surprises for me. The first surprise was that this was a team of Java developers and that I would be leading an [Agile Engineering Practices Workshop](http://elegantcode.com/author/dstarr/ "Agile Engineering Practices Workshop") as part of the engagement. But that was not all…no, David left the best one until I was well and truly committed…

    I knew that I would have to spin up on the [Professional Scrum Foundations course](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/ "Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF)") but that was just a mater of course, but the real sledge hammer came in the form of 68 students… um…no, that is not a type, it was 68 students over two runs of the two day course. Phew, but this is going to be fun…

    [![image](images/image_thumb15-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image15.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: 32 people make a crowded room**

    I had not taught the [Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/ "Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF)") course from Scrum.org before but David did a walkthrough at the last Face-2-Face and I had spun up on the course before. I was really excited as I think that this is a fantastic course. I had only the beginnings of an understanding of how good this course is before I taught it, but now this is the [one course I would recommend](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/) for any agile or Scrum adoption.

    It is by far the most well thought out course that it has been my pleasure to teach. It may just have been the awesome students, but I think that David has excelled himself here and whomever gets custodianship of the course next has large boots to fill.

    On of the main goals of this course is to give teams practical knowledge of what they can achieve when they work as a team using Scrum. Thus there is a backlog of work that we actually ask students to work though and produce product by the end.

    They initially don’t think that they can build anything in 30 minutes, but as they go through the sprints they suddenly find that not only can they build something in 30 minutes, but that if they work together they can do anything. I don’t tell them anything about “how” I want them to complete the backlog and I leave them to figure it out.

    [![SNAGHTMLdb0235](images/SNAGHTMLdb0235_thumb-10-10.png "SNAGHTMLdb0235")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/SNAGHTMLdb0235.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: What can you build in four 30 minute Sprints?**

    At first all but one team was building a home grown solution and finding difficulty in dealing with the bottleneck of having one or two programmers to a team. By the end of the second Sprint all but one team were using Wordpress… Why?

    **The power of the Review & Retrospective!**

    Some of the power in these events is the understanding and cross pollination of good ideas. If you hear about a good experience that another team has encountered then you are likely to at least consider replicating it. Conversely, if you hear about a Sprint peppered by pain and suffering you are likely to want to know what not to try and do!

    So, don’t be a jackass and learn not just from your own mistakes, but the shared mistakes of your organisation.

    All in I think I had 13 teams so you can imagine the differences of skills and knowledge that were involved. Some teams has Scrum boards.

    Some teams stood up during their Daily Scrum.

    Other teams were always asking the Product Owner for more information and some Product Owners spent all of their time grooming the backlog. Only one team had both.

    At the end of the course, for the last sprint I had two curve balls to throw. The first was an integration exercise that really makes them sweat, the other was to introduce some common team dysfunctions. During Lunch I solicited a few moles to play the roll of the “hero” or the “absentee product owner” among other. All of these dysfunctions were not only noticed, but we spent some time looking at how this impacted the teams and what they did about it. All of them self-organised around it and non of them failed to deliver.

    I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Utah and I look forward to going back and helping these fine folks out again. It was an eye-opening experience teaching so many, and I cheated a little for the TDD demonstration of the Engineering practices workshop and I did all of the demos in c#. While it felt a little bit like cheating, I did have 7 or 8 people following along, even one in Perl.

    Are you a professional developer? Do you get an MSDN from your organisation? Did you know that you can use it at home on both commercial and open source projects of your own!

    > MSDN subscriptions are licensed on a **per-user basis**.  One person can use the software to design, develop, test, or demonstrate his or her programs on **any number of devices**.  Each person who uses the software this way needs a license.  
    > \-[MSDN Licencing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx)

    That's right, the MSDN that you company bought you entitles you to run Windows, Office & Visual Studio in production at home. Its a licence for YOU and not just for them.

    **Figure: Over 11 terabytes of data on MSDN**

    I was talking to [Mark Groves](https://twitter.com/mgroves84) at the MVP Summit and I had a double-take when he mentioned that most developers don’t know that you get a take-home licence with you MSDN. I was surprise because I have know and taken advantage of this for the better part of 8 years, and I was even more surprised when he mentioned that [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) was also unaware of this. This is an awesome benefit to being a Microsoft developer and I can’t believe that it is not more well known.

    **Figure: You get Azure time as well**

    On top of that you get a number of other benefits. You get the Azure time above and you also get the ability to run an almost limitless number of development boxes as well. Basically for a developer with MSDN you can almost run “whatever” at home and be fully licenced and I have never encountered anyone who has maxed out their instances.

    The thing that I tend to find that is not done is the assignment of MSDN licences that a company has bough to the individuals that are using it. What companies really don’t understand is that no matter how many MSDN licences that they own, they are not licenced to use any of it unless they are assigned to individual Live ID’s.

    > MSDN subscriptions are **only offered per individual**, there are no “team” subscriptions or sharing of subscription benefits.  
    > \-[MSDN Licencing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx)

    In most companies that I do work for the operations team hoards the MSDN’s so those pesky developers can’t download on the network. But this, my dear ops guys means that you are using software illegally within your company, so get over it and assign those  MSDN subscription to those that they were bought for!

    Did you EVER have an MSDN? Another of those little known things about an MSDN is that it is perpetual. That is that you can use forever the software that became available when you received your MSDN.

    > In most cases, MSDN subscriptions come with **“perpetual” use rights**—the ability to continue using the software after the subscription has expired, even though the ability to download software and product keys ends when the subscription expires.  
    > \-[MSDN Licencing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx)

    You just don’t get anything new ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-4-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    And just in case you were worries about buying licences for your business acceptance testing (BAT) then:

    > When software development projects are nearing completion, an MSDN subscription license also **allows your end users to access the software to perform acceptance tests** on your programs.  
    > \-[MSDN Licencing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx)

    MSDN has one of the most flexible licencing terms in the industry and you should be using it to its full potential and not leaving it on a shelf! It will make some of your developers more valuable if they can exercise the tools in their spare time and the others just will not take advantage of it.

    At the MVP Summit I was appalled by the number of people who asked questions about new features for supporting hierarchical _tasks_! I shared a disgusted look with [Peter Provost](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterprovost/) and we had a quick (and I mean really quick) conversation that resulted in this post. it really comes down to one thing:

    > You can't stack rank hierarchical work items?

    If you want to continue to be competitive in the world of modern software development you need to be able to effectively order (stack rank) a list of well understood items. This could be at the PBI (or Product Backlog) level or it could be at the Task (or Sprint Backlog) level but I need to be able to do that ordering by moving things about... how do I do that with a tree?

    [![image](images/image_thumb1-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image1.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: How do you order a tree?**

    No really! Lets look at a couple of specific questions:

    - **What do you expect to happen when you reorder “PBI 3” above?**
      [![image](images/image_thumb2-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image2.png)
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: If you said they all move then you get a prize**

    This has to be the expected out come because of that pesky parent / child relationship.

    - **What would you expect to happen when you drag “PBI 8” to be between “PBI 1”  and “PBI 2”?**
      [![image](images/image_thumb3-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image3.png)
      { .post-img }
      **Figure: Was that what you expected?  
       **  
       If you said that it would move to the right location then you also get a prise, but what do you think happened to the parent relationship with “PBI 3”? Thats right, it was removed as that item can no longer exist as a child or “PBI 3”…
      _Note: You can keep the relationship by creating it as a “related” relationship, or you could add a custom one._

    So what is the expected behaviour when you discover a PBI that is too large (for whatever reason) and you want to break it down into two smaller ones. Once you have broken a PBI down into two smaller ones that encompass all of the things we need to make the larger one what purpous does it solve… have we not just replaced it? Well then, lets remove it.

    [![image](images/image_thumb4-6-6.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image4.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: ![](images/metro-icon-tick-13-13.png) Good example, Mark the parent story as removed**
    { .post-img }

    This only makes sense as I have all of the relevant information in the two new PBI's.

    [![image](images/image_thumb5-7-7.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image5.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Now I have no “PBI 3”**

    If I look at the history for that “removed” PBI I can, and I will, be able to see all of the history including that the links to the children still exist. This means that you can still query and see what those relationships were without them interfering with the backlog any more.

    [![image](images/image_thumb6-8-8.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image6.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: I can still have my tractability**

    Let me jus say that I am not suggesting that you do not use linking, there are many links that are and should be available. Which of those links are good to use,  provide value and make sense  for both the team and your product owners:

    1.  **Tasks with a Parent / Child relationship with a PBI  
         **  
         You need for your team to be able to keep track of the work that they are doing to achieve a single PBI and this is that. There are other options, but this is the best one.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: ![](images/metro-icon-cross-12-12.png) Bad example, do not use PBI’s as children of other PBI’s**
        { .post-img }

    - **Test Cases with a Tests / Tested By relationship with a PBI**

          You want to be able to trace from code to requirements to bugs all with the relevant tests that make sure that we built the correct thing.

          [![image](images/image_thumb8-10-10.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image8.png)

      { .post-img }
      **Figure: ![](images/metro-icon-tick-13-13.png) Good example, You can show what your PBI is Tested By**
      { .post-img }

    - **Bugs that have a Tests / Tested By**
      I would expect this to be a no-brainer as you can’t have a bug unless you can prove that it exists. Bugs have “steps to reproduce2 after all and in the post MTM world this is the result of a failing Test Case.

          [![image](images/image_thumb9-11-11.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image9.png)

      { .post-img }
      **Figure: ![](images/metro-icon-tick-13-13.png) Good example, Bugs have test Cases too**
      { .post-img }

    I a using the Visual Studio Scrum 2.0 template (default) so while you can make things more complicated, this is about as complex and the expected common cause use cases go with Work Items. There are other artefacts links to support things like Test Results, Code Reviews, Feedback Results and others, but they are tool bits not really that user configurable.

    [![image](images/image_thumb10-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image10.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: ![](images/metro-icon-cross-12-12.png) Bad example, nesting Work Items is very unwieldy**
    { .post-img }

    I am always interested in finding out what other scenarios there are out there:

    Do you agree?

    What reasons do you have for using hierarchy's?

    Upgrading from Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server to Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server beta is very easy and as we have seen, [fully supported in production](http://blog.nwcadence.com/go-live-with-visual-studio-11-beta-3/). Today I got the new bits and I an going to upgrade our Northwest Cadence production server.

    You need a couple of things before you get started:

    - **Admin on your Team Foundation Server environments**  
       That includes your data tier and app tiers
    - **Your TFS account details**  
       This means TFSService & TFSReports accounts at the least.
    - **Download Updates**

    - SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 (Windows Update)
    - [SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 CU1 (Download here)](http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/SQL%20Server%202008%20R2/sp1/SQLServer2008R2_SP1_CU1_2544793_10_50_27/10.50.2769.0/free/434892_intl_x64_zip.exe "http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/SQL%20Server%202008%20R2/sp1/SQLServer2008R2_SP1_CU1_2544793_10_50_27/10.50.2769.0/free/434892_intl_x64_zip.exe")

    Here is my TODO list for this install:

    - **DONE - Unpacking Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
    - **DONE -** **Uninstalling Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server**
    - **DONE -** **Installing Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
    - **DONE -** **Upgrading SQL Server 2008 R2 to SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1**
    - **DONE -** **Apply SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 CU1**
    - **DONE -** **Upgrading to Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
    - **DONE -** **Test your environment**
    - **Email Everyone in your company to go check**

    Once you have those things you can move on to the good bits:

    1.  **Unpacking Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
        This is one of the longest processes as you need to unpack over 1gb of data from your ISO. I use [WinRAR](http://rarlabs.com), but you can use anything you like.

            [![image](images/image_thumb10-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image10.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Unpacking Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server ISO**
        Yes, you heard me right, its only a 1GB iso for TFS11. The team has done some amazing work pairing down the install (It was over 2GB in 2010.)

    2.  **Uninstalling Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server**
        When you run the install on a box that has Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server you will need to uninstall it first. But don’t worry, all you data will be left alone.

            [![image](images/image_thumb11-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image11.png)

        { .post-img }

        This is an easy process and is completed in a couple of minutes.

        **Figure: Its an easy thing to Uninstall**
        Once it is off you computer you can start with the Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server upgrade.

    3.  **Installing Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
        Installing TFS 11 is quick and easy. It takes only a few minutes, although you may need to make sure that you have the latest updates and service packs for all of the affected products as I would always recommend that you do.

        You will see that even the Install has become cleaner and less cluttered. This may change when for the release, but it looks pretty good.

        Always prep the machines with .NET prior to starting if you can. If you do that, you are doing this in minutes.

        After that the install automatically starts after you log in and carries on.

        **Figure: After the install the the configuration window will pop**
        Now that you have everything installed you need to begin the configuration. In TFS 2010 you had to stop here and install the Service Pack but as we just got these bits there is no SP, so … wooohooo..Done.

    4.  **Upgrading to Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server**
        But not really. Now we need to get to the real hard stuff. I am upgrading our current TFS 2010 server, so I need to select the Upgrade Wizard. There are many other options but I don’t need them for now.

            [![image](images/image_thumb20-11-11.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image20.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Select “Upgrade | Start Wizard” to get going**
        Once you get into the wizard you will only see the options and be lead through the story that you want. Make sure that you select the correct story, and often the “Advanced” wizard is the most appropriate.

            [![image](images/image_thumb21-12-12.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image21.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: The only options for Upgrade is to select the database**
        You need access to the database server for the next bit.The upgrade wizard is going to upgrade the schema of your server and you need “sysadmin” in order to do that. I forgot and had to get [Steven Borg](http://blog.nwcadence.com/author/stevenborg/) to add me.

            [![image](images/image_thumb22-13-13.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image22.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Select your TFS 2010 database**
        The wizard will check to make sure that you have a data base that you can import. It will list all of your DB’s but you can only do one through the interface. There is a command line for upgrading subsequent databases if you have more than one configuration database.

            note: You only need to do this ONCE per TFS Instance and not per team Project Collection. It will upgrade all of your collections.

            You then need to specify the TFS Service account to use. Now I forgot this as well and had to ask [Shad Timm](https://twitter.com/#!/shadtimm) (get a blog Shad) to get the password , which he provided with the speed that only Shad can.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Configure the TFS Service Account**
        I have very few circumstances where anything other then NTLM is not appropriate and as we have a separate data tier and app tier I have to use AD credentials. To be honest every time that I have used “network service” I have run into many problems. Just suck it up and use AD Credentials.

        **Figure: We are going to configure reporting**
        If you have TFS basic (or express) then you don’t get reporting, but this is an enterprise solution that has both reporting services and analysis services to configure.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Select the server that is running Reporting Services**
        In my case Reporting Services runs on the same server as the App Tier and it prepopulates the data. Remember that we already selected a TFS 2010 configuration database, so everything except the accounts is pre populated.

        Each collection is upgraded individually after the configuration database has been completed and these again depend on the size and complexity. In this case the first collection has very little data and was upgraded quickly, but the second one is the main collection so will take a little longer.

    With the launch of Visual Studio 11 beta and that it is [fully supported in production](http://blog.nwcadence.com/go-live-with-visual-studio-11-beta-3/) I wanted to update my laptop with the bits. I have a presentation on Friday of [what's new in Visual Studio 11](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/events/) and I will show some of the new features there.

    **Figure: The new installer is clean**

    There has been some comment on the colours, or lack there of, in the new UI, but to be honest it works. It may be a little drab for the first wee while, but once you get used to it you begin to love it. It a user interface for every day use, not occasional use.

    [![image](images/image_thumb41-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image41.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Installation is painless with no configuration**

    lets face it, you don’t need to configure the install and now that the team has paired it down to only 1.6GB we can have it all and not worry about space.

    **Figure: All components get on there but it may take a while**

    It took a little while, perhaps 30 minutes.

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Shucks, another re-boot!**

    I don’t know why, but it did not have any extra bits to do so hopefully they will be able to install without a reboot if you already have .NET 4.5 as I did.

    Figure: Pick your layout

    You get a bunch of first run layouts with Visual Studio 11 and you even get a “code only” minimal one for web development. But I like the “Visual Basic” layout. Note that this is not picking a language it is just picking a layout of Visual Studio IDE. You can customise everything later.

    **Figure: Sigh, and another progress bar**

    While Visual Studio configures itself you need to wait, but only for a few minutes…and then…

    { .post-img }
    **Figure: The new UI**

    I really like the clean new UI. Colour is now for accent and not just for splashing around the place (although that is a running joke at the MVP Summit) and almost all things that have colour you can click!

    When you do a lot of editing in Excel you will sometimes make mistakes. If you are in the unfortunate situation that ended up publishing back changes to 100+ work items that you did not want to change then you can be in a world of hurt. I have a customer who has done just that and I thought some guidance on how to fix (mitigate) this situation will help everyone.

    - **UPDATE 2012-02-26: There is some "undocumented features" described bellow that limit the ability to run time based queries in anything but the API (see WARNINGS below)**
    - **UPDATE 2012-02-28: This solution no longer works with Visual Studio. You can only [run this when calling the API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb130306.aspx). This means that the ONLY way to back out changes made to Work Items is by writing code. So "Solution 2" will not want.**

    My customer is understandably worried and wants to get this resolved, but lets get something out in the open first.

    This will not be easy to fix and may require to be fixed manually. TFS is an auditable system and as such it, unlike many other tools, records the value of every field at every point in time. This means that our data in in there, it is just under the layer of crap that we dumped on top of it. the problem lies in that TFS does not know that it was crap, and it needs to keep the auditors happy, so there is no way to revert changes to work items.

    This is the same for Source Code as well and what a “revert” really means is “get the version we want and overwrite the latest with that version”. In the Source Control world with atomic check-ins there is a tool for that, but in the work item world where all of the work items are being changed independently there is not.

    ### Problem 1

    > There was an error when I published my spreadsheet to TFS forcing multiple field to be changed erroneously.  I need to effectively revert such changes (in items below).   Please provide me guidance as the most efficient way to do this.   For the most part, it looks like I changed all those fields that were in the query I used, making a disalignment of the TFS ID and the data therein.  Here are the fields from the spreadsheet that supposedly is causing this issue:
    >
    > - ID
    > - Customer
    > - Keywords
    > - Title 1
    > - Title 2
    > - Title 3
    > - State
    > - Priority
    > - Assigned To
    > - Original Estimate
    > - Completed Work
    > - Iteration Path
    > - Discipline
    > - Work Item Type
    >
    > \-From my Customer

    Now, I don’t know how much of a misalignment has occurred on the data, but I do see one thing that complicates things. You can see the “Title 1”, “Title 2” and “Title 3“. This allows Excel to understand hierarchical items and also allows you to add items as children of a parent.

    If you add a row with the title in “Title 2” after a row that has its title in “Title 1” then that row will be a child of the preceding row. Convoluted I know, but it is the best that Excel can do. back to the problem. If these fields have been jumbled then we will have to manually check and fix every work item. We may have to find and fix all of the changes manually anyway, but it is far easier to fix fields than hierarchy.

    I would also note that the state transitions have also been changed and as we can’t turn back the clock (we mentioned that pesky auditability above) then we will need to understand that **we have done irreparable damage to our historical reporting for the affected data**.

    ### Problem 2

    When the fields were changed it removes things from your queries that are relying on those fields. This is easy to solve, and looking at the state changed date does get us part of the way there.

    ### Solution 1 – Find those missing work items

    This is the easiest thing to do. Father than looking at the “State Changed” field we can look at the “Changed Date” field instead. On top of that, if you have a system with many users making changes and your problem timeframe is quite large (the above data in Problem 2 is over 30 minutes) then we need to also add a “Changed By” coefficient that can be an individual user, or you can use “@Me” keyword to allow anyone to run this query.

    1.  **Copy Original Query**

        Create a copy of the original query from “Problem 1” so we get the same columns. We will use this later to fix the data.

    2.  **Add Changed By**

        Add the “Changed By” column and use the “Was Ever” operator in conjunction with the “@Me” keyword to your query

        Note: This will pick up all of the changes even if they have since been changed by someone else.

    3.  **Change sort order**
        Add the “Changed Date” column and order by Descending

            Note: This will make sure that all of the most recent changes are at the top

            [![image](images/image_thumb8-2-2.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image8.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Add the first two fields to find the right data**

    4.  **Add date range**
        Add a clause to the “Changed Date”  field to show changes between “2/24/2012 11:30:00 AM” and “2/24/2012 12:10:00 PM”

            Note: If you know the date/time range of the erroneous changes then you can add a filter to reduce your data set, of you don’t you can use the work item history to find it. Just look on the history tab to see when the changes in question occurred.

            ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002_thumb-1-1.jpg "clip_image002")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You will see all of the history values**

    You can use this to figure out the scope of the carnage. You should see both “Link” changes (i.e. changes to the hierarchy) and field changes in the list.

    You should now be able to see all of the current values of the data with the same columns as wen the problem occurred, but it will now include all of the data.

    At this point we have all of the information that we need to fix all of the data one work item at a time. This however would be a little time consuming depending on the number of changes that have been made…

    …hold on… I have an idea…

    ### Solution 2 – Bulk fix on the data

    There is a little known and little used feature of Work Item Query Language (WIQL) that may be able to help us out called “As of” querying.

    _WARNING: This will NOT fix any hierarchy issues as it is not supported on a “tree query”. They will need to be fixed manually!_

    Lets look at the general query syntax.

    > **select** **from** WorkItems \[**where** \] \[**order by** \] \[**asof**\]

    You can see the “asof” addition at the end of the options, well we need to add “asof ‘2/24/2012 11:30:00 AM’” to the end of the query so we can get the Excel sheet to show us what we want our fields to be.

    _**WARNING: TFS does not understand time as part of a query as it runs them in [some thing called "date precision" mode](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/tfsworkitemtracking/thread/2ab986ac-fbf6-4b61-8221-ec336c7bff4a/). This sucks and is not documented well. You will therefore only be able to enter the previous days date and see the data asof the previous day.**_

    But we have a little problem. You can’t add as of to a query in Visual Studio, so we need to edit it manually.

    1.  **Save the new query to disk**
        Open the query in edit mode and select “**File | Save \[query\] As…**”

            [![image](images/image_thumb9-3-3.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image9.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Save the query locally**

    2.  **Open the Query in notepad**
        Right click on the saved query and “**Open with… | Select notepad | Un-tick the Always open | Ok**”

            [![SNAGHTML3295022](images/SNAGHTML3295022_thumb-5-5.png "SNAGHTML3295022")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML3295022.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Open the query in notepad**

    3.  **Edit the query**
        Once you have the query open, find the end and add “asof ‘2/24/2012 11:30:00 AM’”. the end of the query is “” so just add it just before that.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: add the Asof to the end of the query and save**

    4.  **Open the Query in Visual Studio**

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: New Query is a window into the past**
        Note: You will see things in here that are not from the past. It will show visible field data for all work items as they were at that point in time. You may see stuff that was added after that matched the criteria and obviously it cant go back in time as it di not exist. Think of it as an anti-paradox check so you can’t edit a work item before it even existed.
    5.  **Save the query to your My Queries**
        [![SNAGHTML3705745](images/SNAGHTML3705745_thumb-8-8.png "SNAGHTML3705745")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML3705745.png)
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Save the query to your My Queries  
         **
    6.  **Open the query in Excel**
        Open both your new query that shows the old values and the original query that shows the current values in Excel. Make sure that you have the same columns and the same number of rows. If you don’t then you will need to tweak both queries to show the same data.

        **Figure: Excel now shows your old data

    7.  **Order by ID**
        Order both of your Excel sheets by the Work Item ID so that they are in the same order.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: You MUST have the same order and columns**

    8.  **Past “old” over “new” data**
        Copy the “Old” data from the “new” query over the top of the “new” data from the “old” query and then thoroughly check the data to make sure that it is what you expect.

            [![SNAGHTML37ad00c](images/SNAGHTML37ad00c_thumb-11-11.png "SNAGHTML37ad00c")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML37ad00c.png)

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Copy the data you want and past over the data you don't**

    9.  **Check your data**
    10. **Check it again!**
    11. **Make really sure and the Publish back to TFS**
        [![SNAGHTML37d56b9](images/SNAGHTML37d56b9_thumb-12-12.png "SNAGHTML37d56b9")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML37d56b9.png)
        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Overwrite the new data with the old in TFS**

    If all has gone well then you are back to the data that you wanted. However, please remember that we did not fix any hierarchy so if you overwrote that while editing with a “tree query” then you will need to fix that manually.

    ### Solution 3 – How do I make sure that this never happens again

    Well, you can’t… that kind of how databases work. if you bulk edit then really make sure of your changes. However if you want to have a little bit of protection you can save your Excel documents to SharePoint and open and edit them from there. You can enable versioning on the Document library and you would have been able to just open the old version of the Excel sheet and overwrite the data in a couple of minutes.

    1.  **Open your document library settings**
        Once you have it open select “Library | Library Settings” coz we need to enable versioning.

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Enabling is easy  
         **
    2.  **Select the “versioning Settings”**

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Versioning is a fantastic feature  
         **
    3.  **Setup versioning**
        I would suggest to solve this issue we only really need one or two versions back, but you may want more for posterity

            ![SNAGHTML38800ae](images/SNAGHTML38800ae_thumb-15-15.png "SNAGHTML38800ae")

        { .post-img }
        **Figure: Setup versioning to be a little safer**

    If you now save your Excel documents back to SharePoint you will be able to easily get back to older version of your data for whatever reasons you want.

    ### Conclusion

    This is I guess of of the dangers of bulk editing in Excel and I really only use Excel for build editing of work items. As such I don’t get complacent and I always check multiple times before saving back when changing more then one or two fields at a time.

    Oh, and I never use “Tree View”, and I have even more reason not to now.

    I hope this helps my customer and others who might end up in the same situation.

    > \>>Do you think ALM is a useful term?

    Yes, I do think that it is. The old way of looking at an SDLC was just a little too narrow and allowed us as software professionals to ignore what happed after we chuck our software over the wall to our deployment and support teams. ALM brings these ideas and the dependencies together to highlight, and work together, to solve some of the resultant problems. It is unlikely that any team/organisation that look only at an SDLC would ever be able to get to a state of continuous delivery. This is due to them washing their hands of any of these problems well before their software ever gets to production. Delivering software to the next stage gate is not enough any more, we need to be able to deliver to production and adapt our innovatory of features yet to be implemented to reflect stakeholder feedback.

    > \>>There is such a big difference between the way a huge organization would do ALM  and the tools they would use and a small software company doing Agile ALM to try and lump them together doesn't seem helpful to me.

    Apart from scale there should not be a difference in the way that companies deliver software. In order to deliver high quality and production ready software to our customers we need to do and take care of the same things wither we are small (Arnold Clark) or large (Boeing). Even if we are a couple of developers building software for internal use at our company we still need to have quality in our software and do our best to prevent bugs reaching production. If we build poor software that is riddled with technical debt are we not doing our customers (wither internal or external) a disservice at best and perpetrating fraud at worst.

    If I hire a **Professional** Software Developer I expect to get one. That means Source Control, Work Item Tracking automated build and likely automated deployment. I expect well tested software that can be easily maintained and is adaptable to my business needs. I also expect Agile practices as it has been proven time and again that waterfall (serial development) results in poor quality inflexible software and that the only way to build high quality software in the modern world is to use agility.

    Caveat: I am not saying that it is impossible to build high quality software with waterfall, just that in practice it is unlikely.

    Large companies that do not practice agile more often than not suffer from atrophy of software as well as an inability to adapt to the changing world. Most large companies (Microsoft | Boeing | Ford) have already gained an understanding of this and are on the long road to agile.

    In sort... everyone should be building software using agile methods.

    > \>>I have collected some data that suggests interest in ALM in northern Europe is comparable to that in the USA but that interest in Agile ALM is much lower in Northern Europe compared to USA. Does that sound right? Do you have any idea why that might be.

    That does sound right and is one of the reasons that I am working in the US and not in Europe. Don’t get me wrong, Agile is catching on there as well, but the companies tend to have been around for longer with entrenched management that does not often see new blood. With the “old boys club” mentality it will be a generation before we see swaths of change there, but it is starting.

    We are on the crest of the waves of change in Europe and the next 10 years will be interesting in-deed as agile sweeps across it. It will be interesting to see which companies adopt first as they will run rings around their competitors by delivering more value to their customers. I think we will be surprised who end up on top.

    > \>>Forrester talk about [ALM 1.0, ALM 2.0, ALM 2.0+](http://blogs.forrester.com/tom_grant/11-04-18-the_first_question_about_alm_tools_isnt_about_the_tools) and single and multi vendor solutions. How much significance do you think the users place in these kinds of distinctions?

    If you are Infosys, with is number of project under way then this is something to consider, but most don’t even realise these debates exist. Forester reports are not light reading and empty your pockets quickly. The shift is really about maturity of the tools (preceded by maturity of the space) finally showing users that they need to be leading the way rather than the vendors. The reality of ALM 2.0+ is that it will make it easier for all users to get benefit. More will be automatic and initiative and is driven less by what the tools can do but by what you can achieve. Amusingly the tools have driven this understanding and have now tipped the balance over to the customer driving what is required. If you read [Agile Software Engineering with Visual Studio: From Concept to Continuous Feedback](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Visual-Studio-ebook/dp/B005N8EX1G)  you can see that happening with the Visual Studio ALM toolset already and the Visual Studio 11 beta release will be a marked push in that direction. It helps when the vendor becomes also the consumer.

    So while users don't put any onus on these distinctions, the ALM community does.

    Jason Zander has just announced that the Visual Studio 11 & Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server Beta **will be available on the 29th February 2012**. I am really looking forward to this launch as it embodies the phrase “spit & polish” and really lowers the bar for entry into the Team Foundation Server world.

    Unless you have been living under a rock you should also be aware of [http://tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com), the cloud based version of Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server that has been running in beta for a while. As well as the on-premises version of TFS offering Go-Live with Visual Studio 11 Beta, the cloud version has been offering Go-Live for a while now.

    Microsoft themselves use it for many projects including the Visual Studio 11 ALM team themselves so it is kind of like them giving us access to their own dog-fooding server as well. Bu the reality of it is that they are fully supporting it.

    So why should you NOT go to the cloud?

    - **No Legacy Support** - You can’t use Visual Studio 2008 or 2005 to access it.  
       Note: This support is not there yet and no promises have been made as to when, if ever, it will be available.
    - **No Custom Work Item Types** – You can only use the process templates that come out-of-the-box.  
       Note: Again, no news yet on when this might be coming
    - **No Lab Management** – And don’t expect to see this soon, its hard.

    Now that is out of the way – Why should you move to the cloud?

    - **No Server to support** – Microsoft will do all of the management for you
    - **Automatic Team Project Upgrades** – As Microsoft update the product your process template will be upgraded gracefully  
       note: Hence why there are no changes allowed
    - **Awesome UI improvements** – There are no words to describe how fantastic the new UI is. And not just compared to the 2010 version, I think the competition is a little worried.
    - **More to Come** – The cloud team has managed to get its update frequency down for one every 3 months to about once a month so expect to see the features as soon as they are ready.  
       Note: [Jason Zander](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/) has committed (see his [ALM Summit talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/ALM-Summit/2011)) to get this down to one a week!

    And on that note, I just completed my first customer transition to the cloud. I have had a few customers with interest in moving, and most of those are currently playing with it, but it is a big decision. This customer did not yet have Source Control and was still stuck on a file share with work item tracking done of paper!

    So I said “You guys need a cloud solution?” and they said “Yipee! Lets go!”

    - **Rearrange your Source  
       **  
       Importing source into any source control system is hard as you want to be sure of your layout. So we had a couple of session on [how to layout your source code](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/guidance-how-to-layout-you-files-for-an-ideal-solution/) (note: I need to update that) and settled on a model that worked. They studiously went away and mapped some of their projects into that format and imported it into a Trial project in TFS.

      \*\*Figure: Visual Studio 2010 Connected to Team Foundation Service
      \*\*Note: If you have existing code and history you can use the [TFS Integration Platform](http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/) to move all of your Source and Work Items to the cloud.
    - **Adding source control bindings**
      You can easily import whole folders full of source by setting a mapping in TFS and dropping the folders to import under it. Then when you open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 you will first have to Upgrade it then manage the Bindings to source control so that the files know that they should be talking toTFS.

      { .post-img }
      **Figure: manage the bindings to put the Solution under source control**

    - **Figure out Work Items**
      Work Items are a little easier as all the have to do is enter them as they don’t currently have any ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile1-5-5.png). I did an overview of Agile Product Planning the features of the tool to get them started, but it will take time before they are fully up to speed.

      **Figure: New UI provides a low barrier for entry**

    Well, that's it.

    My first customer has moved Source Control & Work Item Tracking to Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation **Service**. Granted it was an easy one, and not all are. But I just wanted to show how easy it can be. The barrier for entry on this one was practically nil and it was an awesome and painless experience for both the customer and me.

    In a couple of weeks I will loop back with that customer to see how they are getting on and to setup Automated Build for them…

    Its that time again where the Visual Studio and team Foundation Server teams are pushing out their next version of their tools, Visual Studio 11. [Steven & Lori Borg](http://nwcadence.com) teamed up to present a video on [why you would want to Go-Live with Visual Studio 11](http://blog.nwcadence.com/go-live-with-visual-studio-11-beta-3/). I used the Go-Live with many companies with the Visual Studio 2010 launch with no problems. Its as safe as a “RTM” product from most other teams.

    **Figure: Why would you go live**

    Not only should you Go-Live, but it is safe to do so as it is fully supported by Microsoft for production use. That said, you will probably still need some help and Northwest Cadence can help.

    We have a proven track record of delivering high value consulting that targets the specific areas of Application Lifecycle management. Still not sure?

    ![](images/image_thumb1.png)It has been noted by a few that there is currently no way to corporately control Live ID's and their use with Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service. These folks are only partially right as there is a work around, which I use myself. I have had a custom Live ID for the last 10 years and for the last few I have used the Live Custom Domain service to provide a little consistency and to make sure that I do not get any… erroneous users entering the fray.
    { .post-img }

    I even have Google Apps setup on the same domain that I use for Live Custom Domain’s…. I just prefer Gmail…. but I digress. The goal here is to be able to manage and maintain all of the Live ID’s on my domain (mycompany.com) so that I can use those Live ID’s to authenticate users.

    [![SNAGHTML95afda0](images/SNAGHTML95afda0_thumb-9-9.png "SNAGHTML95afda0")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML95afda0.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Adding Live ID’s for a custom domain**

    Go ahead and try to sign up for \[youname\]@hinshelwood.com on [http://passport.com](http://passport.com) ! I’ll wait!

    [![SNAGHTML952fd90](images/SNAGHTML952fd90_thumb-6-6.png "SNAGHTML952fd90")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML952fd90.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: No Windows Live ID for you on my domain sir!**

    You will find that you can't and in fact only I as an admin for a domain specifically setup on Live can. You need to wander off to  [http://domains.live.com/](http://domains.live.com/) and log in there with an administrator account.

    [![Image(2)](images/Image2_thumb-1-1.png "Image(2)")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/Image2.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Its mine... all mine!**

    You can even do this in retrospect if you "own" the domain you own all of the accounts created on it, the current owner just does not know it yet. This is not like Google that pushed the pre-created accounts off back onto its original @gmail.com domain, it sooks up all of existing accounts like a vacuum.

    [![SNAGHTML9563f22](images/SNAGHTML9563f22_thumb-7-7.png "SNAGHTML9563f22")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML9563f22.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Start with picking your domain**

    Setting up the custom Live domain is easy and quick. Just click “Add a Domain” and enter a domain name. You still need to prove that you OWN that domain, but that is in essence all of the configuration that you need to provide on the Live side.

    [![Image(3)](images/Image3_thumb-2-2.png "Image(3)")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/Image3.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Proving that you own the domain with a TXT DNS reference**

    Once you have added the records required by Live Custom Domains/Admin Center you can then setup accounts to use with any live enabled services, but specifically Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service!

    [![SNAGHTML950cdba](images/SNAGHTML950cdba_thumb-4-4.png "SNAGHTML950cdba")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML950cdba.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: You only get 500 users to start with, but you can get more for free**

    Once you have you users setup they can then be added to Team Foundation Service and authenticate correctly. There is no reason as well that you can't set this up on mass as there is a reasonable API that would allow you to integrate this with your domain.

    [![SNAGHTML9513340](images/SNAGHTML9513340_thumb-5-5.png "SNAGHTML9513340")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML9513340.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: API integration for LDAP or Active Directory**

    For me it is easy as hinshelwood.com is a family domain and I only have a few accounts to administer. And really there is no administering as once created, they just exists and the user themselves can change passwords and owns the content.

    [![SNAGHTML95a90ab](images/SNAGHTML95a90ab_thumb-8-8.png "SNAGHTML95a90ab")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/SNAGHTML95a90ab.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: My custom Live ID’s added to Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service**

    With only a few clicks you can now add your corporate emails to Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service and give users Live credentials. Is this a good idea… well, not if your users already have a Live ID.

    It is very frustrating to have to log into more than one Live ID as it requires much strife with logging out. But if you have users that don’t have live ID’s or have rudely named or cryptic live ID’s then it can be a solution.

    Simples...

    [![image](images/image_thumb1.png)](http://blog.nwcadence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image1.png)Over on the Northwest Cadence blog we are doing a big push on Visual Studio 11 (dev11) content.  I and my colleagues will be delivering content on Visual Studio 11,  Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server & Visual Studio Team Foundation Service (AKA TFS Preview).
    { .post-img }

    I have been concentrating on the hosted (azure) version of TFS and my first blog post has just gone up on [http://blog.nwcadence.com](http://blog.nwcadence.com) that includes both screenshots, opinions and video demos of TFS preview in action.

    [![image](images/image_thumb3-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image3.png) **Figure: Lots of awesome video demos**
    { .post-img }

    Some of the highlights are:

    - Live ID login
    - Web UI that works on more than IE
    - Dates on Iterations
    - Built in support for Team’s
    - Project & Team profiles with images and identity
    - Default areas and Iterations for teams
    - Support for configuring Alerts for others and teams
    - The ability to see effective permissions
    - Options to see where those effective permissions came from

    I only have one post today, but I have more tomorrow:

    \[feedlist listurl="http://blog.nwcadence.com/author/mrhinsh/feed/rss/" limit=20 more=no\]

    And this just the beginning…

    - **Follow** [**http://blog.nwcadence.com**](http://blog.nwcadence.com) **for more posts…**

    There will be plenty more this month and after the [2012 MVP Global Summit](http://www.2012mvpsummit.com/) in a couple of weeks...

    I posted before about [how you know that you are doing Scrum, or not](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/are-you-doing-scrum-really/), but how do you! This is something that has been banded about both in the Scrum.org community and within Northwest Cadence for a while and we have come to the conclusion that we need to check!

    There are many reasons for a team to not do something they need:

    - We can’t do that here, it would not work
    - We don’t do that coz Scrum “says” not to by omission

    Well, I am proud to announce that we put our heads together and came up with a 6 hour “[Scrum Health Check](http://www.nwcadence.com/HealthCheckScrum.pdf)”.

    [![image](images/image_thumb4-1-1.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image4.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Not in-depth, but an indicator**

    To get the ball rolling we are offering our first 10 Health Checks in March at 40% off. Although 6 hours is not enough to investigate you entire Scrum implementation (we will also do that ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-3-3.png)) it is enough to do a quick check to make sure that:
    { .post-img }

    - You are on the right road!
    - Travelling in the right direction!
    - You are using the right sort of gas!

    We will identify a bunch of “Opportunities” for improvement and highlight where you would be best to spend your effort. If you come back for more we will also check your progress and be able to better predict how close you are to your goals.

    We often speak about the basics of scrum and rarely get into the problems and I wanted a session that represented the “next steps” after deciding that this Scrum thing was a good idea. I will, hopefully, be hitting this session at those that already understand Scrum, but are looking for a little implementation knowledge and guidance before they get stuck in.

    UPDATE: \[[Register for Scrum-damentals on 17th February 2012](https://www.clicktoattend.com/invitation.aspx?code=158652)\]

    UPDATE: \[[Join Scrum-damentals Live at 8:00 am UTC-8](https://meet.lync.com/northwestcadence/master/KL10PKYT) (that's like in less than 10 minutes\]

    UPDATE: I have added both a link to the PDF and the recording below. The sound is a little tinny as the room I was in was a echo box, but hey...you can't have everything.

    \[screencast url="http://www.screencast.com/t/zJYxrnatZ0" width="640" height="360"\] **Webcast: The Scrum-damentals is just beyond the basics**

    As this is an open session it will still be busy (they always are) and there will be only a little room for questions. But I do want to try to spend more time on the complexities so most of my presentation and discussion is on the challenges and strategies of playing the game that is Scrum:

    1. What are the basics?
    2. What are the challenges?
    3. What are the strategies?

    While I will try to cover many aspects of individual problems that are raised, there is usually a myriad of them so feel free to comment below with anything that does not get answered tomorrow.

    > Scrum is the most adopted and recognized agile methodology framework. However, there are still challenges to Scrum adoption. This Event will dive into several Scrum adoption pitfalls and how an organization can avoid them. In particular, we will highlight some of the proven practices that have worked for diverse sets of teams. We will also leave time for questions and encourage attendees to bring your most challenging problems. -[Extract from Scrum-damentals on 17th February 2012](https://www.clicktoattend.com/invitation.aspx?code=158652)

    I recently ran into an odd problem at a customer where the local computer accounts of a computer joined to a domain started showing the SID periodically. For those not in the know, this is BAD.

    WARNING: I did not find a solution to my problem, but this should server as a documentation of what I tried, what did not work, and possible resolutions that were unachievable in the time frame. In fact, all of this could be nothing to do with the problem at all… just saying...

    ### The Problem

    I first notices that even when I added "Domain Users" to a security group in TFS my "Assigned To" list was empty of all users except those specifically added. It looks like when I name a user my local credentials are used and it is successful, but when I add a group it fails.

    **Figure: Holy service accounts, batman**

    So I checked the event log and found an error in the TFS Job Service:

    Lets take a look....

    ### The Investigation

    So I went spelunking and found some interesting things. First was that SQL, running under Network Service was not able to contact the domain properly to query information.

    The Logon Type field indicates the kind of logon that was requested. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

    The Process Information fields indicate which account and process on the system requested the logon.

    The Network Information fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
        - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
        - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
        - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.

    **Figure: This implies that the Machine account does not have permission to AD**

    Now, when you join a computer to a domain it actually gets an account on the domain and a password just like a user. The account is always the computer name appended with a $ which looks like "tfs01$". The password for that account is set every 30 days by request of the client, and there can rarely be any problems.

    [![Hint 4](images/Hint-4_thumb-2-2.png "Hint 4")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/Hint-4.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: Domain Controller error in Event Log**

    But in this case it looks for  it looks as if the machine account has become out of sync, so lets try [resetting the computer account](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216393).

    ```
    C:Userstfs_service>netdom reset "tfs01" /domain:companydomain
    The secure channel from TFS01 to the domain COMPANYDOMAIN has
    been reset.  The connection is with the
    machine DC01.COMPANYDOMAIN.COM.

    The command completed successfully.

    ```

    **Figure: Using netdom to reset the secure channel**

    This should update AD with a new password set by the client, so lets test it out:

    ```
    C:Userstfs_service>Nltest /SC_Verify:companydomain  /SERVER:tfs01
    Flags: b0 HAS_IP  HAS_TIMESERV
    Trusted DC Name dc01.companydomain.com
    Trusted DC Connection Status Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success
    Trust Verification Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success

    The command completed successfully
    ```

    **Figure: Using nltest to check the secure channel**

    After resetting the account I rebooted the server and checked again for the error messages, and dam but they were still there. My next approach was to reset the computer account in Active Directory Users and Computers. After you do this you will need to re-join the computer to the domain as you will get an error on login that states "[The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfssetup/thread/d261abe1-3008-4e8a-bf8a-ef249ee7d341)” for which it it worth investigating. In this case however it is a problem of our own making with the reset, and can be fixed by following:

    1. Join computer to any workgroup
    2. Reboot
    3. Login as local Administrator account
    4. Join computer to domain
    5. Reboot
    6. Login as domain account

    Even this is not you done. When you do a remove, re-join certain services do not like it and you will have to do the following:

    - **Fix Reporting Services** - Re-add the "key" to reporting services through the configuration console as it got confused
    - **Fix SharePoint** - Re-run the SharePoint Configuration without changing anything as it thinks that the machine name has changed

    While this should solve most problems with authentication, it did not solve this one. You may also see a [Event ID 5722 is logged on your domain controller](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810977) which should also be fixed, but is a result of the things that I have tried so far.

    So where next?

    Well, one thing to make sure of is that the [TFS 2010 service account has permission to read from the domain](http://billwg.blogspot.com/2008/12/tfs-service-account-requires-read.html), but it unusual to have this problem as this is the default for accounts in AD. If you have a more locked down configuration it may be something you need to look at.

    One of my colleagues (Rennie) thought that if the Active Directory Domain Services have not been maintained properly (this is a very small company with no real AD skills in-house) then they may have lost one or more of their domain roles. Specifically the PDC Emulation role.

    [![image](images/image_thumb-4-4.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: It looks like the PDC Emulation role is OK**

    This was definitely worth a check, and while it was OK, I did notice something that confused and then shocked me. You now those moments when you find out something that just does not compute, and you just stare at it!

    > This is a Windows 2000 Domain Controller!

    Now that I know that a whole host more potential issues rear their ugly heads.

    So, now to check that Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is installed but who knows which hotfix level if any, and what about bugs that were only fixed in later versions of the OS!

    Pha! (throws up hands in disgust)  Is Windows 2000 domains even supported in TFS?

    > Team Foundation Server is supported in the following Active Directory modes and functional levels:
    >
    > - Windows 2000 Active Directory in native mode.
    > - Windows Server 2003 Active Directory in Windows 2000 native mode.
    > - Windows Server 2003 Active Directory in Windows Server 2003 functional level.
    > - Windows Server 2003 R2 in Windows Server 2003 R2 Active Directory forest functional level.
    >
    > \-[Trusts and Forests Considerations for Team Foundation Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms253081.aspx), MSDN

    What do you know, it is supported (somewhat)

    Windows 2000 domains are only supported in Native mode and will not work in mixed mode (does anyone still have Windows NT4 in prodution?) so lets take a look.

    [![Hint 2](images/Hint-2_thumb-1-1.png "Hint 2")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/Hint-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    **Figure: Will I am a monkeys uncle, it is!**

    While this may be true, I still hold some reservation for the notion that a Domain upgrade may be necessary! To be honest, if it is a miss configuration of the domain somewhere in the mists of time, then a domain replacement may be a better option and creating a brand new "Windows 2008 R2 Domain" would have at least he benefit of modern defaults.

    While on the Domain Controller I also noticed Event ID 1789 in the event log that got me looking into another article on [Error 1789 when you use the LookupAccountName function on a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 R2](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=976494) that while technically is included in the last service pack was not working of me. I could not even apply the Hotfix as it game me the "this update is not valid for your computer" message that is no help. There are manual steps for [Local Groups not resolving domain group name](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsserver2008r2general/thread/846afed4-f3cc-47df-abd0-d111b7d3476a) which stopped that error from being listed, which is one more step closer to a stable working system.

    [![Hint 6](images/Hint-6_thumb-3-3.png "Hint 6")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/Hint-6.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: These manual steps are needed on old domains**

    After all of those steps and spelunking I only have one error message left. The one that started it all… the TF200035… and I can’t seam to get it to talk to Active Directory.

    One thing you may want to try is using TfsSecurity.exe to check wither the accounts are in sync. This can be done easily and there are two things I want to check. First the TFS_Service account:

    ```

    Dag-namit, but I was hoping for some sort of help here! Everything looks just fine except for not being able ot query AD. This is looking more and more like a… “someone ticked a box 7 years ago in AD and no one remembers where or why problem”.

    For those that have encountered them before, there are almost impossible to debug. This is why small companies tend to use the out-of-the-box config and bug companies buy auditing software.

    The very last thing that I can check is that the accounts that have been added to TFS are in deed syncing, even if the groups are not:

    [![image](images/image_thumb1-5-5.png "image")](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image1.png)  
    { .post-img }
    **Figure: making sure the identities in TFS are up to date**

    Well, that was my last option and I have no further insights. I am sure that I will need to return to this in the future, but for now I have implemented a workaround for the customer. they can use the system, but without AD groups.

    While this sucks…sometimes an internal network configuration beats you…. Humph….

    ### The Work Around

    As I have no real solution for this problem that I chased around I have to come up with a workaround that will provide the customer with at least the ability to use TFS. So I created the following local groups at the Server level:

    - Company Developers
    - Company Management
    - Company Project Managers
    - Company Project Admins

    I added them with permission onto the individual team projects and added user accounts directly into these TFS Groups. This lets us secure some work item types, states and have users listed in the drop downs.

    Symptom treated....

    Solving the problem looks to be something that the customer is unwilling ot pay me to do, but I left them with some advice:

    - Try an upgrade to Windows Sever 2008 R2 domain controllers
    - If the problem still exists then create a new Windows Server 2008 R2 domain and move everyone accross

    In saying that this may not even be the problem!

    The Process Template governs nearly all aspects of how the team interacts with Visual Studio and TFS (e.g., the structure and flow of work items). Whether a team has a well-established development process or needs to define one, proper template selection and practice are critical.

    Reports and dashboards (targeted to the selected team process) provide essential transparency and empower teams to identify and address opportunities for continuous process improvement.

    Branching Merging and Build are two parts of the overall software development cycle. In the Branching and Merging session, we cover industries standard approaches to branching and merging, the pros and Cons of the standard approaches, and how each strategy might fit your company needs. In the Build section we cover how to setup a build to help teams deliver quality software. We also cover how the build and branching & merging (or Code Lines) are all integrated within Visual Studio 2010. We also cover the new features and tools that Visual Studio has to offer.

    WARNING: This video stops at 21 minutes :( There was a problem with the encoding of the original and I can't fix it. You can however get this session live below.

    Intellitrace was built in response to the #1 and #2 demands from TFS 2008 customers: help us find bugs faster so we can fix them faster. As a configurable "flight data recorder" for all aspects of debug and test, it provides advanced and integrated logging so devs can locate and reproduce the bug exactly the way it occurred. Especially in Agile environments, regression testing needs can quickly spiral beyond available resources. Automated testing helps, but a large automated test suite can also impede rapid iterative development. Test Impact Analysis helps the team focus and prioritize by automatically identifying which tests are potentially affected by a pending change.

    Over the last year I have delivered a variety of high-level overviews of Visual Studio ALM and the features that are available within it. These are all high level overviews even when talking about specific topics, and I have occasionally had to hand wave where things did not go well (Cough… Sharepoint Dev… cough) but these sessions make up the core features of Visual Studio 2010 and Team Foundation Server 2010.

    As we are getting closer to a better understanding of Dev11 and with an overriding need to clean up my hard drive I wanted to post one of each of the public webcast that I delivered. This does not always represent the best session, but the ones with the least technical hickups along the way ![Smile](images/wlEmoticon-smile-3-3.png)

    ### Bonus webcasts

    While not part of the original series of webcast there was need for a 2 hours session that showed customers, still at a hight level, how their users would interact with the tools on a daily basis.

It shows planning, coding (not TDD) to fix a bug and a testers verification of that bug.

    Its hard for developers to work with testers and its hard for testers to work with developers. There are many tools out there to help teams break down those barriers between them and I really like both the features and workflow of Microsoft Test Manager (MTM). While I am not a tester, I am a developer and the rich bugs that are produced by MTM help me reproduce that evasive bug and improves my relationship with what should be my teammates.

    **Figure: An all too common scenario!**

    > “Every tester should have the heart of a developer…  
    >                …in a jar on their desk!”

    So, what do you need for a well rounded experience with the Visual Studio test tools?

    If you just want an overview of the tool I have a bunch of [Visual Studio 2010 Overview Webcasts](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/an-index-to-all-visual-studio-2010-overview-sessions/) that can help, however to get a real feel for the tools you need to get your hands dirty and for that we have the [Testing with Test Professional 2010 and Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2754206907) hands on lab that we can do both remote and onsite. The current instance is delivered remotely over 3 half days.

    This course is designed to give folks the knowledge necessary to not only use the tools and understand the features, but also to implement those features in the real world. With the rich data reporting capabilities of TFS absorbing all facets of data produced as part of the test cycles, there are many things that will put a smile on with a tester and a test managers face.

    But what if you already have that knowledge (you have taken our course) and you want to add those agile practices that can make a good team great and a successful company… well… very successful…

    Adding those agile practices is easy with [Professional Scrum Developer](http://nwcadence.com/PSDTraining) training that we offer. As well as being one of the most respected agile developer courses around it is the ONLY [official user training for Visual Studio ALM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ff433643). This course brings all of you Team Members together and starts them down the road of working together in an attempt to jump start their adoption. Don’t think that this is just for Scrum teams either as Scrum is really just a tool that helps you adopt agile practices, and while popular (80%+), you can use these taught practices with any agile method.

    I get a lot of questions about the role of the Project Manger in the world of Scrum and there is usually a lot of hemming and hawing from consultants and Scrum coaches that want to take the touchy-feely approach.

    > Update - 2012\- 01 - 21 - I felt that [Are Project Managers Living A Lie?](http://agilescout.com/are-project-managers-living-a-lie/) requires a read as it adds value to this post. I am only advocating a return to the old ways...

    There is NO role for the traditional Project Manager in the world of Scrum!

    There I said it, and really if you want to embody transparency and trust you have to say these things and make them explicitly clear. If you are currently a Project Manager you have two choices:

    1. **Product Owner** - If you are more product or customer focused then it makes a lot of sense for you to head towards the Product Owner role where you can concentrate on the delivery of value to the customers.
    2. **Scrum Master** - If you are more process focused then you can gravitate towards the Scrum Master role and becoming an agent for change within your organisation.

    But what if you are in the third category of Project Manager that is only interested in people management and task up tracking? Well, it is time for that old dog to either learn a new trick or be put down.

    Sorry....

    > Truth 1: People work better when they manage themselves

    For those in #1 and #2, or that are interested in moving there, there are a host of opportunities in these two worlds that will keep you busy and expand your horizons for many years to come. Both of these roles are HARD and owning them and making them work is part of the fun.

    ### Product Owner (PO) or Product Owner Office (POO)

    This business of owning the WHAT is fairly complicated and extensive. There are many jobs that need done in a POO (don't forget to flush) that go beyond the basic PO roll of a single backlog or product. If you are a large organisation then you will likely have many Scrum Teams, many Backlogs and many Products that all need managed. You will have many Stakeholders and competing ideas that need to be validated, valued, filed and ordered in a way that makes the PBI's visible and understood by everyone that looks at it.

    In this case you can and may indeed have folks who have the title of Project Manager and that works for the business and provides services to the Product Owner.

    Note: Make sure that you only have ONE Product Owner per backlog that has complete authority. Although it is alright for them to have help. Note: No, you can't change the Scrum Guide

    This is really hard!

    ### Scrum Master (SM) or Scrum Master Office (SMO)

    The Scrum Master has a hard job as well. They are the torch bearer within their organisation for the process that includes, but is not limited to, Scrum and they have to be that agent for change. I can't tell you how to do that as it is different in every organisation; if anyone tells you otherwise they are lying.

    ### Conclusion

    While this may well turn out be like the posts of 5 years ago about the "death of the Tester" only to have it return I do think that will not be the case here. I believe that we are not getting rid of the Project Manager we are just moving that role back to the Business / Customer side of the story where it belongs.
