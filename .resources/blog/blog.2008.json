His recent post on “[Does test-driven development speed up development?](http://blog.scottbellware.com/2008/12/does-test-driven-development-speed-up.html)” really gets to the crux of an endemic problem in the Software Development industry, especially in companies for whom Software Development is not their core business.\n\n[![](images/Doestestdrivendevelopmentspeedupdevelopm_CF47-iStock_000006327761XSmall_thumb-1-1.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Doestestdrivendevelopmentspeedupdevelopm_CF47-iStock_000006327761XSmall_2.jpg)\n{ .post-img }\n\n> Test-driven development decreases complexity, improves the incremental adaptability that software product development depends on, astronomically reduces the amount of rework that destabilizes schedules, and reduces the unrecognized design flaws that decrease productivity after the initial implementation phase.\n>\n> …\n>\n> Test-driven development supports flow. The software development industry at large is years away from recognizing that flow rather than efficiency is what creates giant leaps in productivity. Nonetheless, it works, and it's supported by the production physics used by industries that are well ahead of software development in product development and production maturity and optimization.\n>\n> …\n>\n> [Scott Bellware](http://blog.scottbellware.com/) on [Does test-driven development speed up development?](http://blog.scottbellware.com/2008/12/does-test-driven-development-speed-up.html)\n\nThis is a must read for any Software Professional… unless you are already using TDD :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Software Development](http://technorati.com/tags/Software+Development)\n",

You will no longer need to add individual alerts to users.\n\nIt is developed in .NET 3.5 SP1 for Team Foundation Server 2008 and is deployed as a system service.\n\n**I have added support for groups. If you add a TFS group into the Assigned To drop down all members of that group will receive notifications!**\n\nYou will need to allow groups in your Assigned to list. Below is a snippet from me Bug work item type as it stands at the moment.\n\n```\n   1: <FIELD reportable=\"dimension\" type=\"String\" name=\"Assigned To\" refname=\"System.AssignedTo\">\n```\n\n```\n   2:     <HELPTEXT>The person assigned to act on the bug, either to fix it or to verify the fix</HELPTEXT>\n```\n\n```\n   3:     <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />\n```\n\n```\n   4:     <ALLOWEDVALUES filteritems=\"excludegroups\">\n```\n\n```\n   5:         <LISTITEM value=\"[project]Contributors\" />\n```\n\n```\n   6:     </ALLOWEDVALUES>\n```\n\n```\n   7: </FIELD>\n```\n\nYou can see on line 4 that there is a filter for excluding the groups from the list. If you are using [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) v1.0 or v1.1 then you will need this line. If you install the new [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) v1.3 then you will be able to remove that and start assigning work items to Groups.\n\n**Note: Although they will now get an email, the work item will not appear in their “My Work items” query. You may want to consider creating a Query for each Group.**\n\nThe Alerts that you no longer need users to individually setup are:\n\n- A work item is assigned to you, or a group you are a member of.\n\n- A work item that is assigned to you, or a group you are a member of is, reassigned to someone else.\n\n- A work item that you created is assigned to someone else, or a group.\n\nThere is also a framework for [creating and deploying your own event handlers](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Wiki/View.aspx?title=TFS%20Event%20Handlers%20v1.0&referringTitle=Home) that can do pretty much whatever you want. One of the shipped examples updates “Heat ITSM” whenever a work item that contains a Heat Id is changed.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

    "BodyContent": "This is a lot harder than it sounds. At first you think there will be a built in option with the [Read Identities](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.igroupsecurityservice.readidentities.aspx) method on the [IGroupSecurityService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.igroupsecurityservice.aspx) Interface, but you would be wrong!\n\nWhen capturing an event from Team Foundation Server you have access to a lot of information about the change, including the Display Name of the fields for Assigned To and Changed By.\n\nBut what if you allow Work Items to be assigned to groups! First, lets achieve that. Create a group called “Program Management” on a project and add it into the “Contributors” list. We have a group for each of the advocacy groups in the CMMI process.\n\nEdit your “Task” work item definition (you can use the power tools process editor or just edit the XML) and alter the Assigned To field to be the following:\n\n```\n   1: <FIELD reportable=\"dimension\" type=\"String\" name=\"Assigned To\" rename=\"System.AssignedTo\">\n```\n\n```\n   2:   <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />\n```\n\n```\n   3:   <ALLOWEDVALUES>\n```\n\n```\n   4:     <LISTITEM value=\"[project]Contributors\" />\n```\n\n```\n   5:   </ALLOWEDVALUES>\n```\n\n```\n   6: </FIELD>\n```\n\nOnce you have updated your project you should be able to see all of the users as well as this new group displayed. If you were to assign a task to this group, how would you email everyone in that group so that they know they have been assigned something at all?\n\nWell this needs a wee tweak of the [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler)  to handle this, I will be releasing the full in place code with the TFS Event Handler v1.3 drop, but you can download my little test app I used to get it all working.\n\n\\[[Download Project](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/CodeDrop/TFS%20Identity%20Retreval%20Test.rar \"Download TFS Identity Retreval Test Source\")\\]\n\nYou can enter a display name of either a user or a group. And here is how it is done:\n\nThere is a little but of Active Directory lookup using a little method called GetUsername\n\n```\n   1: '' <summary>\n```\n\n```\n   2: '' Retrieves a user's email address from Active Directory based on their display name\n```\n\n```\n   3: '' </summary>\n```\n\n```\n   4: Public Shared Function GetUsername(ByVal userDisplayName As String) As String\n```\n\n```\n   5:     Dim ds As DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher = New DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher()\n```\n\n```\n   6:     ds.PropertiesToLoad.Add(\"sAMAccountName\")\n```\n\n```\n   7:     ds.Filter = String.Format(\"(&(displayName={0})(objectCategory=person)((objectClass=user)))\", userDisplayName)\n```\n\n```\n   8: \n```\n\n```\n   9:     Dim results As DirectoryServices.SearchResultCollection = ds.FindAll()\n```\n\n```\n  10:     If results.Count = 0 Then\n```\n\n```\n  11:         Return String.Empty\n```\n\n```\n  12:     End If\n```\n\n```\n  13:     Dim values As DirectoryServices.ResultPropertyValueCollection = results(0).Properties(\"sAMAccountName\")\n```\n\n```\n  14:     If values.Count = 0 Then\n```\n\n```\n  15:         Return String.Empty\n```\n\n```\n  16:     End If\n```\n\n```\n  17:     Return values(0).ToString()\n```\n\n```\n  18: End Function\n```\n\nThis retrieves the users sAMAccountName (or username) from Active Directory. Easy enough, and I already had it kicking about…\n\nBut in order to retrieve an identity that you are not sure is a group or a user, you will need to try to get the Group Identity first. This is because it is faster to wade through a maximum of 20 groups than potentially hundreds of users [mentioned on the MSDN Forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsworkitemtracking/thread/413bd663-707b-41af-83c7-c92015b0f80f/) answer below.\n\n```\n   1: Try\n```\n\n```\n   2:            '----------------------------------------\n```\n\n```\n   3:            Dim svr As New TeamFoundationServer(Me.uxTeamServer.Text)\n```\n\n```\n   4:            Dim GroupSecurityService As IGroupSecurityService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(IGroupSecurityService)), IGroupSecurityService)\n```\n\n```\n   5:            '----------------------------------------\n```\n\n```\n   6:            Dim CommonStructureService As ICommonStructureService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(ICommonStructureService)), ICommonStructureService)\n```\n\n```\n   7:            '----------------------------------------\n```\n\n```\n   8:            ' Return App Group if you can\n```\n\n```\n   9:            Dim pi As ProjectInfo = m_CommonStructureService.GetProjectFromName(Me.uxProject.Text)\n```\n\n```\n  10:            Dim appGroup As Identity = (From i In m_GroupSecurityService.ListApplicationGroups(pi.Uri) Where i.DisplayName = Me.uxDisplayName.Text).SingleOrDefault\n```\n\n```\n  11:            If Not appGroup Is Nothing Then\n```\n\n```\n  12:                appGroup = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.Sid, appGroup.Sid, QueryMembership.Expanded)\n```\n\n```\n  13:                WriteToLog(String.Format(\"Recieved identity for {0}\", Me.uxDisplayName.Text))\n```\n\n```\n  14:                WriteIdentity(appGroup)\n```\n\n```\n  15:                Exit Try\n```\n\n```\n  16:            End If\n```\n\n```\n  17:            ' Not app group.

You could use the [WorkItemStore](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitemstore.aspx) instead of the [ICommonStructureService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.icommonstructureservice.aspx), but the [WorkItemStore](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitemstore.aspx) has a heavy performance hit for retrieving an instance.\n\n```\n   1: Dim svr As New TeamFoundationServer(Me.uxTeamServer.Text)\n```\n\n```\n   2: Dim GroupSecurityService As IGroupSecurityService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(IGroupSecurityService)), IGroupSecurityService)\n```\n\n```\n   3: Dim CommonStructureService As ICommonStructureService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(ICommonStructureService)), ICommonStructureService)\n```\n\nNext we need to try and retrieve the Identity of the group, if it is one.  The ICommonStructureService  has a method for listing all of the Groups available within a project, but for that you need the project name which in the demo is just entered.\n\n```\n   1: ' Return App Group if you can\n```\n\n```\n   2: Dim pi As ProjectInfo = m_CommonStructureService.GetProjectFromName(Me.uxProject.Text)\n```\n\n```\n   3: Dim appGroup As Identity = (From i In m_GroupSecurityService.ListApplicationGroups(pi.Uri) Where i.DisplayName = Me.uxDisplayName.Text).SingleOrDefault\n```\n\n```\n   4: If Not appGroup Is Nothing Then\n```\n\n```\n   5:   appGroup = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.Sid, appGroup.Sid, QueryMembership.Expanded)\n```\n\n```\n   6:   WriteToLog(String.Format(\"Recieved identity for {0}\", Me.uxDisplayName.Text))\n```\n\n```\n   7:   WriteIdentity(appGroup)\n```\n\n```\n   8:   Exit Try\n```\n\n```\n   9: End If\n```\n\nWhat this does is use the project name entered (in the event it is under the element ProtfolioProject (yea, I don’t know why it is called that either) to search a list of Group’s within your project for the one of interest.\n\nThen, as it does not by default load the “Members” and “MemberOf” arrays you need to call ReadIdentity with the Expand option is you want to list the Members, and I do.\n\n[![image](images/RetrievinganidentityfromTeamFoundationSe_E782-image_thumb-2-2.png)](images/RetrievinganidentityfromTeamFoundationSe_E782-image_thumb-2-2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf this does not return an identity, then we need to look at the display name being a user account.\n\n```\n   1: ' Not app group. Then return user is you can\n```\n\n```\n   2: Dim username As String = GetUsername(Me.uxDisplayName.Text)\n```\n\n```\n   3: Dim usrIdent As Identity =

Things to watch out for are:\n\n- Remove all previous versions before the install. This included any CTP or RC versions.\n- You will NOT be able to upgrade your projects built with the CTP releases! You should however be able to upgrade any projects built with the RC.\n\n> ### Installation\n>\n> #### Uninstall old GDR versions\n>\n> If you have a previous version of the GDR installed, you will have to uninstall these first.

    "BodyContent": "What a mouthful! Has there ever been any products with names as long as the Team System toolset ;), Maybe thats why it is just called [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en).\n\nAnyway, congratulations to the [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) team for this wonderful piece of work. I have been following the GDR for a while and I have been very impressed with the capabilities on offer.\n\nAlthough this is billed as a new release of [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en), it is really a completely new product with a brand new architecture. They have made many improvements to scalability, and they have added many extensibility  points (Microsoft speak for places where you can inject your own functionality).\n\n### Model based architecture\n\nEverything underneath the covers is based on a true model representation of the SQL Server schema. This facilitates a true offline declarative database development system where the source code defines the shapes of the schema objects.\n\n### **Database Schema Providers**\n\nModels are implemented by **Database Schema Providers**, DSP's for short. - The introduction of a provider model enables multiple things at once. First of all the decoupling of release vehicles. For example when SQL Server will release a new version or adds new functionality in a service pack, like they did in SQL Server 2005 SP2 when adding \"vardecimal\" support, we can simply update an existing provider or provide a new one in case of a new SQL Server release. Overtime we will go to a model where the SQL Server providers will be an integral part of the SQL Server release. The provider model is also a key extensibility point, allowing 3rd parties to extend database project ecosystem and add support for other database platforms in Visual Studio Team System 2010.\n\n### Tool extensibility\n\nIn this release external tool writers have full access to the T-SQL parsers (for SQL Server 2000, 2005 and 2008), the SQL Script DOM and the schema model (when inside Visual Studio). This adds on top of the ability to write extend the tools inside the platform. You can extend T-SQL refactoring by writing your own refactoring types (operations) and refactoring targets; add T-SQL Static Code Analysis rules, data generators, data distributions and test conditions. Database Projects (.dbproj) now provide a truly extensible declarative database development platform.\n\n### Separation of BUILD and DEPLOY\n\nThe separation of build & deploy makes it possible to deploy the output of your database project to many different targets and different points in time. Build now produces a single artifact file hat describes the schema inside your database, called a .DBSCHEMA file. This file is used by the deployment engine to deploy your schema.\n\n### **Standalone Deployment Engine**.\n\nThe inclusion of a standalone and [redistributable](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/22/redist.aspx) deployment engine makes it possible to deploy the output of your database projects (.DBSCHEMA files) to a target database without the need of having Visual Studio Team System Database Edition installed. This enables key scenarios like the inclusion of database schema deployment as part of your application installation.\n\nGet it now :)\n\n> **Download page**  \n> [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en)  \n> **Setup**  \n> [http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/setup.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/setup.exe)\n>\n> - **Read Me**  \n>    [http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/Readme.mht](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/Readme.mht)\n> - **Documentation:**  \n>    [http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/Documentation.zip](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/e/0ae1153a-8798-474a-93e6-d19299f37c8b/Documentation.zip)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

My mission, that I stupidly accepted, was to update the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) application with their [XamRibbon](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamRibbon.aspx) and [XamDockManager](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamdockmanager.aspx) controls, and anything else I can stuff in there.\n\n![](images/pnp.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe “anything else” I decided to use was the [Composite WPF](http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF) guidance.

I seam to have licked the [XamRibbon](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamRibbon.aspx) implementation, but I am still working on the [XamDockManager](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamdockmanager.aspx) bits.\n\nNote: You will need to be familiar with the Composite WPF bits for this all to make sense.\n\n```\n   1: <igRibbon:XamRibbon  x:Name=\"uxXamRibbon\" cal:RegionManager.RegionName=\"{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_Ribbon}\"\n\n                           AllowMinimize=\"True\" AutoHideEnabled=\"False\" IsMinimized=\"False\">\n```\n\n```\n   2:         <igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n   3:           <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu cal:RegionManager.RegionName=\"{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_RibbonApplicationMenu}\"\n\n                                           Image=\"/Hinshelwood.TFSStickyBuddy;component/RDIcon.ico\">\n```\n\n```\n   4:             <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n   5:               <igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar cal:RegionManager.RegionName=\"{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_RibbonApplicationMenuFooterToolbar}\">\n```\n\n```\n   6:               </igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n   7:            </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n   8:         </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n   9:      </igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n  10: </igRibbon:XamRibbon>\n```\n\nAs you can see there are a number of regions here, for the Tabs, the Application Menu and the FooterToolbar. You will need both a XamRibbon and a RibbonTabItem adapter.\n\n```\n   1: Public Class RibbonRegionAdapter\n```\n\n```\n   2:     Inherits RegionAdapterBase(Of XamRibbon)\n```\n\n```\n   3:\n```\n\n```\n   4:     Private m_regionTarget As XamRibbon\n```\n\n```\n   5:\n```\n\n```\n   6:     Protected Overrides Sub Adapt(ByVal region As Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Regions.IRegion, ByVal regionTarget As XamRibbon)\n```\n\n```\n   7:         m_regionTarget = regionTarget\n```\n\n```\n   8:         regionTarget.Tabs.Clear()\n```\n\n```\n   9:         AddHandler region.ActiveViews.CollectionChanged, AddressOf OnActiveViewsChanged\n```\n\n```\n  10:         For Each v As RibbonTabItem In region.ActiveViews\n```\n\n```\n  11:             regionTarget.Tabs.Add(v)\n```\n\n```\n  12:         Next\n```\n\n```\n  13:\n```\n\n```\n  14:     End Sub\n```\n\n```\n  15:\n```\n\n```\n  16:     Private Sub OnActiveViewsChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs)\n```\n\n```\n  17:         Select Case e.Action\n```\n\n```\n  18:             Case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add\n```\n\n```\n  19:                 For Each v In e.NewItems\n```\n\n```\n  20:                     m_regionTarget.Tabs.Add(v)\n```\n\n```\n  21:                 Next\n```\n\n```\n  22:             Case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove\n```\n\n```\n  23:                 For Each v In e.OldItems\n```\n\n```\n  24:                     m_regionTarget.Tabs.Remove(v)\n```\n\n```\n  25:                 Next\n```\n\n```\n  26:         End Select\n```\n\n```\n  27:     End Sub\n```\n\n```\n  28:\n```\n\n```\n  29:     Protected Overrides Function CreateRegion() As Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Regions.IRegion\n```\n\n```\n  30:         Return New AllActiveRegion\n```\n\n```\n  31:     End Function\n```\n\n```\n  32:\n```\n\n```\n  33: End Class\n```\n\n```\n   1: Public Class RibbonTabItemRegionAdapter\n```\n\n```\n   2:     Inherits RegionAdapterBase(Of RibbonTabItem)\n```\n\n```\n   3:\n```\n\n```\n   4:     Private m_regionTarget As RibbonTabItem\n```\n\n```\n   5:\n```\n\n```\n   6:     Protected Overrides Sub Adapt(ByVal region As Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Regions.IRegion, ByVal regionTarget As RibbonTabItem)\n```\n\n```\n   7:         m_regionTarget = regionTarget\n```\n\n```\n   8:         regionTarget.Content.Clear()\n```\n\n```\n   9:         AddHandler region.ActiveViews.CollectionChanged, AddressOf OnActiveViewsChanged\n```\n\n```\n  10:         For Each v As Object In region.ActiveViews\n```\n\n```\n  11:             regionTarget.Content.Add(v)\n```\n\n```\n  12:         Next\n```\n\n```\n  13:\n```\n\n```\n  14:     End Sub\n```\n\n```\n  15:\n```\n\n```\n  16:     Private Sub OnActiveViewsChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs)\n```\n\n```\n  17:         Select Case e.Action\n```\n\n```\n  18:             Case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add\n```\n\n```\n  19:                 For Each v In e.NewItems\n```\n\n```\n  20:                     m_regionTarget.Content.Add(v)\n```\n\n```\n  21:                 Next\n```\n\n```\n  22:             Case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove\n```\n\n```\n  23:                 For Each v In e.OldItems\n```\n\n```\n  24:                     m_regionTarget.Content.Remove(v)\n```\n\n```\n  25:                 Next\n```\n\n```\n  26:         End Select\n```\n\n```\n  27:     End Sub\n```\n\n```\n  28:\n```\n\n```\n  29:     Protected Overrides Function CreateRegion() As Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Regions.IRegion\n```\n\n```\n  30:         Return New AllActiveRegion\n```\n\n```\n  31:     End Function\n```\n\n```\n  32:\n```\n\n```\n  33: End Class\n```\n\nI am pretty sure that these can be augmented, and I can think of a few Ideas already, including adding a re-parenting ability to allow menu items to be added to the XAML as well as programmatically added.\n\nI think I might have to go away and try this…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject)\n",

    "BodyContent": "If, like me, you like to have changeable resource files in your application. Wither it is for changing the Theme, or interchanging templates you will need to take special care when using the\n\n[](http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF)libraries.\n\nThe new version of the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) uses both!\n\n[![image](images/CompositeWPFandMergedDictionaries_9AD7-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CompositeWPFandMergedDictionaries_9AD7-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI am using the built in Infragistics theme system, and the first time you select a theme I am just adding a resource file that overrides the default:\n\n```\n   1: Dim resourceDictionary As ResourceDictionary = ThemeManager.GetResourceSet(theme, ThemeManager.AllGroupingsLiteral)\n```\n\n```\n   2: If Not resourceDictionary Is Nothing Then\n```\n\n```\n   3:    Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(resourceDictionary)\n```\n\n```\n   4: End If\n```\n\nThis causes an error in the ItemsControlRegionAdapter as WPF seams to redo the region adapters and you get a ItemsControlHasItemsSourceException. You need to change the code to the following (notice the commented out areas):\n\n```\n   1: /// <summary>\n```\n\n```\n   2: /// Adapts an <see cref=\"ItemsControl\"/> to an <see cref=\"IRegion\"/>.\n```\n\n```\n   3: /// </summary>\n```\n\n```\n   4: /// <param name=\"region\">The new region being used.</param>\n```\n\n```\n   5: /// <param name=\"regionTarget\">The object to adapt.</param>\n```\n\n```\n   6: protected override void Adapt(IRegion region, ItemsControl regionTarget)\n```\n\n```\n   7: {  //Modified by Martin Hinshelwood to allow resource file changes...\n```\n\n```\n   8:     //if (regionTarget.ItemsSource != null || (BindingOperations.GetBinding(regionTarget, ItemsControl.ItemsSourceProperty) != null))\n```\n\n```\n   9:     //    throw new InvalidOperationException(Resources.ItemsControlHasItemsSourceException);\n```\n\n```\n  10:\n```\n\n```\n  11:     //If control has child items, move them to the region and then bind control to region. Can't set ItemsSource if child items exist.\n```\n\n```\n  12:     if (regionTarget.Items.Count > 0)\n```\n\n```\n  13:     {\n```\n\n```\n  14:         foreach (object childItem in regionTarget.Items)\n```\n\n```\n  15:         {\n```\n\n```\n  16:             region.Add(childItem);\n```\n\n```\n  17:         }\n```\n\n```\n  18:         //Control must be empty before setting ItemsSource\n```\n\n```\n  19:         regionTarget.ItemsSource = null;\n```\n\n```\n  20:         //regionTarget.Items.Clear();\n```\n\n```\n  21:     }\n```\n\n```\n  22:     regionTarget.ItemsSource = region.Views;\n```\n\n```\n  23: }\n```\n\nYou will notice that I had to comment out the exception for existing controls as well as the Items.Clear (which is replaced by setting the ItemsSource to nothing). This solves the problem I I have not noticed any adverse reactions.\n\nThe second problem occurs when you do you second set of the theme. at this point you need to remove the existing theme:\n\n```\n   1: If Not m_CurrentTheme Is Nothing Then\n```\n\n```\n   2:       Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Remove(m_CurrentTheme)\n```\n\n```\n   3: End If\n```\n\nWhen this happens the region management is redone and you get a further RegionNameExistsException from the RegionManager. Then can be solved by changing the code in the AttachNewRegion method:\n\n```\n   1: /// <summary>\n```\n\n```\n   2: /// Attaches a region to an object and adds it to the region manager.\n```\n\n```\n   3: /// </summary>\n```\n\n```\n   4: /// <param name=\"regionTarget\">The object to adapt. This is typically a container (i.e a control).</param>\n```\n\n```\n   5: /// <param name=\"regionName\">The name of the region to register.</param>\n```\n\n```\n   6: /// <exception cref=\"ArgumentException\">When regions collection already has a region registered using <paramref name=\"regionName\"/>.</exception>\n```\n\n```\n   7: public void AttachNewRegion(object regionTarget, string regionName)\n```\n\n```\n   8: {  //Modified by Martin Hinshelwood to allow resource file changes...\n```\n\n```\n   9:     if (Regions.ContainsKey(regionName))\n```\n\n```\n  10:         return; //throw new ArgumentException(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Resources.RegionNameExistsException, regionName));\n```\n\n```\n  11:\n```\n\n```\n  12:     IRegionAdapter regionAdapter = regionAdapterMappings.GetMapping(regionTarget.GetType());\n```\n\n```\n  13:     IRegion region = regionAdapter.Initialize(regionTarget);\n```\n\n```\n  14:\n```\n\n```\n  15:     Regions.Add(regionName, region);\n```\n\n```\n  16: }\n```\n\nSo instead of bombing out when you try to add a region of the same name, it will just ignore it. Not ideal, but necessary.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT)\n",

    "BodyContent": "![](images/logo-1-1.gif) \n{ .post-img }\n\nI am currently getting to grips with the Infragistics WPF controls that they call [NetAdvantage for WPF](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf.aspx). So far I have found them easy to use, but the documentation of examples is very lax. Do not mistake me, these components are fantastic and do way more work for me than I would care to do myself, but if you Google a particular piece of their API invariable you will get pure documentation and no samples. If you are lucky someone has asked a specific question about it and you can skim their answers, but the likely hood of finding an answer to your question is negligible in my experience.\n\nI still love the components, it just makes it a little more difficult to develop with them…\n\nAn example would maybe get us all on the same page:\n\nI am using their Ribbon components in one of my applications and wanted to dynamically generate (using a binding) the menu options.\n\n```\n   1: <igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n   2: \n```\n\n```\n   3:             <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n   4:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name=\"uxTeamServerMenuTool\" Caption=\"Team Server\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding AvailableServers}\"                                           ItemTemplate=\"{DynamicResource tAvailableServers}\" ButtonType=\"DropDown\"                                           LargeImage=\"ResourcesImagesTeamServerSelectIcon.png\">\n```\n\n```\n   5:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>\n```\n\n```\n   6:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name=\"uxTeamProjectMenuTool\" Caption=\"Team Project\" ItemsSource=\"{Binding AvailableProjects}\"                                             ButtonType=\"DropDown\" SmallImage=\"ResourcesImagesTeamProjectSelectIcon.png\">\n```\n\n```\n   7:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>\n```\n\n```\n   8:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name=\"uxHeatConnectionMenuTool\" Caption=\"Heat Server\" ButtonType=\"DropDown\">\n```\n\n```\n   9:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>\n```\n\n```\n  10:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name=\"uxHeatApplicationMenuTool\" Caption=\"Heat App\" ButtonType=\"DropDown\" >\n```\n\n```\n  11:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>\n```\n\n```\n  12:                 <!-- Place a button in the footer of the ApplicationMenu that allows the user to quit the application. -->\n```\n\n```\n  13:                 <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n  14:                     <igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n  15:                         <igRibbon:ButtonTool Caption=\"Settings\" Command=\"local:Commands.ClearSettingsCommand\" />\n```\n\n```\n  16:                         <igRibbon:ButtonTool Caption=\"Exit\" />\n```\n\n```\n  17:                     </igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n  18:                 </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>\n```\n\n```\n  19:             </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\n```\n  20:         </igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>\n```\n\nAs you can see in line 4 there is a binding that does indeed populate the list. But I am having trouble getting the template to take. I want the Items listed as a set of radio buttons (kinda) and so I added a Template:\n\n```\n   1: <DataTemplate x:Key=\"tAvailableServers\" DataType=\"{x:Type tfs:TeamFoundationServer}\">\n```\n\n```\n   2:            <igRibbon:RadioButtonTool\n```\n\n```\n   3:                            Caption=\"{Binding Name}\"\n```\n\n```\n   4:                            Tag=\"{Binding}\"\n```\n\n```\n   5:                            LargeImage=\"ResourcesImagesTeamServerSelectIcon.png\"\n```\n\n```\n   6:                            igRibbon:MenuToolBase.MenuItemDescription=\"{Binding Url.ToString}\"/>\n```\n\n```\n   7:        </DataTemplate>\n```\n\nThis should have displayed what I wanted, but it seams to be ignored.\n\nTo allow this to work, all I needed to do was remove the x:Key from the template. But why can't I specify a template by name. What if I wanted to have two templates and choose which one was displayed…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have been trying to get a handle on doing an automated build of our Business Intelligence solutions and I am always running into problems around the (IMO badly build) BI Packages that are installed via SQL. They do not support Test, they do not support build. There has been no thought given to how people working on them are going to build test and support them and even the project files are not written in the same schema as the rest of the Visual Studio bits. I would have thought, with Team Foundation Server in its third year and second version that this would have been rectified in SQL 2008, but no such luck.\n\nToday there are enormous BI solutions out there. Some built using these tools, and everyone needs to come up with their own solutions to this problem.\n\nHere are some of the problems:\n\n- How do you automate the deployment of SSIS packages?\n- How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of SSIS packages?\n- How do you automate those tests of SSIS packages?\n- How do you automate the deployment of SSAS cubes?\n- How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of SSAS cubes?\n- How do you automate those tests of SSAS cubes?\n- How do you automate the deployment of script packages?\n- How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of script packages?\n- How do you automate those tests of script packages?\n\nThere are some answers. The visual studio team has taken on board the database piece with Visual Studio Team Edition for Databases. But the rest are languishing in perdition and there are no elegant solutions.\n\nI am bookmarking my investigation on [delicious](http://delicious.com/hinshelm/MSBuild), but it will be a long slog…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFBS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFBS)\n",

These guys host lots of useful things and the had obviously decided to host [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") as part of their offering.\n\n> _This is a really great site, I regularly send posts to our staff!  You may want to check our site \\[www.phase2.com\\] for our version of hosted TFS.  We also integrate directly with our MS Project hosted application.  We have our own internal team of developers and offer TFS at a mere fraction of what TFS Now sells it for.  And no contracts.  We would be honoured if you would either review our service or mention us._\n>\n> _**Kevin Doherty**_\n\nI agreed to review their service, but I would like to point out that I am getting nothing in return :( I am doing this just for fun.\n\nThe guys over at Phase 2 provided me a [TFS server](http://www.phase2.com/hosted_team_foundation_server_overview2.aspx) and I was surprised at both how quickly they came up with it and how fast it was. The worry was that they would be providing a cut down version, like [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com), but it is fully featured and has Reporting Services, Sharepoint and Analytical services. I tested Excel reporting (now Microsoft's recommended method, RS is dead, yippee) and customizing Work items. I also had a few question that the team over at Phase2 answered:\n\n> Q. You quote 10 users as $1,299.00! Is that per month? (Stupid question I know, but it was not specified on the site.)\n>\n> _A. Yes, this is a per month charge that includes training, support, and backup._\n>\n> Q. What is the backup offering with your service?\n>\n> A. _Standard offering: We back up all client data every night \\[incremental\\] and full backups once a week.  We store 3 weeks’ worth of full backups. This schedule can be adjusted but additional costs may be involved._\n>\n> Q. Can you provide a multi server package, for example if I had 1000 developers and needed to run SSRS, SSAS, Sharepoint and TFS on multiple servers?\n>\n> A. _Yes, we will provide dedicated services and offer custom bundles.   A standard single-server deployment for TFS is good for about 100 users, beyond which we'd need to move to multiple front-end servers with at least one backend data-tier server.  We are scaling up from blade arrays to very powerful IBM x-series 4- and 6-way servers (all running virtuals, of course) over the next few weeks so we don't yet know what our upper limit is going to be per server.  For a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would certainly apply._\n>\n> Q. What about TFWA, and WIWA?\n>\n> A. _We do support TFWA, but the client must have an account in TFS.  WIWA is something that we can install upon request, but do not by default (For simplicity).  No extra charges for this additional functionality._\n>\n> Q. What is the disaster recovery turnaround?\n>\n> A. _24 hours maximum from time of notification.   Keep in mind that this depends on what the \"disaster\" is and when it gets noticed.  If the disaster is that someone within a client's organization deleted all or part of a project but no one noticed for 8 weeks,  we could recover the environment in short order but not necessarily the data (see backup comments above.)_\n>\n> Q. Can I bundle TFS with a full environment? TFS + MOSS + Exchange + Communicator?\n>\n> A. _Absolutely, and again, for a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would apply._\n\nSo, a fantastic offering. It should be pointed out that I was using a http connection to the server and not https, but I am sure that it will be available. The costs are very reasonable and a lot better than [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/), which I was going to compare to, but alas their site is down at the time of writing.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

The most important is to give any users assigned tasks access to the tasks list that you are using for your workflow.\n\nYou will need to think hard about wither the workflow you are considering would be better as part of your team's site, or as part of another site in the Sharepoint farm as adding permission to other people on your MySite is a security risk. But the benefit may well be worth the risk.\n\nWhat we will be doing is adding any users you will be assigning workflow to the \"Contributors\" group so they will be able to delete tasks.\n\nWhen you setup your workflow you will be asked what task list you want to use for it. If you selected \"New Task List\" the system will create a task list of the name \"\\[Workflow Name\\] Tasks\".\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_13-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_28.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou will need to give users permission to this Task list, but you could have multiple task lists to allow more refined permission for different workflows.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_12-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_26.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n## Finding the task list name\n\nFirst you need to find the Task list. If you have already setup the workflow, the changes are that you have used the default, which is \"Tasks\". You can check by going to the list or document library that has the workflow and click the \"Settings\" tab and then the \"Manage\" option.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_11-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_24.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou will then be presented with all of the options for your list or library. The option you are looking for is the \"Workflow Settings\" option under \"Permissions and Management\".\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_10-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_22.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis will take you to a list of all of the workflows that are currently setup (or the create workflow page if there are none) where you need to select the workflow that you want.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_9-13-13.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_20.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis will take you to the change a workflow page and you will be able to see the name of the task list, in this case \"Example Workflow Tasks\".\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_8-12-12.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_18.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nNow we have that information we need to return to the top level of your MySite to set the permissions on your Task List.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_7-11-11.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_16.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n## Setting the permissions on a Task list\n\nNow we know the name of the task list we can set the permission on the correct list. Click on the \"View All Site Content\" button to see a list of all the bits and bobs that have already been created.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_6-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_14.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nUnder the \"Lists\" Heading you will see the \"Example Workflow Tasks\" list which is not displayed by default on the left navigation of your MySite homepage. If you click the name you will be taken directly to the list so we can edit the permissions.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_5-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_12.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAs before we will need to get to the lists options, so click the \"List Settings\".\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_4-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_10.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd again under \"Permissions and Management\" select \"Permissions for this list\".\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_3-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nBy default all lists created use the same permissions as the parent site. We need to override this so we can set specific permission for our workflow tasks. To enable specific permissions we click the \"Edit Permissions\" button which makes a copy of the existing permissions and detached the list's permission from your MySite. You will get a warning box to make you aware of this and that any changes to the top level site will no longer affect the permissions of this list.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_2-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou now have the option to delete, edit and add users to **_this list only_** as you would on any site. Add the users who you will be assigning workflow tasks to and delete any others that you do not want access.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nMake sure that you have the correct users listed in the \"Users/Groups\" box and that you only have the \"Contribute\" permission enabled. Then decide wither to send people an email to let them know that they now have access.\n\n[![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb-14-14.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nEasy J\n\nTechnorati Tags: [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [Answers](http://technorati.com/tags/Answers) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

I have been working on getting our internal team up to speed on using [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") as a full ALM tool and not just for source control. I am getting a lot of resistance on creating work items ( as this is a PM’s job !) but we are making progress.\n{ .post-img }\n\nI was off for the last couple of days and came back to a WTF moment. I noticed, upon opening my source control, that there were two “Main” folders. “Main” and “MainPreR1”.\n\nWTF?\n\nUpon enquiring it turns out that a change had been made to “R1” (legitimate) to fix a Bug (loose definition, but a definition none the less). Then the “Main” folder had been renamed and a new “Main” folder branched from “R1” and 2 new Features branched from that, leaving all the other existing branches to fend for themselves.\n\nWTFx2!\n\nIf you are not sure what I mean, then let me explain. In order to merge from “F1207” into “Main” you would need to first merge it with “MainPreR1”, then merge it with “R1”, then merge it into “Main”. And thus you have just contaminated “R1” with something that is not in “R1” but should be in “R2”. On top of this the other orphaned features can’t take advantage of new features in “R2” without contaminating “R1”… messy.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot on the right it is now under control, but it took the perpetrator the better part of the morning to get it sorted, and the are still putting the finishing touches to it (It is a good thing the do not let us have guns here in the UK). If you are interested, here are the steps that were performed to sort out this problem.\n\n1. **Zip all content in  “Fxx1” and “Fxx2”.** _To safeguard the dev work._\n2. **Delete branch “Fxx1” and “Fxx2” from source control**\n3. **Check in everything…**\n4. **Delete “Main” from source control.** _coz it is the crap one_\n5. **Check in everything**\n6. **Rename “MainPreR1” to “Main”.** _Which is the way it should have been._\n7. **Check In Everything…** _Now we are back where we started._\n8. **Merge “R1” into “Main”.** _This is the action that should have occurred in the first place._\n9. **Check in everything…**\n10. **Create Branches for “Fxx1” and “Fxx1”**\n11. **Check in everything…**\n12. **Check out “Fxx1” and “Fxx1”.**\n13. **Copy archived “Fxx1” and “Fxx2” over the top of new branch.**\n14. **Check in everything…**\n\nA long way for a short cut :)\n\nWell, at least the lesson is learned…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM)\n",

to make things a little more fun, I wanted to create the custom work item tracking control using WPF.\n\nIn order to do this you need a wrapper control that allows you to load any WPF control that inherits from IWorkItemControl.\n\nHere is an example WPF Work Item Control:\n\n\\[[Get SignOffControl.xaml.vb

This is a forms control that has the Element Host forms control to host the button. I have gone down the generic rout to minimise the amount of code I would use to create an individual “stub” when creating multiple controls.\n\nhere is an example “stub” which is created as a simple class:\n\n\\[[Get SignOffHostControl.vb source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35595&changeSetId=1459)\\] \\[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\\] \\[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\\]\n\n```\n   1: Namespace SignOff\n```\n\n```\n   2: \n```\n\n```\n   3:     Public Class SignOffHostControl\n```\n\n```\n   4:         Inherits WitCustomControlBase(Of SignOffControl)\n```\n\n```\n   5: \n```\n\n```\n   6:     End Class\n```\n\n```\n   7: \n```\n\n```\n   8: End Namespace\n```\n\n> _note: although this inherits from user control you will not be able to view it in the designer because of the generic nature of its inheritance.

This ensures that it is a WPF control that inherits from IWorkItemControl.\n\nTo create this control you need to create a new Windows Forms control and call it WitCustomControlBase. Add a WPF “Element Host” to it and make that host dock to the total area.\n\nThen we need to make the designer generic.\n\n\\[[Get WitCustomControlBase.Designer.vb

Work Item Tracking form display module does not know anything about WPF and we are just faking up the interface to allow us to use the full functionality on WPF in place of Windows Forms. We can use the same method to implement the other features like IWorkItemUserAction.\n\nWe then need a Work Item Custom Control (WICC) definition file.\n\n\\[[Get SignOffControl.wicc source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35596&changeSetId=1459)\\] \\[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\\] \\[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\\]\n\n```\n   1: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n```\n\n```\n   2: <CustomControl xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">\n```\n\n```\n   3:  <Assembly>Hinshelwood.WitCustomControls.dll</Assembly>\n```\n\n```\n   4:  <FullClassName>Hinshelwood.WitCustomControls.SignOff.SignOffHostControl</FullClassName>\n```\n\n```\n   5: </CustomControl>\n```\n\nThis is the file that tells Visual Studio what to do.\n\nThis file and the .dll need to copied to the …Application DataMicrosoftTeam FoundationWork Item TrackingCustom Controls9.0 folder.\n\nWe can now add this control to a work item by modifying the XML definition of a Work item. To test I have just replaced an existing control.\n\nYou can add this using the Power Tools process template editor.\n\n[![image](images/CreatingaWPFWorkItemControl_914D-image_thumb_4-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingaWPFWorkItemControl_914D-image_10.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe result?\n\n[![image](images/CreatingaWPFWorkItemControl_914D-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingaWPFWorkItemControl_914D-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou will notice that this control is marked as read-only, but not bad for a first pass…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [CodeProject](http://technorati.com/tags/CodeProject) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I am doing a presentation this afternoon on Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). This is the first time that I have ever presented on this topic, and I found out that I was doing it on Friday!\n\nI have put together a bunch of slides pulling information mostly from Wikipedia. I have another presentation afterwards on Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), but it is the ALM one that scares me. I already had canned slides for [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\"), but ALM is something that I have really only begun to get a handle on. I know enough to know that I do not really know anything at all :)\n\nSo why am I doing it?\n\nWell, if you are involved with [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") in the UK you will probably know, or have heard of Neil Kidd. He is the current UK \"Developer TS [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\")\" at Microsoft. I have delt with him both at events and in the context of work, and I have found him knowledgeable, helpful and patient, even when I ask stupid questions.\n\nI had heard that he was moving to another area within Microsoft (I think something to do with the TFS Rangers), but I was surprised when one of the guys (thanks Jon) I have delt with at Microsoft over the years gave me a call and asked if I would be interested in the \"Developer TS [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\")\" position... Wow, an internal recomenation...\n\nSo here I am, on an easyjet flight on my way to London.\n\nAnd I now return to the topic of this post, I do waffle so...\n\nThe reason the ALM presentation is making me anxious is quite apart from my fledgling knowlage on the subject, my slides are terrible! No really... They are so bad even I have trouble following them, or even coming up with a story behind them.\n\nI am going to have to use my slides as vague pointers and try to create a presentation on the fly...bad I know, but it is the best decision out of a bad bunch. I have an hour interview before the presentation so maybe I can do some limiting of the expectations. The second presentation on [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\") should go a little better...I hope...\n\nIf you are going for an interview at Microsoft make sure you lock yourself away for however amount of preperation time you need, with no distractions! That means no Tv, Xbox, children, wifes, family events of any kind. Preferably you should go to a cabin in the mountins with only your internet connection to keep you company... ;) Wish me luck....\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WM6](http://technorati.com/tags/WM6) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

Please specify a valid solution configuration using the Configuration and Platform properties (e.g. MSBuild.exe Solution.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=\"Any CPU\") or leave those properties blank to use the default solution configuration.  \n> C:Program FilesMSBuildMicrosoftVisualStudiov9.0TeamDataMicrosoft.Data.Schema.SqlTasks.targets(58,5): error MSB4018: The \"SqlBuildTask\" task failed unexpectedly.  \n> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.  \n>    at Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamSystem.Data.Tasks.TaskHostLoader.Load(ITaskHost providedHost)  \n>    at Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamSystem.Data.Tasks.DbBuildTask.Execute()  \n>    at Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine.TaskEngine.ExecuteInstantiatedTask(EngineProxy engineProxy, ItemBucket bucket, TaskExecutionMode howToExecuteTask, ITask task, Boolean& taskResult)\n\nAfter reading up, I am none the wiser, but I did find information that implied that installing SP1 for [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") should fix the problem and not require that I update the TFS server. We are using GDR bits, so I will be installing GDR 16 and the SQL Server 2008 Business  Intelligence bits.\n\n**UPDATE: So after jut updating the GDR, I got the solution to build! Not sure why there was an error in the 2005 solution!**\n\nSources:\n\n[http://ozgrant.com/2008/02/28/testcontainer-in-team-build-2008-doesnt-work-for-load-tests-or-web-tests/](http://ozgrant.com/2008/02/28/testcontainer-in-team-build-2008-doesnt-work-for-load-tests-or-web-tests/ \"http://ozgrant.com/2008/02/28/testcontainer-in-team-build-2008-doesnt-work-for-load-tests-or-web-tests/\")\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFBS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFBS) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

You can add the features to an existing project by editing the project definition file to add a property group:\n\n```\n   1: <PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n```\n   2:   <TXLINQBinDir Condition=\"'$(TXLINQBinDir)' == ''\">$(ProgramFiles)LINQ to XSD PreviewBin</TXLINQBinDir>\n```\n\n```\n   3: </PropertyGroup>\n```\n\nAnd an import reference:\n\n```\n   1: <Import Project=\"$(TXLINQBinDir)LinqToXsd.targets\" />\n```\n\nnote: if you are using MSBuild or Team Build you will need to install this add on there as well....\n\nNow that you have a project, when you add an XSD you will have extra Build Actions available. Once you have set all of your XSD files to this Action and build, you will have classes for all of your XSD's.

    "BodyContent": "Calling a method on an instance of an object in WPF is not as easy to figure out, but with the help of this Internet thing I managed it.\n\nSay you have a DataTemplate that renders a WorkItemType as a button that is selectable:\n\n```\n   1: <DataTemplate DataType=\"{x:Type tfswitc:WorkItemType}\">\n```\n\n```\n   2:     <DockPanel>\n```\n\n```\n   3:         <Image

defined as:\n\n```\n   1: Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client\n```\n\n```\n   2: \n```\n\n```\n   3: Namespace TeamFoundationExtensions\n```\n\n```\n   4: \n```\n\n```\n

SupportedByHeat(ByVal wit As WorkItemType) As Boolean\n```\n\n```\n  10:             Dim c As Controlers.TeamSystemControler(Of MainWindow)\n```\n\n```\n  11:             c = Application.ControlerFactory.GetControler(Of Controlers.TeamSystemControler(Of MainWindow))()\n```\n\n```\n  12:             Return c.CheckWorkItemField(wit)\n```\n\n```\n  13:         End Function\n```\n\n```\n  14: \n```\n\n```\n  15:     End Module\n```\n\n```\n  16: \n```\n\n```\n  17: End Namespace\n```\n\nAnd this does not seam to work even if I import the namespace in the

We need some way of moving and syncing items between these two systems.\n{ .post-img }\n\n[![TFS Heat ITSM start screen](images/HeatITSM_78C9-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HeatITSM_78C9-image_2.png) I completed the first part by using my [TFS Event Handler](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSEventHandler.aspx) project and that piece is live. If you put a field on any work item called \"HeatITSM.Ref\" and you fill it out (manually) with an ID from Heat then every time you change the work item it will update heat with a \"Note\" attached to that \"Call\". This was very easy using the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") Event Handler model, but it still means that you need to create the Work Item manually.\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe next step is to create a [TFS Heat ITSM](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSHeatITSM.aspx) application that loads all the calls for a specific \"Application\" (category) and allows you to create a Work Item with a single click.\n\n[![TFS Heat ITSM Work Item creation screen](images/HeatITSM_78C9-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HeatITSM_78C9-image_4.png) Well, I have been working on it, and the [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com) site is up, and a initial Alfa application is there, but I an doing a refactor at the moment as things were getting a little complicated and confusing on the code side so a simplification was required.\n{ .post-img }\n\nAs you can see from the screen shots I am using the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) base code as a starting point and working from there, although during the refactor I am making a lot of changes that will benefit Sticky Buddy v2.0 as well.\n\nWell, Back to the code face :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [TFS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2008) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

I will come back to that, but first...\n\nThe reason for my lack of my \"can't live without accesory\" is that my laptop has finaly given up the ghost. It is an 8 year old Dell desktop replacemnt, and in my infinite wisdom I desided to install Vista just after it went RTM. All was well for a while, but it was a litle slow. Add Visual Studio 2005 and things got a little slower...\n\nIt took aroung 3 months to sucessfuly get SP1 installed, yes I was one of those unfortinate users that had problems, and my laptop has never been the same since. For example, uninstalling VS2008 Beta and moving to the RTM took near enough 74 hours...Not good...\n\nWell, it worked for a month and then started blue screening. Could be anything, but when I bit the bullet last night and desided to go back to XP I kept getting errors reading the disk which could on reflection be the disk, but I have a feeling that the hardware is toast...\n\nSo here I am writing this post on my phone and its not such a bad experience, although I have found that many sites talking about mobile software and devices don't actualy support viewing on a mobile device! What is that about...\n\nI needed to look for some software to write this post, and obviously I found it, but it did require me to use most of the bits that an average person uses on a computer.  \n\\- Searching the internet  \n\\- Loading and reading web pages  \n\\- Downloading and instaling software  \n\\- Writing documents\n\nOn top of this, although I have never used it, I have a cut down version of Office 2007.\n\nTaking allof this into acount I have found it a relatively painless experience, but I do accnowlage that I am not an average user and a terrible speller...\n\nNow all I need is a version of Visual Studio 2008 and Team Explorer ;)\n\nTechnorati tags: [Windows Mobile](http://technorati.com/tag/Windows+Mobile), [Blogging](http://technorati.com/tag/Blogging)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WM6](http://technorati.com/tags/WM6) [Answers](http://technorati.com/tags/Answers) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

How about the ability to create a conceptual model of your data from multiple databases that hides your application from database schema changes ([**ADO.NET Entity Framework**](http://www.asp.net/learn/3.5-SP1/video-245.aspx)). That's just in the [ASP.NET and ADO](http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-SP1/default.aspx) bags, not to mention the WPF performance improvements and the ClickOnce improved install process as well as being able to customise said process and the ability to deploy application with a cut down version of the .NET Framework that has a smaller footprint (20mb as opposed to 60mb) and have the full framework streamed down over time with BITS.\n\nThe .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1 has improvements and optimisation's across the board…A good day for developers and users alike.\n\nThere are tones of performance and minor [improvements in Team Foundation Server](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/04/28/team-foundation-server-2008-sp1.aspx) as well…\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WCF](http://technorati.com/tags/WCF) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008)\n",

The reason I moved my blog was to free up the [http://hinshelwood.com](http://hinshelwood.com) URL for use as a personal site that then links to my blog. When you do this you need to consider all of your current users, bookmarks, feeds, links and all that malarkey.\n\nSo, I created a WebRedirect (thanks to DynDNS.org) that means that all hinshelwood.com traffic is automatically redirected to blog.hinshelwood.com including all of the sub pages. This is fine until I actually put up a site on hinshelwood.com and brake all of the links… HttpHandler to the rescue…\n\nThe first step was to create a “BlogRedirectHandler” to redirect all of those pesky URL’s to the new site.\n\n```\nImports System.Text.RegularExpressions\nImports System.Web\n\nNamespace Core.Handlers\n\n    Public Class BlogRedirectHandler\n        Implements IHttpHandler\n\n        Private Shared m_Patterns() As String = {\"/archive/*\", _\n                                                 \"/Tag/*/default.aspx\", _\n                                                 \"/category/*\"}\n\n        Public Shared Function IsValidToRun(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext, _\n                                            ByVal requestType As String, _\n                                            ByVal virtualPath As String, _\n                                            ByVal path As String) As Boolean\n            For Each p In m_Patterns\n                If Regex.IsMatch(context.Request.Url.ToString, p) Then Return True\n            Next\n            Return False\n        End Function\n\n        Public ReadOnly Property IsReusable() As Boolean Implements IHttpHandler.IsReusable\n            Get\n                Return True\n            End Get\n        End Property\n\n        Public Sub ProcessRequest(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext) Implements IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest\n            Dim oldurl As String = context.Request.Url.ToString\n            If oldurl.Contains(\"/archive/\") Then\n                Dim newurl As String = \"http://blog.hinshelwood.com\" & context.Request.Url.AbsolutePath\n                context.Response.StatusCode = System.Net.HttpStatusCode.MovedPermanently ' permanent HTTP 301\n                context.Response.RedirectLocation = newurl\n                context.Response.StatusDescription = \"Moved Permanently\"\n                context.Response.ContentType = \"text/html\"\n                context.Response.Write(\"<html><head><title>Object Moved</title></head><body>\")\n                context.Response.Write(\"<h2>Object moved to <a href=\" & newurl & \" >here</a>.</h2>\")\n                context.Response.Write(\"</body></html>\")\n                context.Response.End()\n            End If\n\n        End Sub\n\n    End Class\n\nEnd Namespace\n```\n\nThis little piece of code has two important pieces, the “IsValidToRun” which makes sure that we need to run it, and the “ProcessRequest” method that does the actual dog work of the redirect.\n\nI have chosen to use a “MovedPermanently“ status so that the search engines will catch on more quickly and the new URL should quite quickly replace the old.\n\nIf we just added this handler to the web application we would loose all of our .aspx pages and only see a blank page for those that are not valid for this handler.\n\nTo handle this the easiest way is to inherit from the existing “PageHandlerFactory” that is the default in ASP.NET.\n\n```\nImports System.Web\n\nNamespace Core.Handlers\n\n    Public Class CustomPageHandlerFactory\n        Inherits PageHandlerFactory\n\n        Public Overrides Function GetHandler(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext, _\n                                             ByVal requestType As String, _\n                                             ByVal virtualPath As String, _\n                                             ByVal path As String) As IHttpHandler\n            If BlogRedirectHandler.IsValidToRun(context, requestType, virtualPath, path) Then\n                Return New BlogRedirectHandler\n            Else\n                Return MyBase.GetHandler(context, requestType, virtualPath, path)\n            End If\n        End Function\n    End Class\n\nEnd Namespace\n```\n\nThen all we need to do is call our IsValidToRun method and either run the base (default) GetHandler or return our new handler…\n\n> Technorati Tags: [.NET 3.5](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET+3.5),[.NET 2.0](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET)\n",

    "BodyContent": "![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_6-4-4.png)Well the faeces hit the fan at work today...let me explain...\n{ .post-img }\n\nWe have a completely unmanaged Sharepoint Portal server at work. It was installed in early 2004 and has been running in self service mode ever since. Not all of the company is using it, but those that are, are using it heavily. Particularly areas that service customers and one customer specifically use it so completely that that area of the business would find it hard to function if it was not available.\n\nSo early this year I started a project to migrate / rewrite for Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server (MOSS) and we now have a proof of concept site online that demos the features and architecture of a finished portal. This POC version was scheduled for go live in Q4...\n\nThis had been ticking over for a while with a number of project requests getting in the way, the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) for one, along with many others. As the only .NET developer in EMEA it can get a little hectic.\n\n[![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_4.png)Recently I had a project to make a copy of one of the Sharepoint 2003 portals and I ran into a number of problems... now, I am not a Sharepoint 2003 guru, having had most of my exposure to it with Team Foundation Server deployments, but I followed all of the documented approaches for copying a site, to no avail. For each attempt, of which there were many, and for each approach, again there were many, I ran into problem after problem. Either the export commands failed, or the import command failed, and the resultant restore looked nothing like the original having been mangled during the process.\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe result of my efforts was a custom APS.NET application that replicated the functionality provided by Sharepoint (it is worth noting that the site did not use much of SharePoint to do its job). Problem solved...\n\nBut not really... I still had a soon to be mangled Sharepoint 2003 portal server with over a thousand users on it.\n\n[![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_6.png) Then the bomb shell landed... I had been getting some reports of problems for the users of a site that is used to handle a customers contract, these users were running into real performance issues and functionality limitations. They were aware of the proof of concept MOSS deployment and wanted a look, so when some of the guys were in the office I stupidly, as I always do, started showing off MOSS features and functionality that puts Sharepoint Portal server to shame. How stupid of me... in my zeal to get MOSS deployed to the business I inadvertently stepped on a land mine. They went home, spoke to a few people and lo and behold, my deadline has been moved up from Q4 to now.... or at leas as soon as possible, and specifically for the aforementioned site.\n{ .post-img }\n\n**The Plan**\n\n[![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_5-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_12.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nApart from quitting, having a nervous breakdown and ultimately committing [Seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku) I had to come up with a way of fulfilling this insane idea of a deployment schedule.\n\nTo do this I plan to use the Business Data Catalog to connect to customer data, and create a portal site that dynamically build sites using an as yet non existent site template for a specified customer. This way there is system data available for creating excel services reports and stats along with document library and InfoPath forms. The site should look exactly like the My Sites, but for a customer. It can then be branched out for other entitles like products (we build them and then rent and service them) and contracts.\n\nIn the immortal words of the Windows 2003 Active Directory Installer:\n\n> _This may take some time, or considerably longer..._\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

It displays all the work items loaded (by selecting a Team Query) on the node, colour coded by Work Item State.\n\nYou can edit and add templates for displaying Work Items loaded for different Life Cycle templates in Team Foundation Server by editing the XAML in the Life Cycle resource directory (#InstallLocation#RDdotNetTFS Sticky BuddyResourcesLifeCycle\\[Name\\]\\[Name\\]Resources.xaml) and editing the resource file. Though I would suggest creating a new file for each Life Cycle you want to display. Out of the box I have supported a Default option that works for most TFS Process Templates, and a Codeplex option for supporting your Codeplex projects.\n\n**Usage**\n\nWhen the TFS Sticky Buddy application starts you will be prompted to select a team foundation server from the list (if you do not see any servers then you must set them up using Team Explorer) which will populate the Projects and other menus. The navigation diagram will by default render the first project in your selected TFS server.\n\nUse the \"Queries\" menu to select which work items that you want loaded into your view.\n\n**System Requirements**\n\n.NET Framework 3.5 Visual Studio 2008 Team Explorer (not forced) Access to a Team Foundation Server (not provided)\n\nIf you already have CTP1 or CTP2 you should [update](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) to the [full release now](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx)...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

I needed to look at methods of presentation of hierarchical information graphically using WPF and I saw this as a good representation of that sort of data. So I se about not only converting it to VB.NET but adding generics to the mix.\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe first part of the application is the core objects that represent the data and allow interaction in a way that WPF can handle. This means using Observable Collections and implementing INotifyPropertyChanged to allow a higher level of interaction. I wanted to support any Source object type as well as my own custom types, so the type needed to be nested with a Wrapper that gives the illusion that it is a solid type, but in actual fact it is a soft wrapper that allows the system to interact with it without really understanding the type. The specific understanding of the type is done at a much higher level.\n\nYou will need to open this diagram in a new window to get the effect, but it is a completely generic representation of Parent, Child and  Sibling relationships for any object regardless of wither you have access to the source or not.\n\nThis is not currently designed to be an editable object, but inheriting from the [ItemWrapper](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=157013&changeSetId=10168) class would allow this, but would require a modification to the framework to handle the inherited type.

If you still want to use it you can _\"My.User.InitializeWithWindowsUser()\"_ to have it setup, but there is a better way.\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you are using Active Directory .Net 3.5 has provided a new way to access information...\n\nThere is a new assembly called \"System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement\" that encapsulates all of the logic for accessing security information in a number of ways.\n\nYou can create a link to your local Active Directory  by calling:\n\n> ```\n>  Dim ctx As New PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain)\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThe options for conencting are:\n\n- **ApplicationDirectory** - The application directory store. This represents the AD LDS store.\n\n- **Domain** - The domain store. This represents the AD DS store.\n\n- **Machine** - The computer store. This represents the SAM store.\n\nThese options allow for most security authentications in your .NET applications, and it does not stop with wrapping the top level AD. if you want to access and control a user you need only:\n\n> ```\n> Dim u As UserPrincipal = UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(ctx, IdentityType.Sid, WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent.User.Value)\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nI really like this as often I have has to build and Google (more the later than the former) class library for manipulating Active Directory objects, and you need not just use the Sid. You can use:\n\n- **DistinguishedName** - The identity is a Distinguished Name (DN).\n\n- **Guid** - The identity is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).\n\n- **Name** - The identity is a name.\n\n- **SamAccountName** - The identity is a Security Account Manager (SAM) name.\n\n- **Sid** - The identity is a Security Identifier (SID) in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) format.\n\n- **UserPrincipalName** - The identity is a User Principal Name (UPN).\n\nAnd this is just the direct load of a user object. There are Group object as well as fill search capability with the PrincipalSearcher and various other bits and bobs...\n\nWell thats my find of the day ![smile_nerd](images/smile_nerd-3-3.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

It was not just that tables and panels don't work as I expected, but that there were way to many bits that were more difficult than they should be. This is mostly down to my inexperience and down right ineptitude with graphics and UI's, but it still should not be this hard. ![smile_baringteeth](images/smile_baringteeth-4-2.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI know that the picture on the right is not pretty, and the colours I have picked are pretty random to help solve the layout issues, but the application works....\n\nThe problems, as you can see from the image are layout ones. I tried the FlowLayoutPanel, but I could for the life of me, not get the bloody boxes to stretch to fit the contents. Then I used the TableLayoutPanel, and ran into what you see above...Yeuch ![smile_sniff](images/smile_sniff-6-4.gif) (Scottish for Yuck (Like Loch)).\n{ .post-img }\n\nI guess I spent too much time doing web development when I was younger, but now when I try to go back to web based stuff I always end up shouting and swearing at the html layouts and growling at the post-back functionality...\n\nWhat I needed was something that was a cross between Windows Forms, and Web Forms. Something that had good layout functionality, but without the messing around necessary with HTML and CSS. You see, I like HTML and CSS, except for one little thing... It never does what you tell it. At least forms do what you tell them, and that is sometimes the problem with forms, they do ONLY what you tell them.![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-7-5.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI had only spent a day on the application so far, so I was not overly concerned about the loss of time. I had chosen Windows Forms because I knew it, but deep down I knew that Windows Presentation Foundation was the way to go, I was just scared of the steep clime of understanding...![smile_nerd](images/smile_nerd-5-3.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\n[![TFS Sticky Buddy (WPF) Screenshot](images/TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_thumb_1-1-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_4.png) Sod it...Of I went with a WPF version... And the result were impressive. Not only have I only spent a day and a half on it, but the immediate learning curve is a lot smaller than I though. Sure, you can add styles and templates among other things, but to get what you get with Windows Forms (only prettier) takes less time, not more, even with the learning curve (but I guess that is dependant on how quick you are ![smile_wink](images/smile_wink-8-6.gif)). And I am sure that once I master the other functionality provided in WPF it will become much easer.\n{ .post-img }\n\nSure, if you look at the image for the second WPF version you will still see layout problems, but they are minor and fixable (although I am not sure how yet), and the whole thing was a more painless to tweak.\n\nI will try to release these two versions along with the source code today, but just as a POC (Proof of Concept) to show the potential of the application.\n\nI want to have nice little callouts of information when you move your mouse over a work item or Area/Iteration, and I am continuing to work on it....\n\n[Technorati Profile](http://technorati.com/claim/vbgrtargkp)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

Now, maybe this would not have caused a problem if I was not using a single server deployment with SQL server on the same box...\n\nThat's the way the OS crumbles ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-9-9.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnyway, I am installing from a blank VM helpfully provided by our Infrastructure team. The plan is to install all updates before installing MOSS, this includes .NET 3.5 as some of the applications I will be putting on the server will be using it.\n\n[![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you just try and run the MOSS install you get a nice little message detailing what you need to install as pre-requisites. I have my .NET 3.5 install running, so that should take care of all but IIS...\n\n## Install SQL\n\nYou will need SQL Server installed. As this is a development box and I don't have any licensing consideration for development environments under our enterprise agreement I am using \"Developer Edition\" which is identical to \"Enterprise Edition\" of SQL Server. And I am not using a default instance. I will soon be in the possession of a SQL Server 2005 Cluster and all of my systems. SharePoint and [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") will have their databases moved onto that server.\n\nNow, due to the security requirements of these systems (TFS required DBO and SharePoint required DBCreator) Each one will have its own instance.\n\nTFS is easy enough to move between servers, but SharePoint is NOT. It would require a full backup (from within SharePoint) and restore to move the databases. But I have a plan.. the [The SharePoint Plan: Database move headache mitigation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/31/the-sharepoint-plan-database-move-headache-mitigation.aspx), but I have know idea wither it will work.\n\nAnyway, since my SQL Server install is finished...back to the SharePoint install..\n\n## Install Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition\n\n[![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nMake sure that you keep your product key safe, as I have lost mine again... ![smile_cry](images/smile_cry-8-8.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThank goodness for MSDN...\n\n[![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAt the end of the install you get prompted to open the Configuration pages. Well, I'm not.. I am going to get a \"VM Snapshot\" taken of the server at this point. That should allow me to get back to this point at any time...\n\nAs Service Pack 1 is now available for SharePoint I want to start with SP1. So the next step is to install WSS 3.0 SP1 and then MOS SP1.\n\n## Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1\n\nHopefully if I install SP1 at this time I will not run into all the problems I (and a lot of other people) had [last time](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx \"Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1)\").\n\n[![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAw, crap..

I really do hope that it allows me to change the database location without messing around with SharePoint backups.\n\nAnd that's the WSS 3.0 SP1 update on successfully, and with no errors...\n\n## Installing Microsoft Office System Server Service Pack 1\n\nOK, I now have high hopes for this installation as well. After the last one, there does seam to be a likelihood that this will work...\n\n[![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_5-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_12.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nSuccess...Ran though fine...\n\nWell that's it all installed, just waiting for my SPN's so I can start adding sites ![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-10-10.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

    "BodyContent": "If you want to use Kerberos authentication and not NTLM with SharePoint then there are some extra tasks that you need to get someone with Domain Admin privileges to perform. For EVERY dns / port combination a SPN needs to be added to Active Directory to tell it that it  is allowed to use Kerberos to authenticate a specific account or server to that URL. In a production environment with a farm of multiple server you will need to use the account option.\n\nThe account option lets you create an Active Directory account called..say... svc_Sharepoint and add a bunch of SPN's to it. This account then needs to be used to run the application you are trying to connect to. So if it is an IIS website then the AppPool needs to run under that account. if it is SQL Server then the services need to run under that account.\n\nYou need to add an SPN for each protocol URL and port combination:\n\n> setspn -a admin.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a admin.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz:8080 \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a bi.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a nrcdashboard.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz     \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a team.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a search.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a my.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a technet.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_sharepoint  \n> setspn -a tfs01.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_tfsservices  \n> setspn -a tfs01.ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz:8080 \\[domain\\]svc_tfsservices  \n> setspn -a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\").ep-dev.\\[domain\\].biz \\[domain\\]svc_tfsservices\n\nThese SPN's will allow authentication to work on these domains, but it does require Domain Admin to run them. And these are only my initial FQDN for this environment. We will be having a production environment soon and most likely a UAT environment before we start any development work on our Enterprise Portal.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

I was asked to provide an application that would fin all of the permissions set against Active Directory accounts that have been since removed. These normally show up in the permissions dialogs for folders as the full SID of the account as there is no longer nay way to look it up in Active Directory.\n{ .post-img }\n\n[![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_4.png)I have written a nice little threaded application that lets you select a folder and it finds all of the dead accounts. What it actually does is verify all accounts against Active Directory and flags them if they are not found. This will have the side effect of finding groups and local accounts and thinking they are dead as well. To solve this problem I added a \"Safe List\" of accounts and as way to add them from the GUI.

As I moved on to actually deleting the offending ACL's on request, I found it was a little more difficult to actually delete them as .NET seams to ignore my code...\n\n> ```\n> Private Sub RemoveACL(ByVal DirectoryName As String, _\n>                       ByVal IdentityReference As Security.Principal.IdentityReference)\n>     Dim DS As DirectorySecurity\n>     DS = System.IO.Directory.GetAccessControl(DirectoryName)\n>\n>     DS.PurgeAccessRules(IdentityReference)\n>     DS.PurgeAuditRules(IdentityReference)\n>\n>     System.IO.Directory.SetAccessControl(DirectoryName, DS)\n> End Sub\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nNow, this code is fairly simple. First we get the directory security object, then we change the directory security object, and then we save the directory security object.\n\nThe \"DirectoryName\" object contains a CuteFTP folder:\n\n[![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe \"IdentityReference\" object contains the offending SID:\n\n[![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_3-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis code should work, and I have used a similar piece to add permissions, so why on earth can't I remove them!\n\n**UPDATE:** [**I have added a question about this to the MSDN Forums**](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2722189&SiteID=1&mode=1)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET)\n",

    "BodyContent": "[Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com) is getting a face lift and [David Silverlight](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/default.aspx) (yes a man so great that an entire platform was named after him) is asking for [contributions](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) to this... So head on over to the [community credit forum](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) and get suggesting...\n\nMy Suggestions:\n\n- [The ability to have blog posts submitted into a specific category, or moved to that category.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4315/ShowThread.aspx#4315)\n  You should be able to change the category from an automatically submitted contribution.\n  This should be possible in two ways...\n  1\\. manually: users should be able to login and change the status of an automatically submitted entry. If they change it, it would require moderation...\n  2\\. tagging: users can add tags to their posts that could automate the above process. CC would parse the page and extract the tag and change the category.\n  I think that the first option is required, but the second is optional....\n- [Profile page uses username and not email address...](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4316/ShowThread.aspx#4316)\n  We don't want spammers getting to our email addresses...\n  Username should be used whenever displaying user data, that way our email addresses will not be visible...\n- [All profiles should be listed.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4318/ShowThread.aspx#4318)\n  It is not possible to Google for your profile and this should be possible. My profile does come up, but I created a mapped URL and put it on my blog.\n- [Search engine optimisation / Faster load times for pages.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4319/ShowThread.aspx#4319)\n  I think these two go hand in hand. They pages for the site should be lighter on graphics and that should make them load quicker. If a little though was put towards SEO then more people would find the pages, especially the profiles within the site.. Any page that comes up would push traffic to the site...\n- [Points for moderating Credits](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4320/ShowThread.aspx#4320)\n  If, like me, you are a moderator for credits (not the discussion boards) then there should be a points system for it. it should be based on how much work is involved in moderating the submission.\n\n      Maybe a good way would be to give the moderator 10% of the points awarded to the user ![Smile](images/emotion-1.gif). This would certainly make me happy.\n\n  { .post-img }\n  Articles are especially difficult to moderate as you need to search the web for similar titles and correlate dates.\n\n- [Guest developers](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4321/ShowThread.aspx#4321)\n  It should be possible to drive traffic to the forums and encourage users to use them if you have guest developers for topics.\n  This would have a specific person with a specific skills moderating and answering forum posts on a specific topic. That developer would get extra points for being a Guest Developer and all his/her posts marked as \"Expert answers\".\n  This will provide developers with a sense of Ownership of the forums without having to have everyone as a moderator all of the time. the \"Guest Developer\" feature should be limited to a specific forum for a specific time.\n\nThat's all I can think of just now, but I may be back ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif) \n{ .post-img }\n\n**If you have any comments on these topics can you please use the title links to get to the forum and post them there...**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [Silverlight](http://technorati.com/tags/Silverlight)\n",

If you edit the \"All Items\" view you will see a list of columns that do not have the display option checked.\n\nThere are quite a few of these columns that exist but that are never displayed, like \"Created By\" and \"Created\". These fields are used within SharePoint, but they are not displayed by default so as not to clutter up the display. You can't edit these fields, but you can display them to the user. if you check the \"Display\" box beside the ID field you will get a unique and auto-generated ID field displayed in your list.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [Answers](http://technorati.com/tags/Answers) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

I wanted to be able to add a method to this called \"ToInstanceString\" that I would use to both display your Status, and to detect when it had changed.\n\nIn VB.NET you add Extension methods to a Module. One thing worth noting is that you can control the scope of the extension method with the Namespace.

Although this one is specific to this application, you can probably see many circumstances where you could create generic and useful methods to add to things like collections and the like...\n\nHave fun...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET)\n",

In VB.NET you need to use late binding so you can't change the \"Option strict\" compiler option to true as I have always done in the past. This option, that defaults to \"Off\", is the main reason that C# developers scoff at VB, but this feature is now available, controversially in C#.\n{ .post-img }\n\nIn this example I created an anonymous type that has three properties.\n\n> ```\n>     Public Function GetTwiterCredentials() As Object\n>         If Not My.Settings.TwitterEmail.Length > 3 Then\n>             GetSettings()\n>         End If\n>         If Not My.Settings.TwitterPassword.Length > 3 Then\n>             GetSettings()\n>         End If\n>         If Not My.Settings.TwitterUsername.Length > 3 Then\n>             GetSettings()\n>         End If\n>         Return New With { _\n>                     .Email = My.Settings.TwitterEmail, _\n>                     .Password = My.Settings.TwitterPassword, _\n>                     .Username = My.Settings.TwitterUsername _\n>                         }\n>     End Function\n> ```\n\nThe use of this is very simple, although I would like an option other than to return \"Object\" so Visual Studio knows that it is an anonymous type.\n\n> ```\n>             Dim TwiterCredentials = View.GetTwiterCredentials\n>             Dim result As String = \"\"\n>             result = Twitter.TwitterAPI.UpdateStatus( _\n>                                     status, _\n>                                     TwiterCredentials.Email, _\n>                                     TwiterCredentials.Password _\n>                                     )\n> ```\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThere is no intellisense with this, so you have to know what the options are. Hopefully in future versions this will be rectified.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET)\n",
