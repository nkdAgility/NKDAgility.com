One of my colleagues is facing the maelstrom that is corporate blogjection and has become [a geek with a blog](http://geekswithblogs.net/RoddyCrossan/archive/2009/08/21/sql-server-function-to-add-working-days-on-to-a.aspx). Have a heart as he is a poor under-paid support analyst who hits WAY above his pay grade.

Welcome [Roddy](http://geekswithblogs.net/RoddyCrossan)… good first post on [SQL Server Function to add working days on to a date](http://geekswithblogs.net/RoddyCrossan/archive/2009/08/21/sql-server-function-to-add-working-days-on-to-a.aspx), I always wanted to know how to do that!
