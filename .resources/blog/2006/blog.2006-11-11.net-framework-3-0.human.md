At last .NET Framework 3.0 is live! I have been desperate to use it in work ever since I got a book on Indigo as I can see so many applications for it that would increase developer productivity and consistency.

I have upgraded my CodePlex project to use WCF, and what a difference it makes:

- Cleaner code
- less code
- more functionality

It is amazing what a few attribute tags can make.
