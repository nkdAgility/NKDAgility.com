Just found a new services from Microsoft called [Soapbox](http://soapbox.msn.com/). It is similar to YouTube, but I assumed it would be implemented using [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/). But as it turns out, its Flash! Boo....

[Video: The Fish Diet](http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=6f9ee93f-ab6e-481e-99dd-9652a4671804 "The Fish Diet")

Looks good and works through our firewall though!
