    Every Scrum Team must explicitly define what “Done” means. Without it, you are not doing Scrum. Let’s be clear: if your product increment cannot be shipped, tested, and validated at least every 30 days, you’re missing the point. Scrum is a social technology for adaptive solutions, and the Definition of Done (DoD) is the core commitment to quality that enables reliable, transparent, and releasable increments.

    ## How Does the Agile Manifesto Relate?

    While the Definition of Done is specific to Scrum, its essence connects directly to the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. The manifesto doesn’t define a DoD explicitly, but it demands **working software as the primary measure of progress** and calls for **continuous attention to technical excellence and good design**. These principles implicitly require teams to set and meet clear standards of completeness and quality.

    In Agile, “Done” is characterised not by formal documents or bureaucratic sign-offs but by **tangible, working outcomes**. The focus is on delivering increments of value that are potentially shippable, ensuring continuous feedback, and maintaining sustainable pace. This spirit is what Scrum formalises with its Definition of Done: an explicit, transparent commitment to what quality means, grounded in Agile’s broader ethos of delivering working software and embracing change.

    ## Why Define Done?

    The Definition of Done is not optional. It is the shared understanding that tells everyone — Developers, Product Owner, stakeholders — what quality bar each increment must meet to be considered usable, releasable, and valuable. Without it, you deliver chaos disguised as agility.

    If your organisation has no defined standards, your team must create its own. But let’s be blunt: if you have multiple teams on one product, they must align on a shared Definition of Done. No excuses, no fragmentation. Without this alignment, you jeopardise integration, delivery, and the product’s reputation.

    > “The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review.”
    > — Scrum Guide 2020

    ## Done Means Releasable

    Done is not about user stories, requirements, or business value. It is about whether the increment is in a state that the Product Owner can say, “Yes, let’s ship it.” No hidden work, no deferred testing, no “we’ll fix it later.”

    A robust Definition of Done ensures:

    - Transparency on what’s been completed.
    - Predictability in delivery.
    - Shared accountability for quality.
    - Protection of the product’s and organisation’s reputation.

    ## Start with a Seed, Grow It Over Time

    Your DoD does not need to be perfect on day one, but you do need to start. Run a facilitated DoD workshop. Involve the Scrum Team, relevant stakeholders, and anyone representing critical gates like security, architecture, UX, and compliance. Define what “Done” looks like across four layers:

    1. **Organisational DoD** – minimum standards to protect reputation and compliance.
    2. **Practice DoD** – engineering or discipline-specific standards (e.g., security, performance).
    3. **Customer DoD** – any client-specific requirements.
    4. **Team DoD** – additional agreements the team needs to deliver quality.

    Without this clarity, you’re not managing risk; you’re just rolling dice.

    ## Characteristics of a Strong Definition of Done

    - **Short, measurable checklist** — automate verification wherever possible.
    - **Mirrors shippable** — the Product Owner should have the option to ship at the Sprint Review (if not doing continuous delivery).
    - **No further work required** — if additional work is needed, you weren’t Done.

    This is not subjective. “Approved by the Product Owner” is not a DoD item. The DoD is an objective, verifiable standard.

    ## Examples of DoD Items

    Here’s what good engineering practices might embed:

    - Code passes automated quality checks (e.g., SonarQube) with no new critical issues.
    - Unit, integration, and acceptance tests are automated and pass.
    - Security scans run in CI/CD pipelines and show no high-severity vulnerabilities.
    - Documentation is updated and linked to the increment.
    - Code reviews or pair/mob programming sessions completed.
    - Automated deployment pipelines confirm repeatable, error-free delivery.

    ## Continuous Reflection and Improvement

    Your DoD is not static. You must review and improve it continuously — at least every Sprint Retrospective. When you uncover new failure points, you integrate them into your DoD.

    If your increment no longer meets the quality bar, stop Sprinting. Fix the foundation first — that’s called a **Scrumble**. It’s a deliberate pause to repair quality, not a failure. Once resolved, your DoD should evolve to prevent recurrence.

    ## Practical Steps

    1. **Run a DoD Workshop** — include Developers, Product Owner, stakeholders, and relevant experts.
    2. **Document and Share** — make the DoD visible, accessible, and owned by the team.
    3. **Automate** — reduce human error by automating checks wherever feasible.
    4. **Review Regularly** — build DoD reviews into retrospectives.

    ## Final Word

    The Definition of Done is not bureaucracy. It’s the backbone of your Scrum implementation. Without it, you don’t have empirical process control; you have chaos. Without it, you can’t deliver continuous value; you deliver continuous risk.

    Professional Scrum Teams are accountable for quality. Own it. Define it. Evolve it.

    > Always ask: “Would you be happy to release this increment to production and support it? You are on call tonight.” If the answer is no, it’s not Done.

    Capacity planning is not about filling calendars or counting resource hours. It is about flow, system constraints, and predictability. And importantly, what we are talking about here applies even within environments of strict budgets, immovable deadlines, and rigorous accountabilities. Lean approaches do not discard discipline; they reframe how we achieve predictability, accountability, and sustainable delivery by focusing on the system, not just the parts. These ideas align directly with the Scrum ethos of empirical process control and the Kanban strategy of observing and managing work-in-progress limits to enhance value delivery.

    Too many organisations frame capacity as “how many hours does each person have?” or “how many tasks can we assign this sprint?” They fall into the trap of breaking complex, systemic work into artificial personal quotas, focusing on individual loading rates instead of collective flow. This leads to managers obsessing over how ‘utilised’ each person is, mistaking busyness for progress. Teams become overloaded with microtasks, pulled into multitasking, and lose sight of flow efficiency and value creation. This mindset traps them in local optimisations, overload, and multitasking chaos. Everyone looks busy, but value delivery crumbles. Deadlines slip, work piles up, and predictability collapses.

    We need to shift from individual task-level tracking and micromanagement to managing the system of work.

    ## Three Levels of Capacity Planning: Strategic, Category, Team

    Effective capacity planning happens at three distinct but connected levels: portfolio (strategic), category (product or business unit), and team (execution). Each level has its own constraints, its own levers, and its own accountabilities. If you blur these levels, you end up with local optimisations, overloaded systems, and unpredictable delivery. If you handle them deliberately, you enable scalable, reliable flow across the entire organisation. This post lays out what matters at each level, where most organisations fail, and how to focus on the right system levers to improve predictability and value delivery.

    ### Portfolio Level (Strategic)

    At the portfolio level, individual capacity is irrelevant. Portfolio-level delivery is not the sum of people’s hours or team headcounts. It is about the system’s ability to progress and complete major initiatives across the organisation.

    Traditional project management has well-established strengths — especially in controlling scope, budget, and schedule — but repeatedly makes the same flawed assumptions when applied to complex, system-wide delivery. To connect better, we should acknowledge where traditional methods excel and then explain why they hit limits at scale or in domains like software engineering, where variability and complexity cannot be fully controlled. It assumes that if you know how many people you have and how many hours they can work, you can calculate how many projects you can run. It treats capacity as a static sum of people, ignoring system dynamics like waiting times, handoffs, coordination overhead, and priority collisions. It assumes that by assigning people to projects and filling calendars, you maximise delivery. In reality, you simply increase work in progress, dilute focus, and create organisational thrashing.

    Flow-based, lean thinking demands a different focus. The real constraint at portfolio level is not team speed. It is how many initiatives the organisation can meaningfully progress in parallel before bottlenecks, cross-team dependencies, or funding constraints stall progress. This speaks directly to Lean’s core emphasis on optimising the system as a whole, not optimising local team measures. As Deming stressed, managing parts in isolation leads to suboptimisation — the real improvement comes when leadership steps back and improves the flow and constraints at the system level. It is about how efficiently the system moves work across teams, products, and functions, independent of how busy individuals are.

    Tracking individual capacity at portfolio level leads to local optimisation and wastes effort. Managing portfolio-level WIP, cross-team flow, and initiative-level progress gives you real, actionable capacity insight. Trying to map individual team throughput directly to portfolio delivery without addressing cross-initiative coordination, system WIP limits, or systemic blockers is a guaranteed failure.

    Specifically, leaders fall into the trap of believing:

    - That if every team improves throughput, the portfolio improves – false.
    - That we can just sum team metrics to get total portfolio capacity – false.
    - That we can ignore portfolio-level WIP and still forecast accurately – false.

    The shift required is from “how many hours can we extract from people” to “how much value can the system deliver, predictably, given its real constraints.” This is why traditional project management fails at scale. It looks down at tasks and people when it should be looking up at systems and flow.

    ### Category Level (Product / Business Unit)

    At the category level, the biggest mistake is assuming you can simply roll up individual team flow metrics to understand category capacity, without managing cross-team dependencies, shared bottlenecks, or category-level WIP.

    Why is this wrong?

    Teams within a category rarely operate in isolation. They share architectures, platforms, specialists, and decision-makers. Even if each team shows good local flow, the category’s overall delivery can be blocked by cross-team dependencies, shared capacity limits (such as UX, security, or operations), or coordination overhead (like release alignment or integration cycles).

    Traditional thinking assumes category performance equals the sum of teams’ performance. In reality, category performance is governed by the speed of the slowest shared bottleneck and the organisation’s ability to coordinate across flows.

    What needs to shift:

    - Apply category-level WIP limits on how many initiatives or epics are in play across all teams.
    - Focus on improving cross-team flow and dependency management, not just local team throughput.
    - Measure flow across the value stream, not within isolated team swimlanes.

    The mistake is failing to treat the category as an interconnected system. Local team improvements mean little if the category’s delivery is constrained by systemic coordination, shared services, or unmanaged WIP.

    ### Team Level (Execution)

    The core mistake at the team level when moving to flow metrics is assuming that flow metrics like throughput or cycle time are just “better tracking” of individual performance, rather than system-level indicators of work preparation, flow, and blockers.

    Why is this wrong?

    Traditional teams apply flow metrics to individuals, asking: “How many tasks did you finish?” or “What’s your personal throughput or cycle time?” This creates local pressure, gaming, and false signals because flow metrics were never designed to evaluate individuals. They measure how well the team system moves work end-to-end.

    Teams also often skip the upstream preparation work, thinking that flow metrics alone will fix predictability, without addressing key conditions:

    - Right-sizing work
    - Defining clear pull-ready conditions
    - Setting and respecting WIP limits

    What needs to shift:

    - Treat flow metrics as team-level health signals, not personal performance measures.
    - Focus on improving system conditions — work size, WIP, and dependencies — to improve flow, not squeezing people for more.
    - Use metrics to guide improvement conversations, not to monitor or punish individuals.

    The mistake is misapplying flow metrics as individual productivity tools instead of using them to improve team system flow. Without addressing preparation, WIP, and collaboration, adding flow metrics just creates new reporting noise.

    ## What needs to change

    The shift from individual capacity thinking to system-level flow demands disciplined, pragmatic changes across the organisation. This is not a matter of adding a few charts or running reports — it’s a change in ethos. It is about treating capacity as an emergent system property, not a mechanical sum of parts.

    ### Focus on Throughput, Lead Time, and Efficiency

    Rather than fixating on individual or team utilisation, shift your measurement to system-level flow. Pay attention to:

    - The number of items completed per sprint or delivery cycle (noting this assumes work items are similarly sized; otherwise, throughput comparisons can be misleading).
    - The average lead time from work start to completion, helping reveal system bottlenecks and delays.
    - Process cycle efficiency (PCE): the proportion of time work actively moves versus all non–value-adding activities (not just waiting), exposing inefficiencies across the system. This includes unnecessary committees, bureaucratic processes, and other activities that exist only to service themselves rather than delivering value.

    The goal is not to ask, “Who can take on more?” but to ask, “What does our system reliably deliver, and how can we improve flow without overburdening people or teams?”

    ### Stop Estimating, Start Right-Sizing

    Stop wasting time trying to predict perfect effort estimates.

    Instead, apply the Lean principle of reducing variability and batch size, using queuing theory to improve system flow. But be clear: software engineering lives in the complex domain, not the clear or complicated domain where variability can simply be engineered away. We cannot eliminate variability entirely, but we can reduce unnecessary variability by defining a clear definition of workflow, supported by approaches like One Engineering System (1ES) and platform engineering. These strategies help standardise and stabilise the environment, tools, and pipelines — leaving only the unavoidable, context-driven variability that belongs to the real problem space.

    To right-size effectively:

    - Break work into small, similarly sized, meaningful slices that fit smoothly through your system.
    - Focus on cutting work to a shape the system can absorb predictably — not wasting time on abstract story points or inflated complexity debates.
    - Use historical throughput and cycle time data to calibrate what 'small enough' looks like in practice, not in theory.
    - Make right-sizing part of your working agreements and backlog preparation, ensuring teams only pull work that meets clear, shared readiness standards.

    This is not about squeezing people harder; it is about designing a steady, sustainable system where predictability is built directly into the shape and handling of the work.

    ### Apply WIP Limits and Enforce Pull

    Stop treating WIP limits as a mechanical cap or a reportable metric. They are a deliberate, disciplined strategy to protect system flow and predictability. Set clear limits on how many initiatives, epics, or stories are in play — not on how many tasks an individual can juggle. Once the system reaches its limit, stop adding work. Enforce pull: nothing new enters until capacity is truly available. Multitasking is toxic; kill it without hesitation. This is not about pushing people harder; it’s about designing the system so work flows cleanly and teams can focus, finish, and deliver predictably.

    ### Forecast With Empirical Data

    Stop pretending forecasts are about precision. Forecasting is about understanding what the system consistently delivers and using that to set realistic expectations, with the important caveat that this relies on the assumption of a relatively stable system, as Lean approaches depend on system stability for predictability. This also means recognising how system constraints align with legal mandates, statutory requirements, and interdepartmental dependencies — especially in public sector or regulated environments where external obligations shape the boundaries of what can be delivered and when. If your teams typically deliver 6–8 items per sprint, then forecast 6–8 — no sandbagging, no overpromising, no wishful thinking. Use past variance to shape your delivery ranges and confidence levels. Forecasting is not about heroic assumptions; it is about respecting the boundaries of what your system can actually achieve. Teach leadership that predictability comes from protecting system health, not demanding unrealistic outputs or pushing teams beyond sustainable limits.

    ### Monitor Flow Health Holistically

    Flow health is not just a dashboard; it is the living pulse of your system. Go beyond counting throughput and look deeper:

    - Rising cycle or lead times — these are your early-warning signals of hidden bottlenecks creeping into the system (and, as noted earlier, low PCE includes more than just waiting — it also covers other forms of systemic waste and non–value-adding activities).
    - Aging WIP — when work lingers without progress, it is a red flag that something is stalled or blocked.
    - Low PCE — when too much time is spent waiting instead of progressing, it signals waste accumulating across the system.

    These are not vanity metrics. They reveal how your system is truly performing, regardless of how full calendars look or how busy people appear. Build regular inspection of these health indicators into your operating rhythm. Use them not for blame or micromanagement, but as fuel for system-wide conversations: Where is flow breaking down? What needs to change? Where can we intervene to unblock, simplify, or improve?

    Healthy flow is not a side effect; it is a deliberate, ongoing outcome you must design, monitor, and continuously tune.

    The change is not cosmetic — it’s a fundamental rethink of how you approach planning, forecasting, and delivering across all levels of the organisation.

    ### The Role of Leadership

    Leadership is not about control or oversight; it is about creating the conditions where teams and systems can thrive. Lean leadership models humility, removes systemic obstacles, and relentlessly focuses on delivering customer value, not just improving internal measures. Leaders must step back from the temptation to manage individuals and instead take accountability for enabling the system of work. That means:

    - Enabling true autonomy at the team level, giving teams the space to own their work and delivery, without micromanagement.
    - Actively protecting WIP limits and pull discipline across the system, even when external pressures or senior stakeholders demand more.
    - Investing in backlog refinement, right-sizing, and preparation so that teams pull only well-shaped, high-value work — and have the capacity to deliver it predictably.
    - Focusing measurement on system health — time-to-market (TTM), process cycle efficiency (PCE), throughput, and lead time — not individual utilisation, heroics, or busyness.

    Leaders are accountable for creating an environment where flow is deliberate, predictable, and sustainable. This is not about pushing people to work harder; it is about tuning the system so teams can focus, collaborate, and deliver value without unnecessary friction or disruption. True leadership means enabling the system, not extracting from the people.

    ## Reframing the Conversation

    Lean capacity planning reshapes how we think about delivery, focus, predictability, and most critically, continuous learning and relentless improvement — the true core of Lean thinking.

    Stop asking, “How many tasks or hours can we assign?” Start asking, “How much value can the system deliver, at what lead time, and with what efficiency?”

    If you’re not measuring system health indicators like PCE or TTM, you are flying blind.

    This is not about making teams go faster. It is about creating smarter, healthier flow. Get the fundamentals right, and you unlock sustainable, reliable delivery that serves both your customers and your organisation.

    In modern [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) the idea of the topic branch is an essecial one. It is your gatekeeper to preventing Conway's Law and an engineering structure that mirrors your organisational boundaries. Frequent integration through topic branches helps break down silos, encouraging cross-[team collaboration]({{< ref "/tags/team-collaboration" >}}) and reducing the tendency for the software architecture to reflect the organisation's communication paths.

    A topic branch is a short-lived, focused branch in your source control repository that isolates a **single unit of developer work**. This is not a month-long feature branch. This is not "we'll merge it someday" work. A topic branch is something you **code, test, and integrate in a few hours or, at most, a couple of days**.

    The moment your topic branch stretches beyond a few days, take it as a warning:

    - Integration will get harder.
    - Merge conflicts will multiply.
    - Your risk of defects or unintended behaviours will spike.
    - Reviewing and validating costs more

    If you let a branch sit for too long, you are building up **integration debt** that will bite you later. Topic branches, and thinking about them as just that, topics, is an essential practice in modern software engineering.

    ## The Strategic importance of Topic Branches

    We want to consistently emphasised the importance of technical practices that enable flow, adaptability, and resilience in software teams. Whether addressing trunk-based development, [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}), or [engineering excellence]({{< ref "/categories/engineering-excellence" >}}), the message remains the same: discipline in the small enables success in the large. Topic branches fit directly into this pattern. They are not just a coder habit; they are a deliberate tool that reinforces modularity, integration, and continuous feedback, all cornerstones of modern software delivery.

    From a **technical [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}})** perspective, topic branches are pivotal because they enable:

    - Modularity — you isolate changes to a narrow scope.
    - Continuous delivery — you keep the mainline ready for release.
    - Clear code reviews — you limit pull requests to atomic, understandable units.
    - Collaborative accountability — the team shares responsibility for integrating small changes frequently.
    - **Support for agile development practices** — you align technical work with the team’s tactical Sprint Goals and Product Goals.

    Without topic branches, you create a fragile system of work. Without topic branches, you make integration harder. Without topic branches, you **slow down your delivery pipeline** and increase the chance of failure.

    ### Practical Patterns for Tactical Implementation of Topic Branches

    Building on the strategic importance we need actionable patterns that technical leaders and teams can apply. It is not enough to understand why topic branches matter; you need pragmatic, grounded approaches that translate strategy into engineering practice. For most teams and most projects, **GitHub Flow** (the branching model, not the cloud tool) is the most effective model. It is a trunk-based model with minimal overhead and complexity. GitHub Flow treats the main branch as the production-ready line and uses small, short-lived topic branches for all work.

    ![GitHub Flow diagram](images/branchstrategy-trunkbased.png)

    You branch off `main`, do your small unit of work, push frequently, and merge back as soon as possible — ideally the same day, or next day at the latest. Your branch is:

    - Focused on a single task or issue.
    - Continuously tested (locally and via CI).
    - Reintegrated quickly to avoid drift.
    - Reinforces context disapline

    If you have a larger application with more engineers and the need to make changes in the production line, then Microsoft’s Release Flow, which is almost identical to "Github Flow" with the addition of a versioned release branch. One could say that  Release Flow inherits and extends Github Flow.

    ![Release Flow diagram](images/branchstrategy-releaseflow.png)

    Compare this to the traditional **Git Flow** approach that models less mature braching stratagies, which adds layers of feature, develop, release, and hotfix branches. While Git Flow can still be useful in some legacy or non-continuous delivery setups, it introduces far more overhead and complexity. It reflects a strategy from the pre-CD world.

    ![Git Flow diagram](images/branchstrategy-old-school.png)

    Gitflow Flow, and its derivatives, simplifies this: fewer long-lived branches, fewer merge headaches, more emphasis on **incremental delivery**.

    ## Leading change through Branching Stratagy

    If you are leading a team, the presence or absence of disciplined topic branching tells you a lot.

    - Short-lived topic branches = a team practising modularity, integration, continuous feedback, and accountability.
    - Long-lived feature branches = a team accumulating integration risk, delaying delivery, and likely violating agile principles.

    You need to push the team to keep branches small, focused, and short-lived. Review your branching strategy regularly. Make sure it supports, not undermines, your goals of flow, agility, and quality. And above all make sure its clear what each branch is for and how it should be used.

    If your team is struggling with long-lived branches, get serious:

    - Introduce trunk-based development practices with GitHub Flow or Release Flow.
    - Enforce limits on branch lifespan.
    - Tighten your CI/CD loops.
    - Teach your team the cost of integration delay.

    Remember: your branching strategy is not just a technical choice. It is a critical enabler of continuous [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}).

    You can’t deliver quality at speed when your automation is duct-taped together. If your pipelines are stitched across multiple systems, your deployments depend on human rituals, and your tests run in the shadows, you don’t have a delivery system—you have a liability.

    If your automation strategy looks something like this:

    - Manual SQL deployments from someone’s laptop
    - Azure Pipelines building unversioned assemblies
    - Manual deployment to dev and test environments
    - TeamCity rebuilding new unversioned assemblies
    - Octopus Deploy is deploying from Team City to staging and production
    - Selenium tests running on a black-box scripted node that only one person monitors

    You’re not building a product. You’re building chaos. You’re not [scaling]({{< ref "/tags/scaling" >}}) a team. You’re scaling dysfunction.

    ## Fragmentation Is Not an Engineering Strategy

    When every team uses a different deployment tool, stores secrets in a personal vault, and runs tests on unmonitored boxes, you’ve created a system that _no one_ understands and _no one_ can change safely.

    This isn’t flexibility. It’s fragility.

    Fragmentation leads to duplication of effort, inconsistent results, increased cognitive load, and slower delivery. You waste time debugging pipeline differences instead of building product value. And every deviation from a shared system adds risk to quality, security, and compliance.

    [Engineering excellence]({{< ref "/categories/engineering-excellence" >}}) comes from enabling consistency where it matters—creating common foundations that support autonomy without sacrificing reliability. It comes from designing systems that are observable, changeable, and resilient—systems that empower teams through clarity, not confusion.

    This kind of fragmentation also violates the core ethos of [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}): [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}) of value through the union of people, processes, and products. If your toolchain is stitched together by tribal knowledge and Slack messages, you’re not enabling flow. You’re creating friction.

    ## DevOps Is Not Tooling. It's Feedback, Flow, and Learning

    DevOps isn’t a toolkit war. It’s the discipline of enabling feedback, flow, and [continuous learning]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-learning" >}}) across the entire product lifecycle.

    - It’s about **amplifying feedback loops**—build, test, and release systems that surface issues early and often.
    - It’s about **enabling flow**—removing friction between commit and customer, reducing handoffs and rework.
    - It’s about **fostering learning**—capturing telemetry, responding to incidents, and improving from every iteration.

    DevOps without visibility is cargo cult. DevOps across disconnected systems is just automation theatre. And DevOps without learning is just [technical debt]({{< ref "/tags/technical-debt" >}}) in fast-forward.

    ## Building One Engineering System (1ES) through Platform Engineering

    If DevOps is the ethos, then **[Platform Engineering]({{< ref "/tags/platform-engineering" >}})** is the strategy, and **[One Engineering System]({{< ref "/tags/one-engineering-system" >}}) (1ES)** is the execution model.

    Platform Engineering is not just infrastructure automation. It's a practice grounded in DevOps principles that aims to improve every development team's time-to-value, compliance, cost control, and security through **improved developer experiences** and **governed self-service**. It's both a mindset shift and a system of reusable tools and services.

    Platform Engineering teams build and evolve **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**—paved paths that reduce cognitive load, eliminate manual gates, and guide teams safely toward production.

    These platforms:

    - Help developers be self-sufficient (e.g. starter kits, templates, IDE integrations)
    - Encapsulate patterns into reusable services
    - Automate security and compliance checks
    - Streamline operations and infrastructure management

    1ES, pioneered at Microsoft, embodies this by unifying:

    - **[Azure Pipelines]({{< ref "/tags/azure-pipelines" >}})** for end-to-end CI/CD
    - **[Azure Repos]({{< ref "/tags/azure-repos" >}})**, **Boards**, and **Artifacts** as a single source of truth
    - **Infrastructure as Code**, **Policy as Code**, and integrated telemetry

    The result: a secure, observable, scalable system where guardrails are built in and teams can move fast _without creating risk_.

    No handoffs. No tool silos. No black-box deploys. One path from idea to production that every team and every skillset contributes to.

    You may be thinking that "this breaks self-management" and the agency of the teams. But self-management in Agile doesn’t mean chaos. [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Teams don’t self-manage in a vacuum—they operate within the boundaries defined by the organisation. Self-management means giving teams the autonomy to solve problems within a clearly defined system of constraints. That system of constraints—your engineering boundaries, your compliance requirements, your platform capabilities—is your Platform Engineering strategy, and your 1ES is your implementation of that strategy. It defines what good looks like. Those boundaries must be engineered and not left to tribal knowledge. If you want consistent results, define the edges and let the teams operate freely _within_ them.

    ## Consolidate. Standardise. Enable.

    If you want scale, you must design for it. That means:

    - One build system.
    - One deployment path.
    - One way of managing secrets, tests, telemetry, and deployments.

    **Azure Pipelines** is capable of it all. With templates, approvals, gates, agents, deployment groups, and environment strategies, everything you need to build a 1ES-style delivery platform is already there. Yes, there are other tools, but if you are already rooted in the Microsoft stack, then these purpose-built tools fit like a glove.

    Stop spreading your delivery process across half a dozen tools with no visibility. Pick a platform. Make it great. And let your teams focus on product, not plumbing.

    **Engineering excellence isn’t about choosing the coolest tools.**\
    It’s about building a system of work that enables every team to deliver safely, sustainably, and continuously.

    **Stop optimising for familiarity. Start optimising for flow.**

    Human agency is not optional in adaptive systems. It is not something to "blend" with AI or to automate away. It is the only thing that defines strategy, sets purpose, and drives meaningful adaptation. AI has a role, but that role is tactical optimisation within boundaries defined by humans.

    Treating these two forms of agency as equivalent is not just careless; it is dangerous. It leads to brittle systems that optimise yesterday’s decisions while failing to recognise when the game has changed.

    When we talk about **human agency**, we are speaking about **strategic intent** — the setting of direction, the framing of purpose, the shaping of hypotheses, and the stewardship of ethical, political, and systemic choices that no model or algorithm can or should automate. **AI agency**, by contrast, is about **tactical optimisation** — rapid [experimentation]({{< ref "/tags/experimentation" >}}) within bounded parameters, local improvements, efficiency gains, and the relentless pursuit of better tactics without changing the fundamental strategic frame.

    Put simply: AI optimises inside a system. Humans adapt and redefine the system.

    ## Mapping Agency to Adaptive Systems

    In professional practice, I map **human agency** and **AI agency** to different layers of decision-making:

    | Layer              | Human Agency (Strategic Intent)         | AI Agency (Tactical Optimisation)            |
    | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
    | **Purpose**        | Define “why” and “for whom”             | Operate within a defined purpose             |
    | **Adaptation**     | Reframe goals, pivot strategies         | Optimise existing goals and operations       |
    | **Sense-making**   | Interpret signals, detect weak patterns | Surface patterns, recommend actions          |
    | **Accountability** | Own outcomes and systemic impact        | Deliver within parameters; no accountability |

    The strategic layer demands human discernment because it must constantly negotiate ethical trade-offs, respond to uncertainty, and reset direction as new information emerges. Tactical layers benefit from AI’s raw speed, capacity for pattern recognition, and ability to handle enormous volumes of data. There is synergy, but it is not a partnership of equals. Humans govern; AI serves.

    ## The Risks of Overdelegating Adaptation

    Organisations that overdelegate adaptive work to AI systems are not buying efficiency; they are actively sabotaging their future relevance. The risks are not hypothetical; they are immediate and compounding:

    ### 1. Collapse of Strategic Sensing

    Adaptive systems are grounded in weak signal detection, hypothesis-driven exploration, and the willingness to be wrong and change course. AI, by its nature, is trained on existing data distributions and past patterns. It cannot, on its own, identify when the landscape has fundamentally shifted. Blindly optimising yesterday’s patterns only accelerates strategic obsolescence.

    ### 2. Fragility under Complexity

    AI systems operate well under known constraints but become brittle in the face of novel complexity. When the operating environment changes outside the model's training range — as it inevitably will — organisations that have outsourced strategic sensing and adaptation will fail catastrophically and rapidly, long before any dashboard or model warns them.

    ### 3. Erosion of Human Accountability

    When critical adaptive work is offloaded to AI, responsibility becomes diluted. Who is accountable for outcomes? Who owns ethical consequences? If decision-making collapses into model outputs without human interrogation, the result is not augmented intelligence; it is abdicated [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}).

    ## A Pragmatic Approach to Human-AI Collaboration

    To work responsibly with AI in adaptive systems, organisations must operationalise clear agency boundaries:

    - **Humans are accountable for strategic direction, purpose setting, and system definition.**
    - **AI is responsible for tactical optimisations within clear, human-defined parameters.**
    - **Human intervention is mandatory at all escalation points where adaptation is required.**

    This boundary is not a theoretical construct; it should be a live operational discipline embedded into system design, governance practices, and escalation frameworks.

    **Optimisation without adaptation is a recipe for irrelevance.**  
    **Adaptation without optimisation is a recipe for chaos.**  
    **Only through disciplined agency boundaries can we achieve resilient, continuously evolving systems.**

    # Final Thought

    In the rush to automate, organisations must resist the seductive but dangerous myth that AI can replace human agency in complex adaptive environments. **AI optimises, but it does not adapt. It cannot perceive new purpose. It cannot lead. It cannot be held accountable.**

    Strategic intent, adaptive reframing, and ethical stewardship remain irrevocably human domains.

    Those who forget this are not merely inefficient.  
    They are obsolete in the making.

    title: Stop Writing Business Logic in Stored Procedures

  BodyContent: |
    Over the years, I've encountered many companies that have maintained their business logic in stored procedures, but the practice of doing so has died out, for good reasons ill hilight below. However, many codebases have been around for 10+ years, and may still have large amounts of business logic in them.

    If you’re still writing business logic in SQL Stored Procedures, it’s time to stop. If you still have code that stores business login in  SQL Stored Procedures its time to refactor!

    I’m not saying rewrite everything at once. That would be ridiculous. It’s a massive cost with no direct stakeholder value. What I _am_ saying is this:

    > From this point forward, stop creating new business logic in stored procedures.
    >
    > And when you _must_ change one, refactor that logic out into testable, mockable, maintainable code.

    This is not about doing everything at once!

    Take inspiration from the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) team. When they decided to eliminate their suite of brittle, long-running system tests, they didn’t try to replace them in a single sprint. It took them four years of consistent work, in three-week sprints, to fully remove and replace those tests with something better. One step at a time. That’s what change looks like.

    Break the cycle of adding more mess to the mess. Every stored procedure you don't write is a future bug you won't have to debug in production. Every time you choose code over SQL for business logic, you're reclaiming control of your system.

    ## Stored Procedures are the wrong place for Business Logic

    Let’s be clear: this isn’t an abstract architectural debate. The reasons stored procedures are a bad place for business logic are grounded in hard-learned lessons from real teams, real outages, and real maintenance headaches. If you're serious about [engineering excellence]({{< ref "/categories/engineering-excellence" >}}), you need to treat stored procedures as a legacy constraint, not a strategic tool.

    1. **They can’t be tested properly** - You need a full database instance with seed data. You need to run a slow test harness. There’s no mocking, no fast feedback, no isolation. If it can’t be unit tested, it can’t be trusted. Long-running system tests do not tell you if the code works, only that the long-running system tests that you created work.
    2. **They don’t participate in CI/CD** - Stored procedures are almost always deployed manually or via fragile SQL scripts. While it can be automated by things like Redgate, it's often still brittle, breaks reproducibility, and blocks automated pipelines.
    3. **They aren’t version-controlled like real code** - While you can have them under source control, they are "copied" into source control..**.** either by Readgate or manually by a developer. Manual tasks are risky! Remember the Knight Capital Group!
    4. **They tightly couple your logic to the database** - That kills portability and locks you into a specific database engine. It also makes testing, debugging, and observability painful. There have been attempts in the past to create "Unit Tests" for stored procedures, but they have largely been abandoned in favour of just getting our logic out of that scenario.
    5. **They don’t scale** - Stored procedures run on the most expensive, least scalable part of your infrastructure: the database server. Business logic belongs in services that can scale out.
    6. **They violate the separation of concerns** - Your database should store and retrieve data. Your application should handle logic. Stored procedures blur that line and create a big ball of mud.
    7. **They’re hard to reason about** - No dependency injection. No composition. No mocking. No telemetry. No proper logging. Just deeply procedural code with limited tooling support. If you have to rely on a debugger to see if your code works, you are doing it wrong.

    Before you write the next line of business logic in a stored procedure, ask yourself: is this something I want to debug at 2am with no tests, no telemetry, and no rollback plan?

    That’s the reality of stored procedures. They make every part of your engineering practice harder. Get the logic out. Put it where it belongs—alongside the rest of your tested, observable, maintainable code.

    ## The strategy: don’t rip, refactor

    You don’t need permission to start this. You don’t need a project. You just need a commitment to modern engineering discipline:

    - When you build new features, do it in application code, not SQL.
    - When you touch an existing stored procedure, _refactor it_. Move the logic into testable code.
    - Leave a thin wrapper if necessary, but relocate the behaviour.

    This is a _pay-as-you-go_ modernisation strategy. It lets you progressively reduce [technical debt]({{< ref "/tags/technical-debt" >}}) without halting delivery.

    ## The benefits are compounding.

    Every time you refactor, you:

    - Increase the ability to create unit tests
    - Improve maintainability
    - Enable faster feedback loops
    - Reduce runtime costs
    - Shrink the surface area for bugs
    - Move toward [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}})

    No single change flips the system. But every change you make is a step away from the fragile procedural past and toward a sustainable engineering future.

    ## The outcome?

    This isn’t about dogma. It’s about discipline. Modern [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) demands testability, traceability, observability, and scalability. Stored procedures give you none of that.

    If you're maintaining logic in stored procedures, you're fighting your tooling, your pipeline, and your team. Stop doing that.

    Start small. Move incrementally. Raise the bar.

    Modern software is built in code, not SQL.

    [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) is not automation. It is not pipelines. It is not "shifting left" while locking decision-making into ancient [release management]({{< ref "/tags/release-management" >}}) bureaucracies.  
    **DevOps is agency.** It is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.

    If your developers do not have operational agency—control over environments, deployments, telemetry, and remediation—you are not doing DevOps.  
    You are automating fragility.

    ## There Is No Place Like Production

    We have already established that [production is the only place real feedback happens]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2020/2020-12-28-there-is-no-place-like-production" >}}). UAT, staging, demo environments—none of these reveal how real users behave, where real bottlenecks emerge, or where real pain points lie.  
    Real outcomes, real telemetry, and real consequences only happen in production.

    If developers do not have operational authority over production, they are blindfolded. They can build, but they cannot learn. They can deploy, but they cannot observe. They can script, but they cannot improve.

    **Without production feedback, [Continuous Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}) collapses into Continuous Guessing.**

    ## Automation without Agency is Fragile

    Most so-called "DevOps transformations" fail because they stop at tooling. They build beautiful pipelines that developers cannot influence. They deploy artifacts that developers cannot monitor.  
    And when something goes wrong? They are forced to raise a ticket to an ops team who barely understands the context of the change.

    This is organisational malpractice.

    Automation is not enough.  
    Pipelines must be _developer-controlled_.  
    Environments must be _developer-managed_.  
    Telemetry must be _developer-owned_.

    If your developers are second-class citizens in your own delivery ecosystem, you are manufacturing helplessness at scale.

    ## Operational Agency Is Non-Negotiable

    True DevOps demands that developers have operational agency, including:

    - **Deploy to production anytime** – without raising a ticket, without scheduling a "release train," without begging for a window.
    - **Own telemetry** – define, collect, and act on usage, performance, and error data directly from production.
    - **Roll back or forward** – respond to incidents with speed and autonomy, without waiting on a change advisory board.
    - **Observe and adapt** – monitor real user behaviour and adapt deployments and [product strategy]({{< ref "/tags/product-strategy" >}}) based on live signals.

    This level of ownership must also be reflected in your [Definition of Done]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2025/2025-03-17-your-evolving-definition-of-done" >}}), ensuring that telemetry and operational readiness are part of what it means for work to be complete.

    Agency without feedback is noise.  
    Feedback without agency is paralysis.  
    **You must have both.**

    ## DevOps Without Operational Agency Is Dead on Arrival

    Every time you separate developers from operational decision-making, you break the feedback loop. You turn "continuous" delivery into ceremonial delivery.  
    You [destroy agility]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2021/2021-04-19-stop-normalizing-unprofessional-behaviour-in-the-name-of-agility" >}}). You disempower your people. You institutionalise blame instead of learning.

    If you want real DevOps, you must give developers real control.

    Yes, this requires real trust.  
    Yes, this demands real engineering maturity.  
    Yes, this will expose the weaknesses you have been hiding behind process theatre.

    But the alternative is worse: a hollow shell of DevOps, where the only thing "continuous" is your excuses for why it still takes six months to learn whether your features work.

    Resilience is not a nice-to-have. It is not a department. It is not something you bolt on later if you get around to it. Resilience is part of the product. If you are serious about delivering value, you design resilience deliberately from day one. Any other approach is just gambling with your business, and is adding to your [technical debt]({{< ref "/tags/technical-debt" >}}).

    Real resilience is not about having good people with pagers. It is not about heroes. Heroes emerge when systems lack resilience. They hoard work, avoid [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}), and justify cutting corners by claiming they are "doing whatever it takes." In reality, they introduce silent risks, undermine teamwork, and erode quality standards.

    If your resilience depends on a hero, you are not resilient. You are vulnerable and you just have not been exposed yet.

    ## Resilience is a Core Feature

    Resilience must be treated like any other core feature. It must be designed, built, and continuously improved. It must be part of your product definition, your architecture, and your engineering culture. It must be owned by the same people who build the product. At Microsoft, the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) engineering teams did exactly that, they built resilience which was engineered into every layer of their system — not handed off to a separate Ops team, not left to wishful thinking. Engineers owned their live site experience end-to-end form _ideation_ to _validation_ and all of the _design_, _build_, _test_, _release_ and _run_ in between.

    Incidents were expected, contained, and learned from, not blamed on individuals. They did not hope for resilience. They built it.

    If they did have an incident, they would own it, not just fix the problem and sweep it under the rug.

    ## Build for Containment, Not Perfection

    Every serious product needs resilience capabilities: telemetry, rapid roll-forward, observability, and risk containment.

    Without telemetry, you cannot see what is happening. Without rapid roll-forward, you cannot respond fast enough. Without observability, you cannot understand why things are happening. Without risk containment, small failures turn into major outages.  
    If you have to shut down your entire platform to fix one feature, you have already failed.

    Microsoft’s teams built telemetry into everything. They measured customer experience directly — failed or slow user minutes — not just server uptime. They tuned alerts to detect real-world impact. They used safe deployment rings with deliberate bake times to catch problems early. They separated deployment from exposure using feature flags, and stopped cascading failures with circuit breakers and throttling.

    Failures were not exceptional. Failures were normal.  
    Resilience was not improvised. It was engineered.

    ## Treat Resilience as a First-Class Investment

    Resilience is not free, but the cost of neglecting it is far higher. Downtime kills customer trust. Outages cost revenue. Slow recovery wrecks morale. Ignoring resilience is gambling with your business.

    Treat resilience like a feature. Design it. Engineer it. Continuously improve it. Put it in your [Definition of Done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}}). Make it part of every code review, every architecture discussion, every release decision. If you are not actively designing for resilience, you are designing for fragility whether you mean to or not.

    Build for failure. Measure resilience empirically. Improve relentlessly.

    ## Pragmatic Steps to Build Resilience

    You do not need permission to start. You do not need to fix everything at once. You just need to move with intent:

    - Instrument everything. If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it.
    - Make every change reversible or overridable. Progressive delivery, feature flags, and automated deployments are minimum standards.
    - Build for isolation. Cells, circuit breakers, and throttling prevent one failure from taking down the system.
    - Treat incidents as system signals, not team failures. Every incident is feedback for your product and your organisation.

    ## Failure is Inevitable. Your Response is Optional.

    You will never eliminate failure. That is not the goal.  
    The goal is to ensure that failures are small, contained, quickly detected, and rapidly recovered without compromising your product or your business.

    If you want resilience, build it deliberately. Make it part of your product. Treat it with the same seriousness as security, scalability, and usability. Anything less is just gambling that the next crisis will not be the one that takes you down.

    **Resilience is not heroism. Resilience is system design.**  
    Own it as you would any other critical feature. Because it is one.

    Most agile transformations fail not because they get the ceremonies wrong, but because they misunderstand the real point: **cultivating agency** in people and systems.

    You can install all the stand-ups, backlogs, retrospectives, and planning sessions you want. Without genuine agency, you're not transforming. You're decorating.

    **[Agentic Agility]({{< ref "/tags/agentic-agility" >}})** is the bridge between _doing Agile_ and _being agile_. It reconnects the mechanical adoption of frameworks with the deeper need for autonomy, purpose, and empirical adaptability. Without agency, agility remains performative theatre. With agency, it becomes adaptive strength.

    ## Hollow Transformations vs. Human and System Agency

    Most transformations stall because they focus on ceremonial compliance:

    - Stand-ups happen daily
    - Stories are "written"
    - Retrospectives are "held"
    - Boards are "managed"

    Meanwhile, decision latency remains high, impediments are tolerated, and delivery remains brittle. The system stays paralysed by learned helplessness.

    Transformation is about a shift in **beliefs and constraints**, not just behaviours:

    - Individuals must believe they can shape outcomes.
    - Teams must be enabled to change how they work.
    - Organisations must evolve policies, structures, and practices that block responsiveness.

    This is the ethos behind Agentic Agility: fostering **human agency** (the ability to act with intention) and **system agency** (the capacity for the system itself to adapt).

    When we focus transformation efforts solely on compliance and ceremony, we institutionalise fragility. When we focus on agency, we unleash resilience.

    ## Agentic Agility and Evidence-Based Management

    You cannot manage what you cannot measure. You cannot empower what you cannot observe.

    This is why I have consistently pointed to [Evidence-Based Management (EBM)]({{< ref "/resources/guides/evidence-based-management-guide-2020" >}})as a cornerstone for real change. EBM gives organisations the tools to:

    - **Measure actual outcomes**, not outputs.
    - **Challenge assumptions** with data, not dogma.
    - **Adapt strategies** based on evidence, not inertia.

    Without an evidence-based feedback loop, agency collapses into chaos or bureaucratic decay. EBM operationalises Agentic Agility by aligning action with impact.

    Transformations without agency are short-lived.
    Transformations without evidence are blind.
    Transformations with neither are inevitable failures.

    ## Real Agility is Agentic Agility

    Agentic Agility reframes transformation away from ceremonies and towards capacity:

    - Capacity for individuals to act intentionally.
    - Capacity for teams to shape their working systems.
    - Capacity for organisations to evolve dynamically in response to reality.

    The next evolution of agility will not be led by those who install more frameworks. It will be led by those who build organisations capable of thinking, learning, and acting for themselves.

    **Agentic Agility is not an option. It is the missing lever for real change.**

    Business resilience is not an accident. It is the deliberate outcome of intelligent systems design, pragmatic decision-making, and organisational discipline. If you want resilience, you must build for it—**upfront, consistently, and aggressively**.

    Here is a pragmatic checklist for engineering true business resilience and continuity:

    ## Observability and Telemetry First

    You cannot manage what you cannot see. You cannot fix what you cannot detect.

    - **Embed telemetry at every level**: application, infrastructure, business processes.
    - **Define service level objectives (SLOs)** for your critical systems and actually measure against them.
    - **Monitor leading indicators**, not just trailing failures.
    - **Establish a live site culture**, not a "we’ll find out when customers call" culture.

    If your systems are invisible until they explode, you are not resilient; you are negligent.

    ## Decouple Systems Aggressively

    Coupling is a time bomb. When one piece falls, everything else falls with it.

    - **Bounded contexts** are non-negotiable. Embrace them.
    - **No logic in the data tier.** Databases store data, not behaviour. If your business rules are locked in SQL, you are one outage away from a complete operational collapse.
    - **Avoid shared databases**. Duplicate data if necessary. Loose coupling beats data purity.
    - **Prefer asynchronous messaging**. Synchronous systems are brittle under load and fail catastrophically.

    Resilience comes from isolation. Systems must fail independently, not cascade like dominoes.

    ### When the User Profile Service takes out the entire system

    For a long time I have worked with the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) teams at Microsoft as an strategic customer and MVP and I have witnessed this lesson firsthand. One of the major outages of [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) was triggered by something that, at first glance, seemed trivial: the Profile Service. When the Profile Service went down, developers could no longer commit code, and product owners could not update backlog items. Why? Because the system could not resolve your friendly name from your authenticated ID.

    The service was so tightly coupled into critical user flows that its failure crippled the entire platform.

    In response, the teams created "live site incident" repair work and moved the Profile Service behind a **circuit breaker**. If the Profile Service went down again, it would degrade gracefully, not drag down the entire experience.

    As an anecdotal aside, a few months later another unrelated service failed, and—unsurprisingly—it also took down large parts of the system. That was the final straw. The teams went on a full-scale mission to introduce the **circuit breaker pattern** across **every service**, making sure no single point of failure could collapse the platform again.

    Decoupling and graceful degradation are not academic exercises. They are mandatory if you value continuity.

    ## Treat Deployments as Routine, Not Special

    Every deployment is a practice run for disaster recovery. If deployment is a risky, complex, orchestrated event, you have already failed.

    - **Implement [Continuous Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}) (CD)** so that deployments happen safely, frequently, and predictably.
    - **Use feature toggles** to separate code deployment from feature release.
    - **Automate rollbacks**. A failed deployment should not require heroics.

    If your organisation fears deployment day, it is structurally fragile.

    ## Empower Teams to Act Without Hierarchy Paralysis

    In a crisis, the last thing you want is a command-and-control bottleneck. Empowerment is a precondition to survival.

    - **Pre-delegate authority** for critical systems response.
    - **Train teams** on incident management procedures, disaster recovery, and failover operations.
    - **Decentralise decision-making** to the people closest to the work.

    In crisis, minutes matter. Top-down control costs lives and revenue.

    ## Assume Everything Will Fail; Design to Recover Fast

    Hope is not a strategy. Failure is inevitable. Recovery speed determines survival.

    - **Chaos engineering** is not optional; it is responsible practice.
    - **Design for graceful degradation**. Partial failure is better than total failure.
    - **Practice recovery drills**. Don't just have a DR plan; rehearse it until it is boring.

    If you are not recovering faster than your competitors, you are losing.

    ## DevOps, [Site Reliability Engineering]({{< ref "/tags/site-reliability-engineering" >}}), and Evidence-Based Management

    Business resilience is **DevOps in action**: the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to end users. Resilient systems emerge from the daily discipline of CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and monitoring as first-class citizens.

    It is **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** lived, not aspirational. SRE teaches us that availability, latency, performance, efficiency, [change management]({{< ref "/tags/change-management" >}}), monitoring, and emergency response are all product features—just as important as the user-facing ones.

    It is **Evidence-Based Management (EBM)** made real. Metrics like Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), [Deployment Frequency]({{< ref "/tags/deployment-frequency" >}}), and [Customer Satisfaction]({{< ref "/tags/customer-satisfaction" >}}) are not vanity measures; they are survival metrics. They inform whether your investment in resilience is paying off or just theatre.

    Resilience is not a project. It is an ethos. You must architect it into your systems, invest in it continuously, and operationalise it ruthlessly.

    Otherwise, you are gambling with your business and calling it strategy.

    The future is not about humans fighting to keep soul-crushing work. It is about letting go of the roles we invented to dehumanise ourselves.

    We created jobs like scanning groceries, cleaning toilets, packing boxes, and driving taxis not because they were noble pursuits, but because we needed to systematise output. We shaped them at the height of industrialisation under the false assumption that most people were incapable of thinking critically or creatively. That assumption was, and remains, wrong.

    Humans harnessed fire, developed tools, built cities, and explored space. Yet we still have people herded into checkout lanes scanning barcodes for £10 an hour because we have convinced ourselves that’s all they can do. This is not dignity. It is systemic failure.

    **Robots** started the change by replacing physical repetition. **AI** is accelerating it by replacing cognitive repetition. Neither are threats to humanity. They are threats to the systems that tried to industrialise it.

    ## Scientific Management: A Philosophy of Subjugation

    Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Management—better known as Taylorism—was never about human potential. It was about control and compliance. It engineered mediocrity, not mastery.

    - **Task and Bonus Systems**: Set quotas just above sustainable capacity. Underpay unless "targets" are hit. Replace pride in craftsmanship with fear of poverty.
    - **Departments and Specialisation**: Teach people one sliver of a process. Reduce communication. Stifle systemic understanding. "Efficient," yes. Humane, absolutely not.

    - **Job Titles as Status Symbols**: Create hierarchies not based on contribution or value, but on titles and politics. Reward political manipulation over problem-solving.

    These patterns are not relics of history. They are alive and well in most organisations today. Hierarchies still prioritise power over outcomes. Standardisation still trumps collaboration. Fear still motivates more than trust.

    We industrialised people because it made them easier to control. Now, automation and AI are finally taking those shackles off.

    ## The Knowledge Age Demands Heads That Count

    In a knowledge economy, compliance is worthless. We do not need more human robots performing repeatable tasks. We need humans solving problems, thinking critically, and delivering outcomes.

    The organisations that thrive are the ones that realise this. They pay people enough that food and shelter are no longer their motivators (re Daniel Pink). They create environments where autonomy, mastery, and purpose are what drive performance—not carrot-and-stick bonus schemes.

    If your workforce needs extrinsic rewards to perform, you have already failed them.

    ## If You Are Still Paying Bonuses, You Are Still in the Industrial Age

    Organisations still running bonus schemes, still obsessed with job titles, and still measuring success by output rather than outcome are clinging desperately to an age that is already automated away.

    You are not preparing for the future. You are delaying your own obsolescence.

    The simple truth:

    **Change your company, or change your company.**

    The knowledge age is here. It is not waiting for your permission.

    ## AI: The Next Step Towards Restoring Humanity at Work

    AI is not replacing humans. It is replacing the work that never deserved a human in the first place.

    Writing repetitive reports. Copying data between systems. Processing endless low-value approvals. AI is the natural continuation of automation, taking rote cognitive tasks off our plates the same way robots took rote physical tasks out of our hands.

    This is not a threat. It is a liberation.

    Every time AI replaces another mechanical task, it creates space for something better: creativity, strategy, empathy, innovation.

    It gives us the opportunity to do work that demands distinctly human qualities—qualities that no machine can replicate.

    If your organisation sees AI as a threat to its workforce, it is a sign you have industrialised your people. If you see AI as a tool for elevating humanity, you are building for the future.

    Robots freed our hands. AI is freeing our minds.

    The only real question is: **Are you ready to stop treating people like machines?**

    Most systems are not resilient. They are fragile by design—propped up by a fantasy of "continuity" that vanishes the moment real pressure hits.

    Spain’s national blackout. Portugal’s cascading failures. Oracle’s hospital cloud outage. Heathrow’s catastrophic shutdown. These were not accidents. They were not rare, unpredictable events. They were the inevitable consequences of bad engineering, shallow product thinking, and organisational self-delusion.

    Resilience is not a checkbox. It is not a compliance exercise. It is not a hope and a prayer filed away in a disaster recovery plan. Resilience is hard. It is costly. It must be engineered, tested, and verified under real-world conditions—or it does not exist.

    ## Bad Engineering

    Real resilience assumes things will fail. Networks will fail. Authentication systems will fail. People will make mistakes. If your architecture does not _assume failure_ at every level, you are not resilient; you are brittle.

    Spain’s energy grid collapsed because it was optimised for efficiency, not survivability. No dynamic rerouting. No true load isolation. No meaningful observability. Their system was designed for perfect operating conditions that do not exist outside PowerPoint decks.

    Oracle’s outage was even worse. Critical healthcare systems went offline because Oracle’s cloud infrastructure had no effective multi-region failover. Their architecture did not degrade gracefully; it fell over completely. That is not resilience. That is negligence at scale.

    ## Bad Product and Continuity Thinking

    Resilience is a **product capability**. If your product cannot survive failure, it is not a product. It is a liability.

    Spain, Portugal, Oracle—all treated continuity as an afterthought. As long as the lights were on today, everything was declared fine. Until it was not.

    Real product [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) demands harder questions: _When—not if—this part fails, how will our system recover? How will our customers experience it? How fast can we restore service? How much risk are we carrying—and is that risk acceptable?_

    If those questions are not part of your roadmap, your architecture, and your operational strategy, you are not building resilience. You are building a house of cards.

    ## Organisational Blindness

    The real failure sits higher up the chain. Leadership failed to create a culture that prioritised operational survivability over operational fantasy.

    I have lived through this firsthand. At Merrill Lynch, I participated in two major disaster recovery exercises. Both were declared “successful.” Both were complete failures.

    Not a single system restored was actually usable. Systems were technically “back online”—but functionally, nothing worked. And the root cause was obvious: Active Directory, the system everything depended on for authentication, was never successfully recovered. Without it, every other "restored" system was dead weight.

    Ironically, my application was successfully restored. We assumed it would have been usable—_if_ Active Directory had been available. But we never found out. Two years running, the same critical dependency remained broken, and nobody was willing to call it what it was: systemic failure hidden behind fake success metrics.

    Heathrow Airport offers another textbook case of organisational blindness disguised as resilience. When a fire broke out at one of their substations, they publicly blamed the disruption on their third-party power supplier. What they failed to mention was critical: Heathrow receives power from _three independent substations_, any one of which can fully power the airport alone.

    The real problem was not the power supply it was a fluctuation in the power supply. It was Heathrow’s own disaster recovery system, designed to “protect” infrastructure by shutting everything down that detected that fluctuation and activated.  
    The result? Heathrow’s entire IT backbone collapsed. It took the rest of the day to get basic systems running again—and much longer to recover from the cascading operational chaos.

    Instead of owning the internal failure, leadership pointed fingers outward. It is the same story everywhere: an unwillingness to face the reality that their own fake resilience made the disaster worse.

    ## Real Resilience: Iterating Over the Pain

    Not every story ends in failure. There are organisations that do it right—and the difference is discipline.

    Take Rackspace. During catastrophic floods in London, when almost every other datacentre in the city failed, Rackspace’s facility stayed operational. Their backup generators worked exactly as expected. While others blamed suppliers and scrambled for excuses, Rackspace quietly kept their customers online.

    When asked why their systems worked when everyone else’s failed, the CEO simply held up a key.

    It was the key to the power room.

    Every month, without fail, he would walk down, unlock the main breaker, and physically pull it—shutting off external power. Not in theory. Not in a simulation. A real, full transfer to emergency backup power under real-world conditions.

    Because of that brutal discipline, they did not hope their disaster recovery systems would work. They _knew_. They had tested it, again and again, under real conditions. They iterated over the pain.

    And that is the lesson:  
    If something is hard, you must do it _more often_, not less.  
    If failure is painful, you must _lean into it_, not avoid it.

    Only by living through controlled, intentional failures—early, often, and brutally—can you build true resilience.

    You cannot wait until it matters. You cannot prepare only on paper. You must _earn_ resilience by testing your systems, exposing your weaknesses, and getting punched in the face repeatedly until you are strong enough to survive the real thing.

    ## Resilience Is Built, Not Bought

    You cannot buy resilience from a vendor. You cannot inherit it automatically because you deployed to "the cloud." You cannot declare yourself resilient by writing it into your incident response plan.

    Real resilience is built. It is designed in. It is iterated over. It is relentlessly tested. It is painful, slow, and expensive. But the alternative—the fragility we saw in Spain, Portugal, Oracle, and Heathrow—is far more costly.

    If you are not engineering for failure, you are engineering for collapse.

    Fragility is not an accident. It is a design choice.  
    Pretending otherwise only guarantees you will learn the hard way.
