One of my customers is hiring for the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master Role and asked if I had a handy-dandy [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) Job Spec that they could use. I did not, but there have been a few good ones floating around in the ether so I thought that pulling one together would be a good idea anyway. Here is my best effort to use the existing job postings, and combine them with the latest version of the Scrum Guide.

## Hiring a Professional Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is a challenging position to hire for and finding the right person is even more difficult. Ultimately the Scrum Master is accountable for the effectiveness of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}). That means that they need to have some level of knowledge of both the relevant business domain to help the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), as well as enough technical knowledge to help the Scrum Team.

- [Are technical skills required to be a Scrum Master?]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2019/2019-09-01-are-technical-skills-required-to-be-a-scrum-master" >}})

While there is no need for a Scrum Master to be technical, they do need to understand what effective looks like within the product and the technical domain within which you are creating the product. Ultimately it's worth remembering that certification is not an indication of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}), but may be used as a simple bar to reduce the load on interviews and assert a minimum level of knowledge. At $200 for a PSM I assessment and $250 for the PSM II assessment, and with a reputation in the industry of not being totally easy, these are a no-brainer for any aspiring or experienced Scrum Master. At the time of writing there are more than [350k people with PSM I and 11k people with PSM II](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/count).
