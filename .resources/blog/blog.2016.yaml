    I have been honoured by being asked to speak at [Agile in Africa](http://agileinafrica.com/) today on the topic of [Kalabule or a Professional at Agile in Africa](http://agileinafrica.com/speaker/martin-hinshelwood/). I was a little disappointed when Nana asked me, as I had already booked a customer on those dates in Houston, Texas. Nana asked if I could do remote, so I could attend anyway :). This is my second presentation at Agile In Africa, and it sounds like this years event is just as awesome as the last.

    **Download the Presentation:** [**Kalabule or Professional @ Agile In Africa**](https://doc.co/C7HRwP)

    I have been covering the topic of Professionalism in software ever since I started doing the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) thing and finding that most companies, big and small, really have no idea what Scrum is beyond doing "Stand Ups" and "Demos"… neither of which are really part of Scrum…

    [![clip_image001](images/clip_image001_thumb-1-1.png "clip_image001")](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clip_image001-2-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Most teams working on software are kalabule (cowboys) who use excuses of poor management to try to seek forgiveness for their terrible software. Software that more often than not does not do what the customer asked for, was not delivered when they needed it, and cost far more than what they were expecting. That, my friends, is the experience of working with kalabule and con men…not professionals. The customers of these teams need to demand professionalism from the teams and vendors with the result being [working software]({{< ref "/tags/working-software" >}}) delivered on a regular cadence that meets their needs.

    There is no excuse any more for kalabule. None…

    [![clip_image001[4]](images/clip_image0014_thumb-3-3.png "clip_image001[4]")](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clip_image0014.png)
    { .post-img }

    Its was the last session in the day so I was expecting only a few people, but it looks like there was some turnout. Nana introduced the audience and I had Bankers, Farmers, and Software folks in the room. A good mix of Customers and Providers is always good when your message affects them both.

    [![clip_image001[6]](images/clip_image0016_thumb-4-4.png "clip_image001[6]")](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clip_image0016.png)
    { .post-img }

    I talked a lot about why we are kalabule in the software industry and that neither mechanical Scrum, nor mere [Engineering Practices]({{< ref "/tags/engineering-practices" >}}) alone can prevent the fear, disrespect, hidden rocks, and overall lack of commitment in the software industry. We also need some guiding values that we can use to make sure that we always do the right thing.

    - Courage
    - Focus
    - Commitment
    - Respect
    - Openness

    If these values are not something that you want, not just building software, but simply interacting with others on a daily bases, then you have no business interacting with them.

    As an industry we need to step up and refuse to be kalabule (cowboys) and instead strive to be Professionals and embody the Values that we want to be known for. Its time to clean the unprofessional muck from our industry and reinvent ourselves…

    I have been working with a number of customers in the last year that want to move to VSTS. While many of them want to do the full Collection import, many do not.

    [![image](images/image_thumb-1-1.png "image")](https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image.png)
    { .post-img }

    Maybe they have too many Team Projects and they want to consolidate, maybe they just have too much baggage. Whatever the reason I needed to be able to push data around between TFS and VSTS… or even TFS to TFS. That is when the [VSTS Sync Migration tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.vsts-sync-migration) were born.

    I initially had but a single goal of migrating work items, but since then it has broadened out to include many different types of data:

    - **Work Items** - I only ever worry about the Tip of Work Item tracking. Apart from the History (comments) field which I do migrate there is really no long term value in it aside from reporting. Since most migration tool mess up the dates the reporting value disappears as does the value in the history.
      Note: I do have some ideas around this and the new API capabilities since TFS 2012 should allow a higher fidelity of data migration, however I have not yet been unable to talk a customer out of History, and thus I have not had the need to build. So if you want to migrate with history and have the budget…
    - **Test Plans & Suits** - The Test data is a lot trickier, but I managed to get Configurations, Variables, as well as Plans and Suits migrated. There are still some bugs but its way better than having to go make everything from scratch.
      Note: Test Runs are not currently migrated but I have been noodling on that problem. Again, once someone is desperate enough to give me a reason to go dive in…
    - **Teams** \- Really simple, just the team names, but there is scope for a lot more.
    - Area & Iteration Paths - Simply replicated the existing layout. I would love to have all of the Team Meta data but again, time…

    Since most teams migrate from TFVC to Git in TFS I was not interested in migrating code. There are some really good solutions for that already with Git-TF and Git-TFS being the best. I wanted the tools to be free as well, so while I always work in VSTS I publish the code and releases out to [GitHub]({{< ref "/tags/github" >}}) so others can participate.

    You are welcome to Fork the repository on GitHub and I will happily accept pull requests, but know that my MASTER is in VSTS and not GitHub along with the entire automated build and release system. I release to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VSTS.DataBulkEditor.Engine/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator), [GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migration), and the [VSTS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.vsts-sync-migration).

    Let me know what you think of the tools…

    Last week I was teaching a Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Foundations in Farnborough and I had to make sure that I got a hotel with awesome internet access. As well as teaching the class I Have two additional tasks for the week. The first was to have the honour of talking on ScrumPulse, Scrum.org's webcast, and the second was to talk at the prestigious Dutch ALM Meetup.

    Both topics were the same with "[Scaling]({{< ref "/tags/scaling" >}}) [Professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) with Visual Studio Team Services" but the interactivity and available time was substantially different with only really 45 minutes in the webcast and nearly 3 hours for the workshop.

    ## Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services Webcast

    Tools don't solve problems, but they can help reduce the friction of Scaling Professional Scrum. The only way to successfully scale across multiple teams, maybe in multiple countries, is to create robust automation and orchestration for minimizing the risks, and time, of manual tasks. Visual Studio Team Services allows you to create a robust, platform agnostic, support structure that can start where you are, and grow as your needs mature. One [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}), One Nexus, or many...

    See how it grows...

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o8YuisXZzc&w=768&h=432

    You can also view the [slides](http://nkdagility.net/SPSwithVSTS) from docs.com

    _Before viewing the webcast please make sure that you have familiarised yourself with the [Nexus Guide](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/The-Nexus-Guide). I did not have time to go through the entire process and focused instead on how you might implement a single Nexus in VSTS with suggestions on how to implement many Nexus._

    Although there were over 800 registrations for the event the meeting software only supported 100 participants. If you were signed up and were unable to attend then you can view the recording. Scrum.org is looking at options to support the larger number of participants in the future.

    The event was recorded, and has been published as "[Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o8YuisXZzc)" on the Scrum.org YouTube channel. We also have [published the slides](https://doc.co/LPzMBT) for you as well.

    ## Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services Workshop

    Find out how to organize many teams of work in VSTS within a Nexus (3-9 teams) and control what data is shown to who. Martin will introduce Nexus as a compliment to Scrum and demonstrate how to setup VSTS to support it, then let you get your hands dirty…

    This time no other than Martin Hinshelwood will join us for an interesting evening around Scrum for Team of Teams. Martin is an independent consultant at nkdAgility ([https://nkdagility.com/](https://nkdagility.com/)) and runs his own business at customers all over the world.

    - **Slides**: [http://nkdagility.net/dutch-alm-nexus](http://nkdagility.net/dutch-alm-nexus)
    - **Meeting**: [http://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Microsoft-ALM-Group/events/228588973/](http://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Microsoft-ALM-Group/events/228588973/) This was done as an interactive 3 hour workshop with live hands on with Team Services. As this meeting was live only I can only refer you to the webcast above. However if you want me to come and do this workshop at your User Group then please let me know.

    ## Conclusion

    While there are many tools out there to support Scrum only Visual Studio Team Services really support scaling scrum to the enterprise. If you have many teams working together on a single product then there is no better tool at scale than Visual Studio Team Services.

    Get in touch if you want me to speak at a User Group, if [I am going to be in your area](https://nkdagility.com/company/about-martin-hinshelwood/) then let me know!

    I have had quite a few requests from folks that want to use the full capabilities of VSTS or TFS but really need to have the code published in [Github]({{< ref "/tags/github" >}}) as it is Open-Source. Well I build a few Open-Source projects and I want to have my cake and eat it too.. I want to be able to use the full power of VSTS to reduce the friction of doing Agility and [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), but I want to publish the code and output to Github for public consumption. As Github really is the only place to store OSS software we need to figure out how to handle that.

    UPDATE: David Corban suggested some edits around controlling the movement of code rather than just automatic. I added a Configuration Options secion...

    And since Github gives us unlimited Public repos and VSTS gives us unlimited Private repositories it's almost a perfect match. VSTS provides a much better holistic end-to-end solution and Github provides public access.

    I mainly want to sync the MASTER branches between VSTS and Github, but I might also want to specify a single branch that is synced. Solving this problem is relatively easy and I have documented it below. All we need is two automated builds in VSTS that sync the code. One triggered when a change is made in VSTS, and the other when a change is made in Github.

    ## Possible applications and configuration options

    Based on some feedback for this post on different scenarios I though I should spell them out.

    - **Synchronisation between VSTS and Github** - This is my main focus here and if you follow the post you will get full synchronisation
    - **Manual Synchronisation** - If you turn off the CI you can choose when you synchronise
    - **Selective Synchronisation** - You may want to have a VSTS topic branch synchronised with your GitHub MASTER. You can then Work in VSTS and choose when you publish to GitHub by merging to the Topic Branch. I probably would favour protecting both VSTS and GitHub MASTER and enabling a bypass for the synchronisation account. Then I can use Pull request to get into MASTER on either side which would result in a synchronisation.

    If you have other scenarios that yo would like to support then feel free to comment and we can figure them out.

    ## Automated Push from VSTS to Github

    If we were to look at the commands that we need to do then then it is fairly simple. We need to first PULL from Github's MASTER and then PUSH from VSTS to that Master.

    ```
    Git pull https://github.com/nkdAgility/VstsMigrator.git master
    Git push https://personalToken@github.com/nkdAgility/VstsMigrator.git head:master

    ```

    Here you can see that we are authenticating for the push, but there is no need for the Pull as the repository in Github is public. Once you validate that you can run these two commands locally we need to automate these two tasks. The easiest way to do this is to create a Build definition that is triggered when we check into the VSTS Git repository.

    ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1.png "clip_image001")
    { .post-img }

    On the Team Project that contains your Git repository you should create a new Empty build definition for us to execute the commands.

    ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002-2-2.png "clip_image002")
    { .post-img }

    Next you select the Git repository that you want to work with and that you want to use it as a CI. This will allow our automation to trigger when the code in the repository has been changed.

    ![clip_image003](images/clip_image003-3-3.png "clip_image003")
    { .post-img }

    Now that we have a blanc build definition in our Team Project we can go ahead and add the automation. In order to keep things simple and configurable I am going to simply add two "Command Line" tasks and call the commands that we need. This allows us to configure this easily in the web access without having to edit a script file. If you were doing this a lot you might create a custom task, but this keeps it configurable and easy.

    ![clip_image004](images/clip_image004-4-4.png "clip_image004")
    { .post-img }

    Click "Add" twice to get two command line calls…

    ![clip_image005](images/clip_image005-5-5.png "clip_image005")
    { .post-img }

    For each of the Git commands that we want to run we can easily select the Tool as "Git" and then pass the arguments into the arguments box. The first command is easy…

    Since the Build system will automatically clone our VSTS git repository locally we can assume that it already exists. So when we make this call to PULL from Github we are updating the clean clone of VSTS with any updates that have occurred in Github since we last Pushed.

    ![clip_image006](images/clip_image006-6-6.png "clip_image006")
    { .post-img }

    The second command is a little bit more interesting. We need to PUSH to Guthub which requires authentication. The easiest way to do this is to pass the authentication token in the URL of the command. Since I don’t want to expose this to everyone that can read my build definition I need to create a secret…

    ![clip_image007](images/clip_image007-7-7.png "clip_image007")
    { .post-img }

    Head on over to the Variables tab and add a new variable. Here you enter the [Personal Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) that you get from your account on Github. Done forget to click the little padlock to encrypt the data.

    If, like me, you work with lots of people you might consider creating a Bot account on Github so that it does not look like all the changes are pushed by you. As long as you add your VSTS email addresses to Github then all of the commits will be attributed correctly.

    ![clip_image008](images/clip_image008-8-8.png "clip_image008")
    { .post-img }

    Now save your build with an appropriate name.

    ![clip_image009](images/clip_image009-9-9.png "clip_image009")
    { .post-img }

    All that is left now is to run the build and see the results.

    ![clip_image010](images/clip_image010-10-10.png "clip_image010")
    { .post-img }

    Here you can see that the build has completed and all the secrets are preserved. Since we set this up as a [continuous integration]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-integration" >}}) the final test is to make a change to the repo in VSTS and see it push to Github.

    ![clip_image011](images/clip_image011-11-11.png "clip_image011")
    { .post-img }

    As you can see its supper simple to get your code Synching from VSTS to Github, but what if someone forks your repository on GitHub and then you accept a pull request.

    ## Automated Push from Github to VSTS

    In order to push from Github to VSTS we need to trigger another VSTS build when Github has changed. This is also very easy and is out of the box in VSTS.

    ```
    Git pull https://:personaltoken@nkdagility.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/defaultProject/_git/VstsMigrationTools master
    Git push https://:personaltoken@nkdagility.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/defaultProject/_git/VstsMigrationTools head:master

    ```

    Since there are no public repos in VSTS we need to authenticate both the PULL and the PUSH with a [personal token](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/get-started/setup/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate) from VSTS.

    ![clip_image012](images/clip_image012-12-12.png "clip_image012")
    { .post-img }

    And that is all…well… almost…

    ![clip_image013](images/clip_image013-13-13.png "clip_image013")
    { .post-img }

    When you configure a continuous integration build that is linked to a Github repository VSTS will automatically create the service hook on the other end and Github will trigger your VSTS build when someone checks into the specified branch.

    ## Conclusion

    It's really easy to setup and configure a synchronisation of code between Github and VSTS which allows you to take advantage of the capabilities of VSTS while still maintaining an open source repository and taking contributions. I can create work items in VSTS or TFS and create full-fidelity DevOps and agile practices for ideation, coding, testing, release, and monitoring…

    Don’t get stuck with inferior tooling that is hard to setup and maintain. Use VSTS as your full-stack orchestration and management tool and publish what you want to Github.

    I have a repository on Codeplex that was the result of the code that I had to write to move my blog from GeeksWithBlogs many moons ago over to Wordpress. This was a very difficult process and recently quite a few of my friends have had to go through it as well. Since GeeksWithBlogs has been sold to 'the man' many bugs have crept into the system and features are sparse. With the most recent request for access I decided it was time to ditch Codeplex and move to [Github]({{< ref "/tags/github" >}}). If you have not seen the writing on the wall yet the only Open Source host of any note is GitHub. All my private repositories are in VSTS ([http://tfs.visualstudio.com](http://tfs.visualstudio.com)) but anything Open Source will be moved to GitHub.

    ### Attempt 1: Using the Github Import tool #fail

    My first attempt was to use GitHub's provided tool at [https://import.github.com/](https://import.github.com/) to pull my CodePlex repo into GitHub. However the results are not even remotely consistent with what you would want. The GitHub tool effectively just grabs the entire codebase under the team project and shoves it into a Git repo.

    ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1.png "clip_image001")
    { .post-img }

    Effectively the GitHub import from TFS is inherently broken and is of no value to anyone. Well, maybe that’s a little harsh. If I was a complete incompetent and had the root of my project in the Team Project folder (not recommended by MSFT) then maybe it would be useful. I can't imagine that is a common scenario.

    Suggestions to GitHub: You should allow me to select a folder for the root of the import… in this case $/TeamProject/MAIN/

    I would take a guess that GitHub implemented this import just so that they can say that they support import from TFS and don’t really care if it is usable. It has some fairly fundamental flaws and I would avoid it at all costs.

    _UPDATE: I have heard from Github support that they consider this result a bug and that Branches should be honoured. Not sure how that works without being able to select your MAIN branch, but they are looking into it._

    ### Attempt 2: Using Git-TF to GitHub

    Next up is using Git-TF to do the import. This offers a lot more flexibility as you will see, so that we can import everything in a sane manner.

    1.  **Install Chocolatey -** First we need the tools, and the easiest way to get them is with Chocolaty. If you don’t already have Chocolatey installed then head over to [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/) and get it.
        ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002-2-2.png "clip_image002")
        { .post-img }
    2.  **Install Git-TF** - The easyest way to install Git-TF is to now call "_Choco Install Git-TF_". This will go off and install all of the pre-requisites an the main event. Chocolatey is one of my favourite tools and allows you to install almost any development or productivity tool.
        ![clip_image003](images/clip_image003-3-3.png "clip_image003")
        { .post-img }
        After only a few minutes (depending on your download speed) you will be all up and running, ready with both the Git command line, and Git-TF extensions.

            ![clip_image004](images/clip_image004-4-4.png "clip_image004")

        { .post-img }
        You may find that you get errors when using "git tf". I am not sure where that rabbit hole goes, but you can use "git-tf" to access the same commands nad they work. I would suggest that this is a bug in the software.

    3.  **Clone your TFVC repository to Git -** Now that we have all of the tools installed we need to get our code over. Now as I suggested with "Git-TF" you are able to select the folder that you want to clone. I made a new directory and navigated to that folder in PowerShell.
        `    Git-tf clone https://tfs.codeplex.com:443/tfs/TFS32 $/gwbtowp/MAIN --deep`

            ![clip_image005](images/clip_image005-5-5.png "clip_image005")

        { .post-img }
        As soon as you execute the command it will clone MAIN and create a new Git Repository in the current location with the same name as the folder. In this case I get a "MAIN". The "--deep" command will make sure that all of the history is taken, but watch out as this may take some time to complete if you have a large amount of history. Not perfect but it will work for me for now.

            If you need to make changes to the repository you can do it now and checkin… after that all we have to do is push the changes back to GitHub. For this I am going to add an origin and then push to that location.

    4.  **Add Github remote and Push** – Now that we have a copy of the code locally we can easily add a second remote and deliberately push our new master branch to GitHub.
        `    Git remote add github https://github.com/MrHinsh/gwb-to-wordpress.git
    Git push -u github master`

                ![clip_image006](images/clip_image006-6-6.png "clip_image006")

            { .post-img }
            That gets all of your code over onto GitHub but what about other things…

    5.  **Moving your Wiki Pages** - You might also have one or more Wiki pages that you want to migrate. Unfortunately Codeplex uses HTML and Github uses Markdown.
        ![clip_image007](images/clip_image007-7-7.png "clip_image007")
        { .post-img }
        Luckily I found a rather nice [converter for HTML to Markdown](http://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) that let me do this easily. Very few tweeks later and I had my markdown page ready.

    And that’t it, you might want to look at migrating other stuff like Releases and Issues, but really this is good enough for most people. Once you are happy you can go mark your CodePlex project as migrated..

    Do you worry that you will lose files on your computer? Well you should! At any time your harddrive can fail, or your house could be hit by a meteor, or stolen. I keep everything on my computer encrypted with BitLocker and can remote wipe any of my data, however I want to be able to access it from anywhere. Everything needs to be in at least two locations to be called a backup, a local separate disk is only partial backup and realis on being at home to backup leading to stale data. That means that the only viable place to securely store your data is the cloud.

    I also tend to work on more than one computer. I have a number of tablets, from a Surface 4, Surface 3's to the Dell Venue, and even a couple of HP Stream 7's. I want to be able to edit a file on one, and pick that file back up on any of the other tablets. Or even on my phone, or on a friends PC.

    For this I use OneDrive and OneDrive for Business depending on the content of the file. There are a couple of other solutions out there, like DropBox or iCloud, but OneDrive is mostly free and is built into the OS, and it just works. Oh it's had its issues over the years. I have about 40GB of personal data and 40GB of business user data all stored in OneDrive and OneDrive for Business respectively. Technically you only get 5GB for free, but if you get 1 terabyte with your Office 365 personal for OneDrive and 1 terabyte of OneDrive for Business for your business Office 365 subscription. There are a few other tasks that can get you more space, but if you bought a new PC you might have gotten two tokens. One for unlimited Skype for a year and the other for 1TB of OneDrive storage. I buy tablets and whatnot often enough that I have plenty…

    So… to make things really easy I want to store all of my files on OneDrive and I don’t want to have to think about it. So I want my Documents, Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos to all be automagically synced.

    In [Windows]({{< ref "/tags/windows" >}}) all of those folders are special folders. They are given special powers by the operating system and this allows them to integrate into the OS and applications. And it's really simple to map them to another folder in your OneDrive or OneDrive for Business.

    ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1.png "clip_image001")
    { .post-img }

    In Windows 10 (or 8, or 7) you can right click on any of the Special Folders, like Documents, and go to Properties…

    ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002-2-2.png "clip_image002")
    { .post-img }

    …Here you will see a "Location" tab where the file location is set. If you change this and point it to your OneDrive or OneDrive for Business (or DropBox or iCloud) then anything you put in Documents will also be saved to the cloud.

    I configured this for most of my family and while they don’t need to worry or care about it the number of times this has saved their bacon! Not only can you just re-sync a new computer, but OneDrive also has a recycle bin for anything deleted from it.

    ![clip_image003](images/clip_image003-3-3.png "clip_image003")
    { .post-img }

    Once you have changed the folder you will be asked to move all of the files, which I recommend, and then you will be asked if you are really sure that you want to merge the files. Merging can't really be undone as the folders will be intermixed so make sure you have both locations in order before you just squish them together.

    Now go do it for your other special folders, including Desktop, and everything you save will always be safe as long as you have an internet connection.

    I recent ran into a problem where my OneDrive files were taking up too much space on my main drive and preventing [Windows]({{< ref "/tags/windows" >}}) 10 updates on the Insider Program. This works for both OneDrive consumer application and the new OnDrive for Business beta application.

    ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1-1.png "clip_image001")
    { .post-img }

    Many moons ago I had partitioned my drive so that I could limit the amount of space that my Virtual Machines use. However these days I only have a single VM that is the Brian Keller TFS demo box for… well… demos. All my other machines I run in Azure. So I tend to have more free space on the Virtual drive and less on the Windows drive these days…

    My OneDrive file size is now up at 80GB+ so I really need the extra space on the C drive.

    ![clip_image002](images/clip_image002-1-2-2.png "clip_image002")
    { .post-img }

    However after so long it would be difficult to resize the partitions without breaking the ability to recover my computer easily, which I like.

    ![clip_image003](images/clip_image003-1-3-3.png "clip_image003")
    { .post-img }

    I love being able to pop into Recovery page and just reset Windows while keeping my files… awesome feature, especially if you are a Developer and incessant tinkerer and often break Windows.

    So, in order to move your OneDrive location you need to first "Unlink" your OneDrive account and then relink it back to the new location. The online documentation for this says that you have to re-download all of your files, but stuff that on 80GB. What if you are on a crappy or cellular internet connection! I want to move my files to the new location and have OneDrive just fire up with all of the files there. Good this this is easy and seamless…

    1. **First Unlink your OneDrive**  
        You need to be online to complete this procedure. I am currently onsite with a customer that has blocked OneDrive and had to connect through my phone. OneDrive takes some time to connect if you change connection, so using the tray Exit button and then running the OneDrive Desktop App (from Start) gives it a little kick.  
        ![clip_image004](images/clip_image004-4-4.png "clip_image004")  
       { .post-img }
       Once you are online you can open the tray menu and click Settings.  
        ![clip_image005](images/clip_image005-5-5.png "clip_image005")  
       { .post-img }
       Then click "Unlink". If your Unlink button is disabled, like above, then that means that you are not Online. You can connect to the internet and then reboot, or restart the OneDrive application.
    2. **Copy your files to the new location**  
        You need to cop all of your existing files to the new location. If you don’t copy all of the files anything missing will need to be re-downloaded. As Windows copy also takes all of your file properties if you have made changes to files, then these will be synched successfully after the move.  
        ![clip_image006](images/clip_image006-6-6.png "clip_image006")  
       { .post-img }
       I setup a d:\\Users\\MrHinsh\\OneDrive folder and "moved" all 80GB of my files over to the new location… this may take some time, or considerably longer depending on your drive speed. I happen to have a Surface 3 with SSD's so it's pretty quick for me.  
        You should also be mapping your Windows Special Folders to OneDrive so that you never lose a file again.
    3. **Setup OneDrive using the OOB experience  
        **Now we need to setup OneDrive again but change the mapping to the new location of our files.  
        ![clip_image007](images/clip_image007-7-7.png "clip_image007")  
       { .post-img }
       Just like the first time you setup Windows OneDrive you get the out-of-box experience when you click on the OneDrive folder.  
        ![clip_image008](images/clip_image008-8-8.png "clip_image008")  
       { .post-img }
       On the configuration screen click "Change" and select the new folder. OneDrive will detect that this location is already in use and you should "use this location".  
        ![clip_image009](images/clip_image009-9-9.png "clip_image009")
       { .post-img }

    And that’s it… your OneDrive files are not in a new location, and in my case, on a new disk. That’s 80GB freed up from my Windows drive…

    When someone comes to you with an opportunity in the developing world you better have a good reason to say no. For the last few years Nana Abana had been trying to achieve the impossible, conduct a high profile Agile event in West Africa. It's not just the holding of the event that seemed impossible, but getting together a group of people that can really bring agility to Africa. Up until now many of the endeavours  into agility in west africa have been pushed by sharlotons that are intent only in profiting from Africa and not improving development practices. Making money and not helping people. It is posible to do both, but you will need to invest up front to get there.

    [https://youtu.be/PkJ7JeL1H74](https://youtu.be/PkJ7JeL1H74)

    With events like Agile in Africa this will change as more people are exposed to the experts that make me proud to be part of the agile community. You can find all of the speakers recordings on the [Agile In Africa 2016 Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLOUjIo2HjA-Ct-EDd2bIQ) channel. This is one of the most knowlagable and exiting groups of people that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. It was a very exiting time for me…

    ![20151021-091145-084](images/20151021-091145-084-1-1.jpg "20151021-091145-084")
    { .post-img }

    Many of the speakers paid their own way and gave up local work to go. And I can tell you that not only was it personally worth it for me, but every single one of the speakers signed up for this year and for all three events:

    - **XP Day Africa - 25th October -** [**http://agileinafrica.com/xp-day/**](http://agileinafrica.com/xp-day/)
    - **[Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Day Africa - 26th October -** [**http://agileinafrica.com/scrum-day/**](http://agileinafrica.com/scrum-day/)
    - **Agile In Africa - 27th 28th October -** [**http://agileinafrica.com/agile-in-africa/**](http://agileinafrica.com/agile-in-africa/)

    This event is four days of awesomeness in Accra, Ghana and I hope to be running at least one session at each of the events.

    Last year there were a lot of crazy people, some I had met before, and others that brought a whole new level of crazy.

    ![clip_image004](images/clip_image004-5-5.jpg "clip_image004")
    { .post-img }

    One of the highlights of the week was visiting an orphanage with Sven who brought three Kano's for the kids. The idea behind the Kano is that because the kids build it themselves, they take more pride and ownership in the computer and thus discover more.

    ![clip_image005](images/clip_image005-6-6.jpg "clip_image005")
    { .post-img }

    There was a lot of press coverage of the event, with radio interviews and even a few TV segments. All in all it was a real blast.

    I am looking forward to this year's event, have you signed up yet?

    I have been working with a large customer in Norway that is moving to TFS whole sale and also needs to continue using a server based source control system for the time being. It would be awesome for them to be able to move to Git, however the codebase is currently incompatible. Work is ongoing to remove this issue, and many components will be able to move as soon as we can add Git repositories to a TFVC Team Project (in TFS 2015 Update 1). SO in the mean time we need a way to apply policies to particular branches.

    \[[Download Tfvc Branch Policy](http://nkdagility.net/TfsBranchPolicy)\]

    ![image](images/image-3-3.png "image")
    { .post-img }

    What I wanted was something like the existing Branch Policy feature for Git but in TFVC. This would need to be done as a Checkin Policy for it to work, so I went looking for existing policies, of which there are many. I found that while I could use existing policies in combination with the "pattern" policy that is part of the TFS Power Tools, however it would be an ugly and unwieldly solution.

    The customer has many projects as part of a single Team Project, and that would make it very difficult to manage many policies based on paths. We needed a consolidated and simple solution.

    ![image](images/image-1-1-1.png "image")

    This is what I wanted, a list of branches on the left, coupled to a set of policies on the right. We can then extend the policies as we decide what is needed. However it was quickly identified that they often applied policies across multiple branches. Specifically they have a year based branching structure that is replicated through all of the components. So for "Product 2016" they also deploy "Component A 2016". There are hundreds of components that make up the final Product so…

    …I moved to a much simpler to implement regular expression model. We have a list of regular expressions, and then apply that regular expression to the list of pending changes to find out which ones should be applied. Now that we have a list of matching Branch Patterns I can then integrate through each of them and evaluate the Branch Policies. These policies can be applied to multiple branches (paths) that match a simple pattern and then failures can then be transformed into messages for the developer.

    The goal is not to create a list of 100 things developers have to go do. There is an expectation of due diligence and [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}) expected of every coder, so you will not see a "must run tests before checkin". The idea is that we want to make sure that folks with good intent don’t forget to do one of the big ticket items. Like builds, work items, code reviews, or production locks.

    Current Policies that have been implemented:

    1. **Branch Lock** - There are many reasons that you might want to lock a branch, maybe you need to prevent changes to code without approval as you move towards a release. Whatever the reason you can specify that a chosen pattern is locked and what the optional bypass string is. The bypass string needs to be entered into the comment for the checkin. Simple and effective.
    2. **Code Review** - You must have at least one Code Review, and any Code Reviews need to have been successful
    3. **Work Items** – Require at least one work item first, then I will likley implement the ability to select the types of workitems that are required.

    This is a start and you are welcome to send feedback to \[bla\] in the form of issues or requests. Give it a try and provide me with feedback. All feedback is good feedback :) even if I don’t agree.

    Just before the end of the year I taught my [first Professional Scrum Master course in Norway](http://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master/) and it was a resounding success. We had 30 students from some of the largest and most successful companies in Norway. The feedback was incredible and I had an awesome time teaching it.

    ![clip_image001](images/clip_image001-1-1.jpg "clip_image001")

    It has been so successful that we have scheduled 3 more Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master deliveries in Olso and one in Kongsberg, we have even scheduled a [Professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) Developer, also in Olso.

    ### Professional [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}})

    The Professional Scrum Master course is equivalent to the Certified Scrum Practitioner and covers the key skills needed for experienced Scrum Masters to up their game. We dont really cover the basics of Scrum to allow us to focus the full two days on the mastery of managing the Scrum frameowrk for a team or organisation. There are lots of advanced topics like [Coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}) Stance and Active Listening that are the cornerstone of being a sucessfull Scrum Master.

    NOTE: If you are looking for a course similar to the Certified Scrum Master then you should look to the Professional Scrum Foundations course. Learning the basics does not make you a master :)

    ### Professional Scrum Developer

    The Professional Scrum Developer course and certification is designed to give your development teams the skills and knowledge necessary to deliver high quality [working software]({{< ref "/tags/working-software" >}}) in less than 30 days. It is the only official training for Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) from Microsoft and is maintained by Scrum.org and some of the best technical people in the world.

    In just 3 days this course uses practical experiance to explore [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) and Agile practices and tools that you need to get ahead and deliver frequently. The majority of the course is focused on the tools (Visual Studio with TFS or VSTS) and the practices (like SOLID and TDD) that you need to adopt inorder to increase delivery while maintaining quality.

    NOTE: Although the course can be taught with any programming language, this one will be .NET and C#. Feel free to request any language verient that you would like to see, however we would need at least 8 students to make it worth creating a custom version.
