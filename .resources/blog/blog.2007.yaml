    I had a number of problems installing [SharePoint 3.0 Service Pack 1](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx) and then [Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Service Pack 1](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-the-2007-microsoft-office-servers-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx). In fact, I managed to put my server completely out of action and I have been trying to fix it off and on for a couple of weeks (I have been on holiday). This being my only day in for the rest of this year, I thought I should give it another go, as I did not want the server down for another week...

    Well, I found a little called [kb841216](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841216/en-us) that describes the problem:

    > "0x80040E14" or "HTTP 500" error message when you connect to your Windows SharePoint Services Web site after you install a Windows SharePoint Services service pack or a security update

    The reason I get the errors is that the content databases are not at the same version as the application files causing an inability for SharePoint to read the database. You can solve this by running a nice little stsadm command:

    > cd /d %commonprogramfiles%Microsoft SharedWeb Server Extensions60Bin
    >
    > stsadm -o upgrade -forceupgrade

    This may not fix your problems, but it sure fixed mine....

    Now to get the [Virus Protection problems](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/no-love-between-mcafee-enterprise-and-moss-2007.aspx) solved....

    I am sorry to tell you all that I am now (as of Friday past) off for the holiday period. With a little luck and some saved holidays I will not be back in the office until the 3rd January 2008 :) I will be in the office for damage control on the 31st, but apart from that I am a free man...

    Well, I have been looking after my daughter and playing my [XBOX](http://www.360voice.com/blog.asp?tag=hinshelm "hinshelm's Xbox 360 Blog") and generally [faffing](http://www.elfyourself.com/?id=1466005756 "I got Elfed!") around with a lot of miscellaneous Christmas stuff online. I have still not got my [Sharepoint 2007 development box working](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx) after the [Service Pack 1 / McAfee](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/no-love-between-mcafee-enterprise-and-moss-2007.aspx) fandangle, but I am hopping that I can get it done at some point this week, if for nothing else but piece of mind...

    I am keeping up with my feed reading, an I came across an [article](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/features/article.aspx?editorialsid=1788) on the Visual Studio Magazine site that highlights the little known uses of WPF. The author (Kathleen Dollard) highlights the things that I thought WPF was for anyway (but largely ignored) and its benefits over WinForms. I think that Kathleen has hit the nail right on the head that WPF will be the way foreword for future .NET application development, but it does have a steep learning curve and it is different from the way that we have built applications in the past. I have resigned myself to learn this black art of WPF and increase my skill set with this worthwhile weapon in my arsenal.

    I can only hope that Kathleen Dollard and other experts provide the same level and topics of articles, and like Kathleen said, Microsoft should also push its developers to show off WPF in this way.[![](images/hinshelm-2-2.png)](http://profile.mygamercard.net/hinshelm)
    { .post-img }

    So its WPF for me this holiday...

    I will leave you with the "[Hinshelwood family Christmas elf's](http://www.elfyourself.com/?id=1466005756 "Hinshelwood family christmass elfs")" or "[me as scrooge](http://www.scroogeyourself.com/?id=1538113679)" if you are on the other Christmas spirit :)

    P.S. Yippee, 200 posts...Just in time for the New Year...

    Well I think I have found the root of the problem with my Microsoft office SharePoint Server 2007 dev box! It was McAfee  plain and simple.

    > _Event Type:    Error  
    > Event Source:    Windows SharePoint Services 3 Search  
    > Event Category:    Gatherer  
    > Event ID:    2424  
    > Date:        13/12/2007  
    > Time:        09:36:06  
    > User:        N/A  
    > Computer:    GLA1VS09  
    > Description:  
    > The update cannot be started because the content sources cannot be accessed. Fix the errors and try the update again._
    >
    > _Context: Application 'Search', Catalog 'index file on the search server Search'_
    >
    > _For more information, see Help and Support Center at_ [_http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp_](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp)_._

    I get the above error about the Search Catalog repeatedly during the installation of SP1, and wrapped around it I get a bunch of IRC port block information items from McAfee. This is more than coincidence and I have requested that our infrastructure team remove McAfee from all SharePoint servers so we don't have this kind of problem in the future.

    Now, McAfee say that they support SharePoint Services 3.0, but MOSS has a bunch of extra features (Enterprise Search being one) that are not around in WSS. It seams that there are specific versions of Anti-Virus products for SharePoint Portal Servers and for good reason...

    Hopefully I can get this sorted soon.

    Got loads of options, but no way to change them...typical service pack build of the base installer...Not a problem with me, familiar. Makes those production guys feel at home.

    _Well, first attempt failed. I will try a reboot and see if there are any pending updates or just general trash interfering. If you have ever had to read a SharePoint install log, you will know that they are next to useless. Roll on TFS install style logs for SharePoint. Hint, hint..._

    So far it is exactly the same show as with the WSS update. Installing updates before moving onto the main feature... And it did not ask me to install WSS SP1 this time.. That is another one of those mixed signs...

    The installation for MOSS SP1 is identical to that of WSS SP1 so I foresee no problems...

    [![image_thumb[7]](images/MOSSSP1InstallNoteswithasadending_98B5-image_thumb7_thumb-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MOSSSP1InstallNoteswithasadending_98B5-image_thumb7_2.png)

    Well, except maybe the same one that I has from WSS SP1. The message clearly states, as it did in WSS SP1 that I should correct the problem and run the update again, but if I run it again I am told that it is already installed! WTF?

    here ist he relevent section of the log file (see what I mean about Sharepoint Logs) in the hopes that someone else has had the same problem:

    [![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_3-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    Over the past year of using the [Windows Mobile Device Center](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devicecenter.mspx) on Vista as well as [ActiveSync 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/activesync/default.mspx) I have become increasingly disillusioned with them both and searching for another tool that would do the job better.

    ## Why Mobile Device Center is a bit pants!

    I have found that it has become increasingly difficult to connect my mobile to this software and I have had to hard reset my phone a number of times to get it to work again. At the moment it just does not connect at all to my laptop at home, which is just as well as I would end up with a multitude of duplicate contacts ever time I sync between two mobile. And not just my contacts, at some points I have had my phone go off at midnight (when I am sleeping) with five or six birthday alerts for the same person!

    [ActiveSync](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/activesync/default.mspx) has many of the same problems...

    ## Interim Solutions

    I even went through a phase of installing [Exchange 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server) and [Active Directory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory) on my server just to use [Exchange ActiveSync](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998357.aspx)...Which is cool, and useful.. But not really worth the overhead of managing it at home.

    [![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_2-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    I wanted to go further and have my contacts update their own information. So I started using [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood) as a contact repository, and using the [LinkedIn Outlook toolbar](http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_otb) I had a lot of success. I have used [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood) for this purpose for a couple of years now, but I am now finding that I have a multitude of these collaboration sites under my belt, and I really need a tool that sync's with all my online tools and my offline ones.

    ## A better way

    [![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_2.png) And so this leads me to [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com). This is by far and away the best tool I have come across. It's so good, I even paid the subscription fee to get the extra features like Mobile Sync, contact backup and others. _And you know that is not like me :)_
    { .post-img }

    [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com) has this marvelous tool called the "De-duper". Can you imagine what it does :). And I will tell you something, I went from 1250 ish contacts to 920 without even breaking a sweat...

    There are many more Syncing options available, although some are only for paid up members...

    And what does [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com) do for me...

    ### **Contacts**

    [![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_5-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    Plaxo provides a single point of truth for all my contacts. I can have an email sent to any of my contacts to get them to update their details, and they do not even need to be members of Plaxo to do this :).

    - Sync's my Contacts from Outlook at work
    - Sync's my Contacts from Outlook at home
    - Sync's my contacts from my phone
    - Sync's my contacts from LinkedIn (One Way)
    - Sync's my contacts from Google

    I get a very nice little profile ([http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com)) that I can control how and who can view my information.

    ### Calendar

    [![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_6-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_14.png)
    { .post-img }

    I have two calendars setup on Plaxo that overlay. One for my personal and one for my Office calendar items. Both calendars applier in both my Outlook's and as I am using 2007 I can overlay them if I want to.

    - Sync's my Calendar from Outlook at work
    - Sync's my Calendar from Outlook at home
    - Sync's my Calendar from my phone
    - Sync's my Calendar from Google (One Way) \[hopefully not for long\]

    My calendars are published in two formats: one that has a friendly URL ([http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com/calendar](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com/calendar)) that is publicly available as a free busy publication and one that has a crazy URL that has my actual meeting subjects in them for private access.

    All of my calendars are synced to my phone "over the air" in a consolidated view...

    ## The future

    There are a number of features I would like to see in Plaxo as, although they are in beta testing of version 3 of their website (the one I am using) there are a couple of niggly things that mildly irritate me. Though I am impressed with the number and functionality of the syncs that are available. Many more than I use...

    - The ability to see the last time contacts details were updated by me, and by them (even if they are not members of Plaxo)...Maybe an option to request an update from all contacts that have not updated details in 1 year.
    - No notification on my windows mobile for PlaxoSync when it fails to connect unless I manually initiated a Sync.
    - The ability to choose when adding an event which calendar it goes into from my phone...Currently I am not sure what will happen...
    - The ability to control the viability of individual fields of information on my profiles...mainly to control what is displayed on my [http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com) page.
    - Adding the ability to sync RSS feed lists with Outlook, IE, Google and others....

    I came across this amazing new service which is very similar to [ClusterMaps](http://www.clustermaps.com/), [NeoWORX](http://www.neoworx.net/). It is a bit of a pain in Flash as the system resources required for flash these days seams a little excessive, but I would like to see it running as a WPF XBAP.

    In fact I would go as far as to say, that would be something my company would pay money for. You see we have generators in service and at depots all over the world. that is our Fleet if you will, and our board members would eat up this kind of thing. If we could pass it some geographical data and plot all of our generators and coolers around the world in real time it would be a fantastic data presentation tool for the board.

    I think that the globe above , while cool, is a wee bit to gimmicky for that purpose, but the [NeoEarth](http://www.neoworx.net/blue/neoearth_page.php) feature would better suit our needs...

    All it needs is for [NeoWORX](http://www.neoworx.net/) to provide some sort of SDK with a local install of the engine for corporate customers to send their application any Geo tagged data :) With, hopefully, the ability to control what appears in the popup's :)

    Well, due to my campaign to get lots of free bandwidth I now have an additional 2.3 GB on top of my initial free 2GB bringing the grand total to 4.3 GB of online storage with [Mozy](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG)!

    This is fantastic as I have more than enough room for all of my files. But, in the interest of keeping my consumption low, I have remove certain files from the backup:

    - All my music: mainly because I can get it again :)
    - All my source code: its stored on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") anyway.
    - Emails: I use Google Mail and have masses of space from them anyway.

    This means that I have plenty of free space (I am only at 66% ish usage) for all those word docs and presentations.

    Now I have a couple of family members signed up I can see that [Mozy](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG) really is easy to use as with only a [few minutes reading](https://mozy.com/support) all my relatives were able to actually understand what they were getting and why...

    Again I would like to thank a few guys for their mega byte support:

    [Andrew Stifora](http://stifora.com/), [Garrett Hoofman](http://geekswithblogs.net/gambit_sunob/Default.aspx), [Peter Benschop](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/56A/667), chan pen, Jeroen te Strake, Thomas Williams, Jim Calder, [Stuart McVicar](http://stuartmcvicar.net/2007/08/26/charging-membership-for-forums/), John Hinshelwood

    A few months ago I found a cool site called [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com). I did not understand the premise at first, but after seeing the prizes page, I thought, what the heak! Community Credit is the brain child of one David Silverlight, and yes, it is quite possible that "Silverlight" was named after him :). What is this wondrous site you may ask...Well, its part bragging, part recognition, and part prizes :)

    I thought, "this is fantastic, getting prizes for what I am doing anyway", and started posing all of the things I have been involved in to do with technology.

    In my second month of posting I tore the cartilage in my knee (Ouch!) and so with nothing to occupy my tiny brain and noting that David was looking for moderators I emailed him to see if I fitted the bill. And I did!

    David just [posted](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/community_credit_news/archive/2007/11/29/Thanks_2C00_-Martin-Hinshelwood_2C00_-you-Saved-the-Day.aspx) a nice recognition blog about it...thanks David...what about some extra credit :)

    I am having a look at Microsoft's [Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) as a solution to our disparate user identity problem. Some of the bigger companies out there have solved this problem, and in many of the smaller companies it just does not exist, but we have many system that hold meta data about our employees. From HR systems to Active Directory and custom web based address books. Because of Aggreko's unprecedented growth these systems have outgrown our capacity to maintain the consistency of the data, with small groups responsible for each repository and everyone not knowing where ALL the repository's are or who controls them.

    The idea of [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) server is to provide a single "metaverse" where all of the data is stored that has agents and adapters for all of the systems that you have. These agents and adapters are responsible for pulling and pushing the data between the stores in a consistent manor, so if HR in France updates a users job title it gets pulled into the "metaverse" and then pushed out to all of other system connected to [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx).

    > #### **How Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007 Works**
    >
    > [![](images/48505_375x262_miis_f.jpg)](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/overview.mspx)
    > { .post-img }

    Out of the box ILM 2007 [supports](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/overview.mspx) the following agents and connectors:

    > **_Network Operating Systems and Directory Services_**
    >
    > _Microsoft Active Directory Windows Server 2003 R2, 2003, and 2000  
    > Microsoft Active Directory Application Mode Windows Server 2003 R2 and 2003  
    > Microsoft Windows NT 4.0  
    > IBM Tivoli Directory Server  
    > Novell eDirectory 8.6.2, 8.7, and 8.7.x  
    > Sun Directory Server (Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE) 4.x and 5.x_
    >
    > **_Mainframe_**
    >
    > _IBM Resource Access Control Facility  
    > Computer Associates eTrust ACF2  
    > Computer Associates eTrust Top Secret_
    >
    > **_Email and Messaging_**
    >
    > _Microsoft Exchange 2007, 2003, 2000, and 5.5  
    > Lotus Notes 6.x, 5.0, and 4.6_
    >
    > **_Applications_**
    >
    > _SAP 5.0 and 4.7  
    > Telephone switches  
    > XML-based systems  
    > DSML-based systems_
    >
    > **_Databases_**
    >
    > _Microsoft SQL Server 2005, 2000, and 7  
    > IBM DB2  
    > Oracle 10g, 9i, and 8i_
    >
    > **_File-Based_**
    >
    > _Attribute value Pairs  
    > CSV  
    > Delimited  
    > Fixed Width  
    > Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) 2.0  
    > LDAP Interchange Format (LDIF)_
    >
    > **_All Other_**
    >
    > _Extensible Management Agent for connectivity to all other systems_

    But [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) supports way more than just data consistency. It will even provision Active Directory accounts and mail accounts automatically if an employee is added by HR enabling this process to be automated. You could have HR create a user in their system and set the relevant "profile" that the relates to the user and have their AD and mail setup along with permissions for SharePoint sites, folder shares and any other custom system you care to name ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif) I like this system already... even if it only does half of what it says on the box it could be a very effective tool in the arsenal of any companies automation strategies.
    { .post-img }

    A good point to note is wither the Data protection Act covers information about a person stored by the company they work for! I am not sure wither the same rules apply, but it is of benefit to any company if users details are accurate across all of their systems.

    The [benefits](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/idm/default.mspx) according to Microsoft's

    propaganda marketing:

    > - _**Improve Operational Efficiency**  
    >    Now businesses can aggregate identities across the enterprise into a single view, simplify user access to multiple applications, reduce IT costs, and increase productivity._
    > - _**Boost Compliance**  
    >    Companies can ensure that every user has proper access to resources, create auditable processes for access rights, and deploy single sign-on capabilities that comply with company policy._
    > - _**Heighten Security**  
    >    Businesses can reduce the risk of security leaks by ensuring that only authorized users can gain access to company resources and that people know who they are dealing with electronically._
    > - _**Enable Business Success**  
    >    By securely sharing identities across organizational boundaries, businesses can collaborate more efficiently with partners and customers._

    We will see! I am currently installing a dev box and I will evaluate it according to the specific needs of our business...

    Well, I currently have two referrals :)

    Thanks to [Garrett Hoofman](http://geekswithblogs.net/gambit_sunob/Default.aspx "Garrett Hoofman") and _[Andrew Stifora](http://stifora.com/)_ who got their fingers out and [got backed up](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/11/26/Mozy-Backup.aspx)! Hopefully the others that have signed up with my referral link will complete a backup as well so we can all benefit (well me!) from the extra space.

    Go on get an [extra 250MB](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG) added to your 2GB of storage when you get [Mozy online backup](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG).

    It seams that in order to clamed a referral bonus the referee needs to have completed at least one backup:

    > #### _**Referrals**_

    >
    > _Your referral URL:_ _[https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG)_

    I thought I should "name and shame" those that have gone only half way :)  Get backing up!

    I was looking for an online backup solution and [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OnLosingDataAndAFamilyBackupStrategy.aspx) provided it for me: Thanks Scott and good luck with all the [new stuff](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NewJobNewHouseNewBabyAndDesigningATotallyNewHomeOffice.aspx) :).

    These days, with all of your...lets call it "stuff" being mostly digital. The photos of the kids, your correspondence, all your work... You need backup...

    I have been looking for a solution that does not brake the bank, but the best I could find was "BT" who charge and arm and a leg while probably losing your data. If the government can lose 7 million peoples personal details (du..post? How dumb can you get!) then BT can lose your backup. With Mozy being a smaller company, all be it partnered with someone bigger, loosing your data could brake them, so it is in their interest to provide the best service rather than best-effort as you would get from BT or another monolithic company that really does not care about your data, just your money...

    [![image](images/MozyBackup_10C2F-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    I have only just started using [Mozy Backup](https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) but I think it is a winner. With 2GB of free space (which never does the job :)) it is a fantastic solution. And it is only $5 for unlimited space, Wow...

    It has a really simple setup, even my dad could work it, and just chugs away in the background. You get options (pictured above) for wither you want quicker backups or a faster computer, but with 2.5GB of data to get through I opted for the faster backup.

    And speaking of data size, did you notice that I don't have enough space for a full backup? Well if you sign up using this URL [https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG](https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) you get an extra 250mb, and so do I :)

    { .post-img }

    Only 11 hours to go till I have a full backup :)

    Better late than never, but I [attended](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/11/20/VS2008-Update.aspx) a [MSDN event](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-GB&eventid=1032355353) on Tuesday night in Edinburgh. Although I eagerly signed up for it, I did not expect to learn a lot:

    **Windows SharePoint 3.0** - [Martin Parry](http://www.martinparry.com/)

    I am not usually a fan of Martin's speaking, but it seems that it might have been due to the content that I have heard him present in the past. maybe he just always got the short straw for the boring content at previous events I have attended, but this time I was presently surprised.

    I found Martin's incite into SharePoint Services 2007 very informative and interesting and I learned the following key points about WSS3.0 that interested me:

    - Office SharePoint Designer is for users

    > _Although SharePoint designer is the "new" front page, it is definitely for "power" users of SharePoint. Its ability to make simple Workflow easy and to allow the user more control over many facets of the sites and lists is invaluable. Granted this is not the tool for all users. Most users are content to point and click within SharePoint itself, but when that is not enough (and when you need a new type of workflow it is not), this is the tool that they will turn to. It works very like all of the office products with a friendly users interface and a default tendency to hide the code that may frighten a less experienced power user._

    - Not for relational things!

    > _Martin pointed out that this is a mistake that many developers get into with SharePoint, and being one of those unfortunate developers who has tried to struggle with relational content, I agree with him that SharePoint does not handle it well. This is not a bad thing, just a limitation to be aware of. I have spent many hours trying to get a list in Site A to load content from another list in Site B, which is just not the way to do it..._

    - SharePoint workflow with VS2008

    > _The new SharePoint 2007 Workflow projects within Visual Studio 2008 look very impressive and beats the previous method in VS2005 hands down. You can find the new projects under the "Office" section of your chosen language in VS2008._
    >
    > [_![image](images/EventMSDNSharePointforDevelopers_F0A9-image_thumb-1-1.png)_](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-EventMSDNSharePointforDevelopers_F0A9-image_2.png)
    > { .post-img }

    **An introduction to MOSS 2007** - [David Gristwood](http://blogs.msdn.com/david_gristwood/)

    This was the first time I had seen David perform on stage and I was quite impressed. He initially seams agitated, as he hops about on stage, but as the session unfolded it becomes just part of his presentation style. He gets very exited about the subjects he is talking about and can make even boring subjects seam interesting. Here are the cool things I found interesting:

    - Enterprise search is very cool

    > _This is something that I knew already, but it was good to see a demo implementation and even a quick look at Microsoft's own internal implementation of Search within an organisation._

    - Search can search exchange and custom databases (BDC)

    > _The ability to integrate BDC information into your search results, I think is invaluable. You could give users the ability to look up Customers or in our case Fleet units or products and link them all together. Very powerfully..._

    - Use info path for forms

    > _I had not really seen any info path implementation prior to this presentation, but I had played about with it and noted the lack of customisation and lack of direct integration inside of SharePoint. What David showed us however convinced me that if users need to fill out a form, it should be done in info path. It is a fantastic tool to add to the arsenal of SharePoint._

    I found the whole thing very informative and I would recommend it to both novices and experts as it helped me fill in some of the blanks and gain incite into future improvements.

    Well it seems that Microsoft took the generally felt community suggestion and bundles Team Explorer with Visual Studio 2008 team Suit. I don't know if they did the same with VS2008 Pro or the other version, but it would seem a good idea.

    I had a few problems uninstalling Beta 2, but I got there in the end and now have VS2008 RTM and MSDN installed, and I am just waiting for Team Explorer's install to complete.

    Then I will see if all my projects from beta 2 need upgraded and wither the source control copes with it. I will defiantly try the upgrade in a branch to make sure I don't totally "gub" my projects ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif)

    This afternoon I will be attending a Microsoft event in Edinburgh "[MSDN: SharePoint Developers](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-GB&eventid=1032355353)" which should be interesting, and then I have a wee meeting with the folks in MS tomorrow to go over anything that was missed and to discuss my companies impending MOSS 2007 deployment.

    A busy couple of days...

    ![lightbulb](images/lightbulb-2-2.gif) Something occured to me after seeing the [Family Show](http://www.vertigo.com/familyshow.aspx) application from [Vertigo](http://www.vertigo.com). If you have not seen this application it is definitely worth a look. What I want to achieve would be to display and allow the edit of company Higherarchical data through a similar interface to the one presented in Family Show.
    { .post-img }

    [![image](images/HoldonladsIhaveanidea_C77C-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HoldonladsIhaveanidea_C77C-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    The data would be centric around an employee, with data for Management, organisational and cost higherarchies. It would allow users to edit selected information about their subordinates and to create fictional reorganisations of the company. Users would be able to edit their own data and search for any user, group or organisational unit.

    The data would be fed into a database after workflow on authorising the updates has been completed and would them make its way into all the other systems within the organisation including HR system, Active Directory and SharePoint.

    ![smile_sarcastic](images/smile_sarcastic-4-4.gif) So just a small task then...
    { .post-img }

    It should be possible to get the project off the ground by providing a single point of truth for information on staff. This in conjunction with technologies like SharePoint and Communication Server should provide substantial business benefit to companies  holding data about its staff in multiple systems geographically.

    In my quest to

    play with test VB 9.0 and it very cool  features I created a little application to update Active Directory. I was asked by my boss (Andre) to get some sense of order into Active Directory for the users that will be involved in the proof of concept for MOSS 2007. So I immediately thought of an application to automate this.

    The idea was to pull the information from AD for the selected users into a database and then make all the changes that are required there before updating AD with the new values.

    This works very well, but I am unable to test most of the AD update procedures as I only have permission to update my own Office and telephone number fields; Which work just fine...

    One of the guys from infrastructure are coming over this afternoon to run the application under his login, which will be a full test ![smile_omg](images/smile_omg-2-2.gif) I hope nothing goes wrong...

    I am a little confused by the RTM release of VS2008. I cant find a copy of the Team Explorer RTM or wither it is bundled with Team Suit. This would be a problem if I uninstalled everything only to find that I can't get my source control...

    **Does anyone know if Team Suit is bundled with VS2008 Team Suit?**

    When I was on MSDN earlier there was only one download and that was Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit. Now that have added more downloads, and the site is dead again :)

    All the flavours are here, but no Team Explorer? Do I need to download Team Foundation Server just to get Team Explorer? Granted I need it anyway as I have a deployed instance of [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Beta 2, but not at home :)

    And where is the .NET 3.5 redistributable... I have applications that are hot to trot but I can't roll out on Beta 2.

    Ah well, I will stow my impatience and wait...

    Well, its official. Visual Studio 2008 and .NET 3.5 went RTM this morning....

    So I will be spending the next wee while moving to the full release. if I can ever get the MSDN site to load. At the moment I have been waiting a couple of minutes for it, and no sign yet... That's everyone in the UK and probably European development communities hitting the site mercilessly. I know I will be...

    I decided that I should have a go at this LINQ thing, so as .NET 3.5 will be RTM at the end of the month I am using LINQ and .NET 3.5 in my new Locator project.

    The Locator project is just a small application that will run on a users computer and tell a central server where they are. In Aggreko we have the problem that people are moving about a lot (everyone has a laptop) and when you are looking for someone you need to be able to find them.

    The application sits and poles the IP address of the local computer, and when it get an internal IP (i.e. not localhost) it will send that IP to a [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") service for identification. If it is an IP that represents an internal company IP it sends back the detected location to the client and stores it in a database. The client then updates the physicalDeliveryOfficeName property in Active Directory and notifies the user of their location.

    The information updated into Active Directory will then be visible on SharePoint and in any presence display.

    As you can see the SharePoint listing is considerably out of date. This is because of the Schedule associated with its import of profiles. it does not seam as if it can be done any more regularly than once a day ![smile_sad](images/smile_sad-7-3.gif)

    The LINQ comes to the forefront when I am updating the database from the service. LINQ made this incredibly easy, but produced some strange looking SQL.

    > ```
    >  ' Get single value. This will execute the SQL
    >             Dim wai_Uip = (From val_uip In DataStore.WhereAmI_UserIPs _

    Well this was fun... All the [examples](http://dotnet.org.za/jpfouche/archive/2007/03/23/sharepoint-2007-rss-viewer-and-proxy-configuration.aspx "Missing details") of how to connect through a proxy from SharePoint are missing a crucial piece of information!

    ```
    <system.net>
       <defaultProxy>
          <proxy usesystemdefault = "false" proxyaddress="http://proxyservername" bypassonlocal="true" />
       </defaultProxy>
    </system.net>
    ```

    This is the accepted route, with an exception to e added to the proxy to use anonymous authentication...

    But is you use:

    ```
    <defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials="true">
      <proxy usesystemdefault="false" proxyaddress=http://proxyservername" bypassonlocal="true" />
      <bypasslist>
        <add address="[a-z]+.domain.biz" />
        <add address="[a-z]+.domain2.biz" />
      </bypasslist>
    </defaultProxy>
    ```

    The required bit of which is the useDefaultCredentials parameter that passes the logged on users credentials on to the proxy server.

    ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif) Now all I need to do is get the double-hop authentication to work...

    **You receive error 401.1 when you browse a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Web site that uses Integrated Authentication and is hosted on IIS 5.1 or IIS 6**

    This little problem occurs when you have Windows 2003 SP1 or later installed and you try to change your Team Foundation Server to a friendly name, like say tfs01.\[intranet\].\[company\].com.

    What I found was that when you tried to view tfs01.\[intranet\].\[company\].com on the local server, it popped up an authentication dialog and would not allow you in. Eventually giving you a 401 error.

    I consulted with one of Aggreko's Infrastructure Team guys, Gary Hay (no blog! Gary...Get a blog) , who when I pointed out the problem said, in way more polite terms, "WTF"!

    After a surprisingly short time, he sent me a link and told me it was fixed: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861 "http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861")

    > _This issue occurs if you install Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1). Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 include a loopback check security feature that is designed to help prevent reflection attacks on your computer. Therefore, authentication fails if the FQDN or the custom host header that you use does not match the local computer name._

    First, why would you want your server called the same as your website, and second, why would you NOT be hosting multiple sites under multiple host headers on the same server. I can only think of a couple of servers I have setup that have only one site, and it is NEVER called the same thing as the server...

    After some testing I found that it was indeed fixed. Now, I had this exact same problem at Merrill Lynch and even with their hundreds, if not thousands of technical folk, no one could solve the problem. Just goes to show...just coz you are big and have masses of people, does not mean you have the right people...

    ![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-1-1.gif) Thanks Gary...

    Well, setting up TFS 2008 is pretty easy. I have done an upgrade before, but I have now deployed my first pure TFS 2008 server to a clean environment. I have Reporting Services, SQL and TFS on one box and SharePoint 2007 in my Farm. Word of warning:

    > **_RTFM_**

    The first thing I did after a successfully install of TFS was make sure that I could create my first project "Test 1". This is essential to determine that everything is working and should be done on the server to prevent any other issues getting in the way.

    [![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_2.png) 
    { .post-img }

    The only problem I had was getting the reporting working. The first issue was authentication. When I checked the "Default Website" config it was set to anonymous only, so I changed that to "Integrated Windows" and that solved the authentication issues.

    [![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    The second problem was that I changed the reporting server URL, again to the friendly one and it broke SharePoint. I have a SharePoint 2007 Farm where all the TFS portals will be deployed. Even though I ran "TfsConfigWss.exe" located in the Tools folder on the SharePoint server after installing the SharePoint TFS component I still needed to run a register hack to get it to work. The key is under the Local Machine @SoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio9.0TeamFoundationReportServer and you get a key for each of your SharePoint managed paths.

    [![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    What TFS does now does that is very nice is that you can have multiple TFS servers deploying to the same SharePoint farm. So I created a Managed Path of "TFS01" (my first TFS server at Aggreko, Awww) and pointed TFS at it.

    I then changed the name of the server to a friendly name. This is no longer the [nasty mess it once was](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Team-Foundation-Server-amp-SharePoint-3.0.aspx): The TfsAdminUtil.exe now has functionality to change all of the URLs for TFS, SharePoint and RS, so that was easy.

    But I still have the old issue of not being able to authenticate when I am on the server once I have changed the "name" of TFS from the server name (default) to a friendly URL.

    This is no problem as that was how it worked in my previous environment. I think it is a proxy server issue, but I am not sure. Not much of a problem though...

    And here I though I was waving good buy to [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") in the short term, but here I am Installing it for [Aggreko](http://www.aggreko.co.uk). My boss came to me a couple of days ago and asked for a Work Item Tracking system in SharePoint 2007. I did my best, but as the requirements got more complicated and the metrics that they wanted to report on exploded, I said that TFS was the answer...

    This is not just a deployment of TFS for the purposes of tracking development projects. Nor is it only to be used for non-IT projects, but across the board of our companies project management. If I can prove that it will work :)

    Some of the features that they have hinted at I know will not be there until Rosario is available, and other features will require some amount of customization, especially some of the fleet utilization capabilities we want to build in among other things.

    In the short term we want to use as many of the out of the box functionality as possible, but major customizations are on the way... I will need to resurrect my [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) for some of the things we have been discussing and implement the Windows Workflow functionality that I threatened to do before.

    On that note, and to bring SharePoint 2007 properly into the mix...has anyone setup any Business Data Catalog stuff that points to SharePoint? Hmm, interesting...

    And just when the cost of Team Suit was getting me down I got an email from my good friend Jon Pratt from Microsoft UK saying that he had a spare copy of TFS 2005 and Team Suit 2005 sitting on his desk and would I like it ![smile_wink](images/smile_wink-3-3.gif) Its funny how things work out...

    This is an issue of contention in many companies, but I am firmly of the belief that server names should be at least consistent and at most should be able impart a large amount of information at a glance. Information should include:

    - Where the server is
    - What operating system it is running
    - wither it is an application or database server (or a virtual hosting environment server)
    - What the application or system it is running
    - the environment it is for

    This is a tall order, and I have worked many places that have server names like "glasgow1", "glasgow2", "exchange" or "fileserver". I even went through a phase of naming servers "Titan" or "Colossus". This is fine if you have at most 5 servers, but once you get to the data center or multiple data center level you need something more meaningfully.

    All this was knocked out of me when I started working for Merrill Lynch. They have thousands of servers and applications and systems that consist of 70-80 servers at a time and you need to be able to identify servers on your network more easily.

    I grew to like Merrill's naming convention which is:

    > _\[where\]\[virtual?\]\[OS\]\[Application|database\]\[system\]\[environment\]\[identifier\]_

    If you had a server in London that runs on a virtual host with a Microsoft operating system that is an application server for SharePoint in the development environment, and it is the first server you would get \[elon\]\[v\]\[m\]\[ap\]\[sp\]\[d\]\[01\] (elonvmapspd01).

    Lets look at an example where you have 2 web servers, 1 application server and 1 SQL server for your SharePoint production deployment:

    > _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_

    Now add your development, Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing environments:

    > _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14_

    Now, in the intervening time, the company adds a TFS server development environment for testing:

    > _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14_, Glasgow15, Glasgow16

    Do you see the problem. If you now want to add another web server to your production SharePoint it would be "Glasgow17". Oh, and we need to add our TFS UAT environment, and lets not forget a SharePoint disaster recovery environment.

    > _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14, Glasgow15, Glasgow16, Glasgow17, Glasgow18, Glasgow19, Glasgow20, Glasgow21, Glasgow22, Glasgow23, Glasgow24, Glasgow25_

    **Do you remember which server is which? Try and identify a development SharePoint application server? :)**

    This method just does not work in an enterprise environment...

    Why is there not more integration found in Team Foundation Server "out-of-the-box" with SharePoint 2007. It seams obvious to me that you would want to show your Work Items in SharePoint and integrate SharePoint Workflow into Team Foundation Server. It only make sense to be able to initially create a SharePoint Work item that is a request from a user into SharePoint, have some sort of approval workflow before assigning it to a project within [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server").

    I think that [Mike Glaser](http://bloggingabout.net/members/Mike-Glaser.aspx)'s blog [post](http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx) on _"_[_How about one Team Foundation Server portal? I had a dream!_](http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx)_"_ hits the nail exactly on the head. Why can we not view our bugs in SharePoint and create Change requests there?

    What would be excellent would be Mike's hierarchical project space. You should be able to create work items at the root level and then assign them to projects on the way down. This way, user, who have no idea what project a Change Request is for  can create them in the central pool, and then the project manager or technical experts can filter them down into the actual project that the change is for.

    As a start, instead of releasing "Web access for Team Foundation Server" as a power tool, it should have been re-engineered into a set of web parts that can be integrated into SharePoint. That way we could have used the default site, or created our own custom components.

    Microsoft, if you are listening to either Mike or myself...please do not forget the Workflow integration too....

    I recently received a job spec that had the most ridiculous "Required" skill set for an "Analyst Programmer". I though I should share it with you as I have just spent the last 10 minutes cleaning tea out of my keyboard with cotton bud's. Here is how it was presented in the email:

    > _\* C# Java Script Java  
    > \* ASP.NET 1.1 ASP.NET 2.0 J2EE  
    > \* Visual Studio 2003 SOA Visual Basic  
    > \* Winforms Development Visual Studio 2005 Linux  
    > \* SQL Server 2000 (TSQL and Database Design) AJAX Data Cleansing  
    > \* Full Life-Cycle SQL Server 2005 SMS  
    > \* Object Oriented Design Multi-channel CRM IVR  
    > \* Strong verbal and written communication skills Call Centre UML  
    > \* Organisational and problem solving capabilities ISO9000_

    Now obviously this list was formulated by someone who has no idea what these things are, so lets brake that up into a proper list...

    **Skills Required:**

    - C#
    - Java Script
    - Java
    - ASP.NET 1.1
    - ASP.NET 2.0
    - J2EE
    - Visual Studio 2003
    - SOA
    - Visual Basic
    - Winforms Development
    - Visual Studio 2005
    - Linux
    - SQL Server 2000
    - TSQL
    - Database Design
    - AJAX
    - Data Cleansing
    - Full Life-Cycle
    - SQL Server 2005
    - SMS
    - Object Oriented Design
    - Multi-channel CRM
    - IVR
    - Call Centre
    - UML
    - ISO9000

    I can't imagine anyone actually knowing how to do all of these things. If they do, they would only have a cursory knowledge of  each think and be useless at programming any one of these. I could understand this for a Architect or Evangelist role where depth of knowledge is not required. But for a programmer there is a necessity to concentrate on one technology at a time, and only with 2-3 years commercial experience would you be considered "good" at it.

    Whoever this employer is needs to come to the realisation that this is about 5 (or more) roles all mashed together:

    - Architect
    - .NET Developer
    - Java Developer
    - Web Developer
    - SQL Developer

    If I am wrong, please let me know! And if you are one of these "Uber-Analyst Developers" then...well, I don't believe for a moment that you could actually do all of these things well...

    **Advice for an employer:** If you are an employer, only define a list of the absolute essential skills. If you find someone good enough at those, then they can learn the bits and bobs that go with the others.

    **Advice for a job seeker:** If you are a prospective employee, don't lie and say that you know all of these things (I have interviewed my fare share of people who did), but instead say that you know a set of core things, and that you can learn the rest...

    **Advice for everyone:** I am not saying that it is the holy grail or anything, but read [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), many of his articles are just common sense, but other are down right genius (and, no, I am not looking for a job at [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com) ;).

    Especially:

    > - [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html)
    > - [A Field Guide to Developers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html)

    I know a couple of people who have been complaining that Experts Exchange was getting rather slow, and I had noticed the same. So I thought I would investigate how big the pages really are.

    The first test is to save the page "Complete List of Zone Areas.mht" and see how big/ or small it is...Well my jaw hit the floor and here is why:

    [![image](images/ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    What are those guys at Experts Exchange thinking! I know we all have broadband, but this is ridiculous... I am on my corporate network and it is soooo slooow. It is slow from home as well, and that's a 20Mb Cable line...

    Even when you download it as a .htm file it is more than 1.2mb and its mainly the HTML :o And it still locks up IE7 on my Intel duo, 2gb laptop when viewing the page from my HDD.

    The main reason that I am writing this here instead of sending them feedback is I don't have the time to so:

    [http://www.experts-exchange.com](http://www.experts-exchange.com)

    pause - 15 seconds

    Scroll - coz I only get the header on my windscreen display

    pause - 30 seconds

    Scroll more - coz the page is really big

    pause - 28 seconds

    click link- coz I only get the header on my windscreen display

    pause - 15 seconds

    ...sod it, I'm board...

    I have been delving into the black art of SharePoint Branding, and I have been finding it a grueling process. Don't get me wrong it is a vast improvement over SharePoint 2003 and I have already built 2 Features (but not for public consumption yet).

    SharePoint 2007 uses a combination of CSS and master pages to allow the developer to make most of the changes that are required for branding, but it is still just so hard... I am no CSS or html expert so I am relearning skills I have not really used for about 4 years. The last web project I worked on I had the luxury and the privilege to work again with my friend Greg Fyans, who is the BEST CSS, Accessibility and HTML guru I have ever seen.

    SharePoint is predominantly built using tables. Why, I don't know, in this world of CSS, but it is.

    MSDN has a three part article on "[Customizing and Branding Web Content Management-Enabled SharePoint Sites](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa830818.aspx)" which is very informative, but which still lacks lead through. By that I mean that you select and load brands that already exist on the server and only add a single (ish) line of HTML to show how to customize it. This is not quite enough for me, but the articles are very usefully anyway.

    XFN:

    P.S. Although Greg Fyans CSS and HTML skills are beyond guru(Savant I think) his DotNetNuke skills are still being honed: I look forward to seeing his site up again.

    I submitted a trouble ticket about my previous [post](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/10/02/Windows-Live-Writer-Beta-3.aspx) on [http://support.live.com](http://support.live.com) and got a prompt reply from Microsoft support giving me some directions for cleaning up beta bits of my system, and a URL for a direct download:

    Windows Live Writer 2008: [http://g.msn.com/4SAWLWENUS/WriterMSI](http://g.live.com/1rebeta/WLM_en-us)

    Now, this looks good. But when you try to download it you get the "WLMail.exe" install... Dough!

    Guess someone along the line messed up ;)

    When I get the correct link I will post it...

    _UPDATE:_

    _Windows Live Writer 2008 Direct Download:_ [_http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe_](http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe)

    UPDATE:

    But not Beta 3: dough!

    You may have noticed that over the last month or so I have been neglecting my blog (too many personal posts) and my focus on development in general. This has been a temporary setback due mostly to starting a new job and not getting to play with Team Server at the moment (plus I had a knee operation the other week). So for now, I will be trying to focus more on Sharepoint 2007 / MOSS and the feature deficient Sharepoint 2003.

    My new job entails maintaining a heavily customized Sharepoint 2003 deployment and some other nick knacks, while deploying MOSS for the company I am now with. I am quickly expanding my knowledge of Sharepoint from that additional bit bolted onto Team Foundation Server to a more rounded look at its enterprise deployment and integration with other systems.

    I will need to migrate and integrate a number of other applications into MOSS including:

    - Sharepoint Server Portal
    - over 500 team sites in Sharepoint 2003 (Created over time, with no structure...Oh my!)
    - a BI Portal built on Reporting Services and Crystal Reports
    - an extensive intranet that incorporates many Sharepoint like features and an extensive custom workflow system
    - an HR Administration function site

    This is not an exhaustive list, but those applications that I have either found or been made aware of, and it does not by any measure include the future work already being talked about within the company on workflow and automation.

    At least I have some help, a nice guy from New Iberia (Hi Michael!) and a Gal from Chicago who are both currently snowed under with the current work on the systems.

    This should be fun...

    Well, a new version of WLW, [Windows Live Writer Beta 3](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1421.entry), is [available](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1421.entry). Its just a pity that I can't install it. Why do Microsoft insist on writing these bundle application for installing many products at once? I can see the point for home users, but at work you always get something blocked. They should provide the choice of using the bulk installer or using a direct download link. This would allow companies to unblock a specific URL without allowing users to download and install one of the other, **banned**, applications.

    As it is, if even one of the applications in the installer is _**banned**_, then they have to block the whole thing. This is what has happened in my company with \_"WLInstaller.exe", b_ecause it installs Messenger. This punishes the rest of us who want to use one of the other pieces of software...

    As it is, I had to install [Windows Live Writer Beta 2](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1272.entry), from a direct link:

    [http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe)

    It took me about a week, after getting authorization, to get my download capability un-restricted in SurfControl. The Infrastructure team spent a while going back a fourth testing changes to get it working, all the while saying "_It must be IE7!_" or, "_Do you have Office 2007, ah, that's why! If you uninstall it it will work!_" and other assorted rubbish.

    What did it boiler down to? What did they have to do to get it working? Was it permissions? No! Was it IE7? No! Was it Office 2007? No!

    **_They rebooted the server!_**

    Back in March I [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/03/03/Deep_vein_thrombosis_DVT.aspx) about my friend Katie McPherson that died of DVT and her family's [petition](http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=155) calling for the Scottish Executive to [introduce mandatory assessment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7024788.stm) tools for all health boards for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and to get all newborn babies tested for the "Factor V" gene that increases their susceptibility to the condition.

    I would like to share this email from my good friend Steven McPherson...

    > Subject: Update on epetition for my sister
    >
    > _Hi all,_
    >
    > _Just a wee update on the above. Hope you will remember earlier this year you and many others very kindly signed the epetition for changes to the management and protocols for DVT as a result of the death of Katie._
    >
    > _My parents were at the Scottish Parliament today (which they say is a truly horrendous building) to meet with the epetitions panel to discuss this petition further which I am pleased to say went very well._
    >
    > _They were met there by newspapers and a TV crew, before and after they went into the parliament and the news clip can be found here_ [_http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002_](http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002)_. If you wish to see the full 35mins of their presentation within the parliament drop me a line and I can forward this onto you. I am told it will appear on_ [_www.holyrood.tv/_](http://www.holyrood.tv/) _tomorrow under the archive section, although I have a copy of it if this is not the case. Both my parents did very well within the parliament making their points very clear and answering all the panels questions in great detail._
    >
    > _I am aware from my good friend Martin there were also stories on the radio and teletext (of all places) today, covering this. My parents were interviewed by a number of press after the session, so no doubt this will appear in further papers/TV/radio etc tomorrow and over the remaining week._
    >
    > _It appears that at long last we are beginning to make some head way. I believe the next stage is for the epetitions panel to look into the existing guidelines / protocols to establish the current situation and then look into how things can be changed for the future._
    >
    > _I'm sure you don't need reminding but Katie would have been 28yrs old this Sunday._
    >
    > _Main point of this email is to once again thank you for your support. In the end we managed to get 143 signatures for the epetition which is fantastic and would not have been possible without all your support._
    >
    > _Many thanks and look forward to seeing you soon._
    >
    > _Steven McPherson_

    The family have a Website "[http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/](http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/ "http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/")"  where they link to many news stories on the subject and a couple of videos. Although it is too late to sign the petition, please lend your support any way you can...

    Recently I have been having real trouble with Technorati. I have been trying to mop up my loose blog claims and I have been having a problem. Technorati seems unable to get a lock on redirected URL's, I don't see why that would be an issue, but it is. In a effort to try to remedy this problem I have put all of my claim codes here:

    http://geekswithblogs.net/hinshelm [Technorati Profile](http://technorati.com/claim/ij24upgg)  
    http://multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk [Technorati Profile](http://technorati.com/claim/xp8q48qx6)  
    http://www.multidimensionalfreethinker.co.uk [Technorati Profile](http://technorati.com/claim/i9cexgbcr)  
    http://www.hinshelwood.com [Technorati Profile](http://technorati.com/claim/vbgrtargkp)

    The other problem that I seam to have is the TAG cloud that is created seams to contain main invalid tags. By that I mean things that are no tags at all, but page names, or folder names. I am not sure what is going on here, and emailing Technorati support produces no results...

    Ah well, I will see if this works...

    _UPDATE:_

    _Nope, not working._

    Wohoo, I traded my sometimes crashing Xbox 360 in for an Xbox 360 Elite in Saturday. Over the last two weeks I have been playing Bioshock to death, but the crashing finaly anoyed me enough to get it sorted.

    I could either have sent my Xbox away to Microsoft to fix for £150 (no ring of death :() or trade it in for £140 with a couple of games that I do not play any more and get an Elite for £105. it was a no brainer...

    To sweeten the deal, I got Medal of Honor: Airbourn for a tenner and ponied up for Stranglehold, which I have been playing constantly...

    I love my Xbox :)

    Well, its my first day at Aggreko, and I am loving their efficiency...I was handed a laptop uplon entering the office, and they had my login ready :)

    This is the first company that I have worked for that could get this right...

    My first job is researching and deploying Sharepoint, which I will need to come up with a plan for...

    Hmm, I think I [blogged](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/24/Sharepoint-planning.aspx) about that recently...

    They already have a wicked farm setup, but with nothing on it. And there are masses of propriatory workflow and applciations to migrate...Thisis not a small job.

    Well, today I started a new part time job that I do not get paid for, but put just as much professional interest into as may main job.

    I will be moderating the submissions on a really cool site:

    [![](images/myComGetsCredit.gif)](http://www.community-credit.com)
    { .post-img }

    I have just spent my first morning vetting entries, and by and large I have not had to reject very many. This shows that the community that surrounds this site it pretty honest.

    I have had plenty of time today, as I am unemployed this week, and I have managed to get through most of the submissions, well those in English anyway...

    When I get back to the grind, I am sure that I will not have as much time to spend, but I want to do this: I benefit from this community (won a prize last month) and want to give something back.

    You can view the credits I have attained by going to [http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk](http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)

    I was not sure wither I was going to post this, but I am pretty crazy anyway, so...what the hell.

    Last week I interviewed for a job at Microsoft...You might be thinking, "You just got a new job?", and you would be right. But how often do you get to interview for your dream job...not often I think :)

    Well, I had four interviews with Microsoft. As I was starting a new job anyway, they pushed up the timetable slightly. I found out about about the job on a Thursday and went through the usual recruitment things. The job was for an ADC (Application Developer Consultant) in the Glasgow Edinburgh area, but I would have to cover other areas if required. The job spec was specific and pretty cool:

    > _Microsoft Application Development Consultants (ADCs) strive to be the best in software development. Working with cutting edge technologies we play a pivotal role in the delivery of industry leading solutions within the UK’s most prestigious enterprise organisations and software houses._
    >
    > _This is high value technology consultancy. We generate great customer satisfaction from our long term engagement model. This gives our customers the confidence to allow us to become their trusted advisors helping to architect, design and implement their solutions._
    >
    > _ADCs have deep technical knowledge centred on the .NET, Windows and SQL Server platforms. They use this knowledge to improve their customers’ solutions at the highest and lowest levels of the technology stack._
    >
    > _We fundamentally believe that a solid foundation on our platform can form the basis for developing a deep understanding of any of our technologies given the unique Microsoft environment that we work in where we have access to high quality internal training, product groups, beta technologies and our most valuable asset, our people._
    >
    > _Are you someone looking to work within a deeply technical customer facing team to improve yourself, your peers and the Microsoft development community? If so this role could be for you._
    >
    > **_Key Accountabilities:_**
    >
    > - _Work with key UK customers to provide innovative solutions to their development problems, helping to architect, design, implement and test solutions throughout the development cycle._
    > - _Build an ongoing trust relationship with customers by improving their development process and deliverables._
    >
    > _· Delight customers with your technical breadth and depth knowledge, demonstrating a willingness to engage and solve difficult technical challenges._
    >
    > _· Transfer knowledge to customers through effective communication and engagement style_
    >
    > _· Liaise with internal Microsoft communities (such as our development teams in the USA) to represent the interest of customers and drive product improvements_
    >
    > _· Remain technically competent in a broad range of Microsoft products and technologies, selecting areas of expertise in which to explore technologies at their deepest levels_
    >
    > _· Support your peers though deliverables into internal and customer engagements, contributing to an environment for learning and creativity, contributing to others’ success._
    >
    > **_Skills:_**
    >
    > _· In depth knowledge of the .NET Framework and CLR._
    >
    > _· Good understanding of the Windows development platform and SQL Server._
    >
    > _· Development related knowledge of other Microsoft tools, technologies and servers is advantageous._
    >
    > _· Excellent communication skills; ability to deal effectively at all levels within Microsoft ISV and Enterprise Customers._

    This I though was fantastic...So I said so, and that I would be interested in moving forward. They said that they would setup a telephone interview, and call me back.

    Well, after a while (still Thursday) I got a call back to see if I could meet one of their Senior Consultants that night as he was going to be in Glasgow anyway. I though bloody hell, what time.._"How about in an hour and a half"_..Oh shit...

    So after a quick shower and shave I drove (I might not have mentioned that I popped my knee this month and can't drive without being in excruciating pain) out to the hotel next to the airport and had a three hour chat with the Senior ADC from Microsoft. After which I was asked down to Reading...

    Exciting stuff. Until I got the schedule...

    - 12:00 - 13:00 Hiring Manager Interview
    - 13:00 - 14:00 Presentation
    - 14:00 - 16:00 Technical Interview

    Oh man, what do I have to present on? The brief was of a fictitious ISV:

    > _We have used the .NET framework using C# on many successful previous projects and have been pleased with the whole development experience._
    >
    > _For our next project we believe that we have the requirement for some peer-to-peer type functionality._
    >
    > _As a busy customer we have arranged a 15-20 minute presentation slot for you to give to our key developers to give them an insight into peer-to-peer development on the Microsoft [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") platform._
    >
    > _We appreciate that the time slot is too short to cover this area fully but we want to get our key developers some idea of the concepts of this technology and its general usage._
    >
    > _An extra 5-10 minutes will be allocated after your presentation for questions from the audience._

    I have already blogged about how [badly the presentation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/06/Developing-Peer-To-Peer-Applications-With-WCF.aspx) went, but the technical interview was something else as well. I had about an hour on .NET and the rest on architecture.

    The technical bit was going fine until they started asking questions on CLR, which I know the basics of, but the details I did not, so what did they ask? CLR, CLR and more CLR.

    Suffice to say that CLR was critical to getting the job, so I didn't. They did however give me loads of advice on what to do to get it in the future. Here is what I will have to do...

    - Learn all about the CLR, everything...
    - become a better public speaker...
    - have lots more practice at architecture...

    So not a total loss. I have learned where my knowledge is deficient and how to rectify it...not a NO, but a NO for now...

    Well, I have not done one of these is a while...I could say that I have been busy, but I have not been :)

    I have been finishing up at Merrill Lynch in lue of starting my new job at Aggreko, and as I finished up on Friday, and I don't start till Monday, you could say that I am currently Unemployed. If only for a week...

    After my [woefully presentation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/06/Developing-Peer-To-Peer-Applications-With-WCF.aspx) last Monday and my lack of knowledge on CLR, I have vowed to rectify the defect in the depth of my knowledge. This will not be hard, but I will need to re-buy the CLR book that I had as it was returned to ML along with all of the books I bought for my [MCPD training](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx).

    Well, in the last month (yes I know I said I would do this every week) I have:

    - [upgrade](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/13/A-new-day-a-new-week-a-new-Team-Server.aspx) a server from [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") 2005 to TFS 2008 Beta 2.

All of which I had had during my deployment to the same infrastructure...
    - started reading about [Sharepoint and BizTalk](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/19/Studying-for-the-new-job.aspx), although I have to confess I have not got far through the books...

    # Handling Team Foundation Server Events

    Because of the lack of support for [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") in the Team Edition for Architects I will be replacing all of the auto-generated services with [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") services. But as it turns out this messes up everything, so I have started from scratch and I will post all of the code for doing this without the Architect bit.

    The first thing that you need is the Contract for Team Foundation Server event handling. This is very specific and only works if used accurately:

    > ```
    > Imports System.ServiceModel
    > Imports System.Runtime.Serialization
    > Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server
    >
    >     ''' <summary>
    >     ''' This is the service contract for integrating with the Team Foundation Server notification events.
    >     ''' </summary>
    >     ''' <remarks></remarks>
    >     <ServiceContract(Namespace:="http://schemas.microsoft.com/TeamFoundation/2005/06/Services/Notification/03")> _
    >     Public Interface INotification
    >
    >         ''' <summary>
    >         ''' The Notify method if fired whenever a subscribed event arrives.
    >         ''' </summary>
    >         ''' <param name="eventXml">This XML defines the data that was changed on the event.</param>
    >         ''' <param name="tfsIdentityXml">This XML identifies the Team Foundation Server the event came from.</param>
    >         ''' <param name="SubscriptionInfo">Information about the subscriber</param>
    >         ''' <remarks></remarks>
    >         <OperationContract( _
    >                         Action:="http://schemas.microsoft.com/TeamFoundation/2005/06/Services/Notification/03/Notify", _
    >                         ReplyAction:="*" _
    >                         )> _
    >         <XmlSerializerFormat( _
    >                         Style:=OperationFormatStyle.Document _
    >                         )> _
    >         Sub Notify(ByVal eventXml As String, ByVal tfsIdentityXml As String, ByVal SubscriptionInfo As SubscriptionInfo)
    >
    >     End Interface
    > ```

    This code allows you to capture TFS events and we will be using by reference only. If you have been having trouble handling the events then look know further than here for [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") as this has been tried and tested.

    The real trick for handling TFS events in [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") is that all the events come into the same routine. It would be nice if SubscriptionInfo listed what event it was, but alas it does not. So you may be thinking that you need to parse the XML and find out what type of event it is. Well you can if you want, but I find it easer to have more than one endpoint for the same service. You can then parse the URL for the event type, which is way easier than the XML as the events are all different.

    The first thing you need to do is create a project to hold the code. In the spirit of expedition, I have created a "[Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") Service Application" to hold all of the Notification service code. But in the real world you would keep the Contract and Implementation classes in different assemblies.

    [![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    Now we have the project, you can add the INotification class and the Notification service. I like to keep all of my services in a "v1.0" so that I can add other services in new versions without affecting the current version.

    [![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    Once you have your INotification class looking like the code extract above we will add a default implementation and test the service. The default implementation should look like:

    > ```
    > Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server
    >
    > Public Class Notification
    >     Implements INotification
    >
    >     Public Sub Notify(ByVal eventXml As String, ByVal tfsIdentityXml As String, ByVal SubscriptionInfo As SubscriptionInfo) Implements INotification.Notify
    >
    >     End Sub
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > ```

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    This class just implements the INotification contract (interface) and has an empty Sub for the notify method that will be called when an event is fired in TFS.

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    The config file will contain a definition of the service as well as two endpoints for the same interface. The services and behaviours occur within the <system.serviceModel\> tags.

    > ```
    > <system.serviceModel>
    >   <services>
    >    ...
    >   </services>
    >   <behaviors>
    >    ...
    >   </behaviors>
    > </system.serviceModel>
    > ```

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    This is the really important part of getting the service working, and goes between the <services\> tags. The first part of the service configuration contains the service definition. Here we define the name of the service, which should be the same as full namespace and class name of out implementation, the behavior configuration name (we will look at this is a bit) and the endpoints.

    > ```
    > <service behaviorConfiguration="NotificationServiceBehavior" name="RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.Notification">
    >     <endpoint address="WorkItemChangedEvent" binding="wsHttpBinding" contract="RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.INotification"/>
    >     <endpoint address="CheckInEvent" binding="wsHttpBinding" contract="RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.INotification"/>
    >     <endpoint address="mex" binding="mexHttpBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange"/>
    > </service>
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    In a service hosted within IIS there is no need to set a base address as the location of the .svc file sets this for us. In this case it is [http://localhost:\[port\]/v1.0/Notification.svc](http://localhost:[port]/v1.0/Notification.svc). The "mex" endpoint allows other application to discover the capabilities of the service.

    The other two endpoint point at the same contract and are in fact implemented by the same method in the service implementation. These two endpoints have different addressed so that we can tell team server to send events to different URL's but use the same code to process the events. You could add any of the TFS events in to this list of end points, but it is best to keep the names the same as the event being fired as we will detect it later. We are using the wsHttpBinding as the most advanced that TFS will support.

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    You only need to set two options on the service behavior, the httpGetEnabled needs to be set to true for the WSDL and the meta data to work. This allows the discoverability of you services. The includeExceptionDetailInFaults option allows the diagnosis of faults when we test the service.

    > ```
    > <serviceBehaviors>
    >     <behavior name="NotificationServiceBehavior">
    >         <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="true"/>
    >         <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true"/>
    >     </behavior>
    > </serviceBehaviors>
    > ```

    The service behaviors go between the <behaviors\> tags and are named the same as the services behaviorConfiguration attribute.

    We now have a working service and can test it by starting a new instance of the web application and going to the URL of the .svc file. You will see a page like:

    [![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    This shows you how you can connect to the service, but as this will only be connected to by TFS it is not a requirement for just now. What is important is to see the URL's for the two endpoints that we have created. If you click the WSDL URL ("[http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc?wsdl](http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc?wsdl)") you will see the generated meta data for the service.

    I am not going to display the full WSDL here as it is huge, but here is the important section for what we need to look at:

    > ```
    > <wsdl:service name="Notification">
    >   <wsdl:port name="WSHttpBinding_INotification" binding="tns:WSHttpBinding_INotification">
    >     <soap12:address location="http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChangedEvent"/>
    >     <wsa10:EndpointReference>
    >       <wsa10:Address>http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChanged</wsa10:Address>
    >       <Identity xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity">
    >         <Upn>comuter1user1</Upn>
    >       </Identity>
    >     </wsa10:EndpointReference>
    >   </wsdl:port>
    >   <wsdl:port name="WSHttpBinding_INotification1" binding="tns:WSHttpBinding_INotification">
    >     <soap12:address location="http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/CheckInEvent"/>
    >     <wsa10:EndpointReference>
    >       <wsa10:Address>http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/CheckIn</wsa10:Address>
    >       <Identity xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity">
    >         <Upn>computer1user1</Upn>
    >       </Identity>
    >     </wsa10:EndpointReference>
    >   </wsdl:port>
    > </wsdl:service>
    > ```

    This section of the WSDL highlights the service definition and the two endpoints that exist. We are now able to get TFS to send events to this service. To do this you need to add the URL's of the end points to the notification system within TFS. This is done by using a command line utility on the server, or by calling parts of the TFS API. For ease we will call the command line, but a future version should probably have a user interface to allow the administration of which TFS servers you want to handle events for.

    To subscribe to the events you will need to use the BisSubscribe utility which you can find out how to use [here](http://olausson.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,d9948138-262e-4db0-94f1-4f0a033b0fb0.aspx), or you can use the API and provide an interface to add and remove subscriptions.

    If you call:

    > BisSubscribe.exe /userId **TFSEventHandler** /eventType **WorkItemChangedEvent** /deliveryType **Soap** /address http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChanged

    Using the untility you will subscribe to events using SOAP, or if you call:

    > ```
    > SubscribeEvent(tfsServer, "TFSEventHandler", "http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChangedEvent", DeliveryType.Soap, Schedule.Imediate, EventType.WorkItemChangedEvent)
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    Using a API helper class similar to the one below:

    > ```
    >     ''' <summary>
    >     ''' Helper methods for subscribing to and from events
    >     ''' </summary>
    >     ''' <remarks></remarks>
    >     Public Class SubscriptionHelper
    >
    >         Public Shared Function SubscribeEvent(ByRef tfs As TeamFoundationServer, ByVal userName As String, ByVal deliveryAddress As String, ByVal Type As Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.DeliveryType, ByVal Schedule As Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.DeliverySchedule, ByVal EventType As EventTypes, Optional ByVal Filter As String = "") As Integer
    >             Dim eventService As IEventService = CType(tfs.GetService(GetType(IEventService)), IEventService)
    >             Dim delivery As DeliveryPreference = New DeliveryPreference()
    >             delivery.Type = Type
    >             delivery.Schedule = Schedule
    >             delivery.Address = deliveryAddress
    >             Return eventService.SubscribeEvent(userName, EventType.ToString, Filter, delivery)
    >         End Function
    >
    >         Public Shared Sub UnSubscribeEvent(ByRef tfs As TeamFoundationServer, ByVal subscriptionId As Integer)
    >             Dim eventService As IEventService = CType(tfs.GetService(GetType(IEventService)), IEventService)
    >             eventService.UnsubscribeEvent(subscriptionId)
    >         End Sub
    >
    >     End Class
    > ```

    I may write an article in the future on this, but all the code is part of the current [TFSEventHandler](http://tfseventhandler.codeplex.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk) application.

    We now want to determine what sort of event has been raised in the Service implementation. To do this we need to parse the URL of the endpoint that has been raised and retrieve the event type.

    > ```
    > Dim UriString As String = OperationContext.Current.EndpointDispatcher.EndpointAddress.Uri.AbsoluteUri
    > Dim SlashIndex As Integer = UriString.LastIndexOf("/")
    > Dim EndieBit As String = UriString.Substring(SlashIndex, (UriString.Length - (UriString.Length - SlashIndex)))

    > ```
    >

    As you can see it is just a case of parsing the URL to get the last bit after the final "/" and then converting it to an enumerator.

    > ```
    > Public Enum EventTypes
    >     Unknown = 0
    >     AclChangedEvent
    >     Branchmovedevent
    >     BuildCompletionEvent
    >     BuildStatusChangeEvent
    >     CommonStructureChangedEvent
    >     DataChangedEvent
    >     IdentityChangedEvent
    >     IdentityCreatedEvent
    >     IdentityDeletedEvent
    >     MembershipChangedEvent
    >     WorkItemChangedEvent
    >     CheckinEvent
    > End Enum
    > ```

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)The enumerator lists all of the events that are possible in TFS, but be warned that not all of the events fire effectively. Once you have the event it can be converted into an object. I use code from [Howard van Rooijen's TFS Project Template](http://blogs.conchango.com/howardvanrooijen/archive/2006/04/29/3894.aspx "Howard van Rooijen's TFS Project Template") for the event objects and [Larry Steinle's CustomXmlSerializer](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/CustomXmlSerializer.asp) code to convert the XML to Howard's objects resulting in the following code:

    > ```
    > Dim IdentityObject As TFSIdentity = EndpointBase.CreateInstance(Of TFSIdentity)(tfsIdentityXml)
    > Dim EventObject As WorkItemChangedEvent = EndpointBase.CreateInstance(Of WorkItemChangedEvent)(eventXml)
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    All of the objects are now ready to pass over MSMQ to the TFS Event Processor, which will be the subject of the next article in this series...

    I recently had the need to create and deliver a presentation on [Developing Peer-To-Peer Applications With WCF](http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx). Although the technical content was good, my delivery was not. I got stage fright...

    As I approached the room to give the presentation in which I expected to see a couple of people, I was horrified to hear a clamor of voices, no, a venerable din of idle conversation coming from the room. _Not that room, please..._ but that was indeed the room, and I had to give my presentation to more than 25 highly technical people...It was fortunate at least that I had a copy of all of my notes, as my mind (what little was left after a day of traveling) dribbled slowly out of my ears...

    I had previously [presented on VSTS](http://skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/self.aspx/Public/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System/VSTS%20Presentation.ppt), but that was to a room of coworkers that somehow seamed less threatening. In addition I knew the content back to front and did not have any notes anyway. The 45 minute [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") presentation ended up taking 3 hours.

    So, needless to say, I ended up having to almost totally read from my notes. Not the best way to do a presentation...

    Anyway, here it is...

    [http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx](http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx "http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx")

    I owe a lot of thanks to the authors of [Pro WCF: Practical Microsoft SOA Implementation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-WCF-Practical-Microsoft-Implementation/dp/1590597028) without which I would not have been able to put the presentation together in three days at all.

    I am just writing some handover documentation for our [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") deployment in the office. Thank goodness that I wrote installation and disaster recovery documents when I originally deployed the system, other wise this would have been a very long process.

    All I really need to do is reference those documents in a wrapper document that details of all of the servers and any online resources that I use.

    TFS 2005 is a pain to install, but it is just fine to manage and over the last 8 months I have only had to log onto the server 3 times with one of them being to configure TFS 2005 to work with Sharepoint 2007.

    I would always rather a painfully install than painfully management...

    When I posted my question "[Would anyone be interested in Hosted TFS?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/46649-1363184 "Would anyone be interested in hosted TFS?")" on linked in I was hopping for a response from potential users. I did not think that [Jim Lamb](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimlamb/archive/2007/05/30/hosted-tfs-pilot-program.aspx "Microsoft does indeed listen") would be reading it and blog about Microsoft's internal ambition to have a hosted model for [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"). I have been quite excited about this subjects as I have worked for many companies that would find the cost of running an internal TFS server prohibitive, but for whom a hosted option would be perfect.

    To date there is only one hosted option and that is from [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/), if you are interested in hearing more about them then you should read their [blog](http://tfsnow.wordpress.com/2007/07/29/announcing-tfs-now-a-hosted-tfs-service/ "microsoft does indeed listen").

    Now, if you wanted to setup and offer Hosted TFS yourself, well, you can't. The licensing for TFS as the moment does not allow it but Microsoft is currently looking a this and we can probably expect to see something in this space some time in 2008/2009...

    If you are wanting space on a TFS server, but not an actual server (usually because you have only one or two projects) you will have to wait until Rosario before these features will be available. It seams that TFS 2005 and 2008 are both impractical for this model, but Microsoft is looking to solve these problems in Rosario to allow multiple companies (clients) to share a single TFS instance.

    In the hopes that some one is still listening there are a number of things that TFS requires to be more marketable, and not just for Development projects:

    - RAG reporting needs to be built into TFS for management reports
    - There needs to be a higher level of reports that can be used cross project
    - Some targeted presentations would be good (i.e. targeted at Project Managers, or Test Managers, or program managers, or just plain management.)

    I think Paul Slater will be posting a more detailed list, but you get the picture. There is not lacking in features for developers, testers or architects, but the ones that sign are paychecks and the budget for TFS are non technical management with little imagination...

    I would like to thank [Paul Slater](http://geekswithblogs.net/MMaI/Default.aspx) for his incite into the black art of "Marketing TFS" and [Jim Lamb](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimlamb) for continually answering stupid questions...

    I have been asking one of my colleagues for information on Sharepoint and how to deploy it to large organizations. He intoned that he new how not to do it and pointed me towards a particular [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/04/09/investing-in-logical-architecture-design-samples.aspx "Sharepoint planning") that defines a very effective deployment method.

    In reading it I came to a much grater realization of not only the power of Sharepoint, but the scale that it can be deployed in. Although you have to take the entire potential architecture into consideration, I really like the MySites part of the deployment.

    I think I am going to enjoy the Sharepoint thing...

    After my post on the new [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) search engine a fellow by the name of [Anselm](http://www.searchcrystal.com/) pointed out [Search Crystal](http://www.searchcrystal.com "http://www.searchcrystal.com"), another visual search engine that produces some good result. I did not get he same Wow that I did from Tafiti, but the amount of information that is provided through the interface is extensive.

    You can change the display of the results from Cluster (the default) to Spiral and list. I did find that the List option is very confusing and difficult to navigate, and the Spiral option seams of limited use to me personally. It was a good idea to use the cluster view as the default and I think they have put the most work into this part of the system.

    All in all, it is very good, but I think that from a visual perspective the Tafiti interface works better, al be it with only one search engine.

    Below you can see an example of the search results, and you should be able to play with it. This does indeed work on Virtual Workstations, while the tree view from Tafiti has some problems due to the slow refresh.

    Have you seen any other search visualization website's? Let me know...

    Something I have noticed in writing an [article](http://www.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/archive/2007/08/21/TFS-Event-Handler-in-NET-3-5-Part-1-The-Architecture.aspx) is that the "Application diagram" in VS2008 does not support [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation"). This I think is an oversight even for Beta 2. Is this going to be in the RTM, I hope so as it would be virtually useless without it!

    I have decided to have a little go at creating a Team Foundation Server Event Handler in .NET 3.5 that is resilient and scaleable. I will be using as many of the features of Team Suit as I can, but bear with me as there are a few things that are new to me.

    I have decided to have a little go at creating a Team Foundation Server Event Handler in .NET 3.5 that is resilient and scaleable. I will be using as many of the features of Team Suit as I can, but bear with me as there are a few things that are new to me. I am going to create everything under source control in CodePlex.

    3. TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 3 - Passing the events over a Windows Communication Foundation MSMQ (Coming soon)
    4. TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 4 - Workflow (Coming soon)

    # The Architecture

    The first toy I am going to play with is the Team Edition for Architecture components of Team Suit. This will hopefully allow me to create a system that has a bit of foresight and planning associated with it. I have played with these features before, but I have not, up until now, used them in battle.

    I have created a blank solution in my TFS Event Handler Codeplex project, so it is time to create the "Distributed System Diagram" that I will use to define the architecture of the system.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb-19-19.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image.png) When you create the diagrams they are added to the Solution and not a specific project. These diagrams will be linked to the code that we will eventually create allowing us to view these diagrams even if we have made changes. They will update automatically with any  architectural changes that I have made after coding had started.

    { .post-img }

    The logical place to start is with the Application Diagram, and this is highlighted by default. The other diagrams are usefully as well. The Logical Datacenter diagram will allow you to assign parts of the application to different servers and control the communication between these servers. The System Diagram is used to define logical systems that communicate with each other.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_2-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    You get a number of diagrammatic options in the toolbox. The Applications section list all of the types of applications that are going to be in your solution and represents the projects that are going to be created under your solution. If you add a Windows Application for example, you will get a windows application project within your Visual Studio solution. It is worth noting that there is no need to think about "individual projects like what assemblies am I going to need", or "how will I arrange my namespaces" at this point. All we are interested is the main building blocks of the application.

    ## Application Diagram

    The first application that I know that I am going to need are Web Service applications to handle the incoming events from Team Foundation Server and a web service that will allow us to configure any options for this part of the system and the subscriptions to team servers.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_3-13-13.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_3.png)
    { .post-img }

    Now that I have added a web service you can see that it is just a different type of Web Application. This will need some configuring to be what we want. I have chosen to only handle two of the events that TFS throws, WorkItemChangedEvent and CheckInEvent. There are many other events that could be handled, but these two are probably the most common.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_4-14-14.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_4.png) [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_5-15-15.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_5.png)
    { .post-img }

    The completed service looks quite simple, but we now need to configure it to allow it to work effectively. If you leave everything as defaults you end up having a hundred things to change later, so it is way better to get it out of the way and polish it at this stage.  There are different setting available for each application and endpoint type, so the best thing to do is to look though all of the options and se what is what. You can see from the image right that I have configures all of the options on the service end \[point and I repeated this on all of the endpoints. Many of these setting are used when we generate the code at the end of this process.

    The second application is the decision service. It has a MSMQ service endpoint called EventReciever that the notification service passes all of the events that it has received to. This service will then execute all of the events against the Workflow service that will perform any activities associated with the event. The reason for the EventReciever service is to make the system more robust. Because the EventReciever is a MSMQ service the Notification Service can still send messages to it even when it is down.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_6-16-16.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    The final end point to add is a web based administration system for the workflow system. I have added all of the links between the applications that define the communication between the services. The ability to create these diagrams is not limited to being done at the start of the process, you can add this diagram to any solution and it will have all of your applications and links defined already. This is because there is a direct link between the solution and the diagrams. You can change either and affect both with the change, and this does not just apply to these architecture diagrams but to the Class diagrams that are part of Team Edition for Development.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_8-17-17.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    With the application diagram done, I can now do an number of things. One of which is to "implement All Application" which will build my main projects for me.

    What I am going to do first is take you though the "Define Deployment" and "Design Application System" options to get a better understanding of the capabilities of the system. Before I can do this, I will need to create a Logical Datacenter diagram to define what infrastructure is available, namely a single server that may or may not be the same server that Team Foundation Server is installed on.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_9-18-18.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_9.png)
    { .post-img }

    In creating the Logical Datacenter I realized that I had made a mistake in my diagram of the system and I had not allowed for the additional web interfaces for the application. I have updated the diagram to reflect the problems I encountered. The diagram now has a separate web administration application that talks to both of the main admin services to get information and to make changes to the way that the system operates.

    It has two web end points, one for administering the workflow in the event handler and the other for administering the subscriptions for the notification service.

    This is one of the best advertisements for this way of working as you spot more of the mistakes at this point and not half way through coding.

    ## Logical Datacenter Diagram

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_10-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    The logical datacenter diagram is very simple for this application as I want it to run initially in a single server environment. At the moment I have no need for a database, but it can easily be added to the system at a later date, I could even separate out the services from the website without having to change much of anything as far as the developers are concerned, it just impacts the architects.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_11-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_11.png)
    { .post-img }

    The options that you get are mainly self explanatory, you can add "Zones" which are your firewall areas and put your servers with these areas. You can then add endpoints and their links through the firewalls to show how communication occurs. You can add all of your firewall rules into the system so it more readily replicated your network.

    For this application I only have one zone and one line of communication as all other communication takes place on the server.

    You could have a much more complicated infrastructure, but for this application it is unnecessary.

    ## Deployment Diagram

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_13-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_13.png)  [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_19-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_19.png)
    { .post-img }

    The deployment diagram allows you to place all of you applications onto the diagram so you can define the  communication lines and determine wither the applications can talk to each other in the desired way.

    In this case we only have one Zone and one server with HTTP inbound for the web sites. You can see from the diagram that I have added all of the applications to the one server.

    ## System Diagram

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_14-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_14.png) [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_18-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_18.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you have a complicated system with more than a few applications you will want to brake up the diagram into manageable Systems that you can see the input and output of the system. You could say that there is a Core system that contains the web services and that only two of the web services are accessible outside of the system. If you add the applications to a System diagram and right click on a web services you get the option to create a "Proxy endpoint" that sites at the edge of the system but is linked to the main service.

    I can now create a From End System diagram that has the website and only a definition of the Core system without any of the internal components.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_15-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_15.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can see the result in the diagram to the left. In much larger system it allow your to view the components and the interaction of the components from a variety of differing angles to see how the whole thing interacts.

    ## Implementation

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_20-11-11.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_20.png)
    { .post-img }

    The last part of this is to initiate the implementation of all the application that I have created. This will create the projects under a solution that can then be used to build the final application.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_21-12-12.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_21.png)
    { .post-img }

    As you an see, without doing any code or creating any projects within VS manually I have a full solution. That is my job as the architect over, unless there are any changes from development. This would not be handed over to the developers for completion.

    NOTE: I have found that using this method you can only create ASMX services, and not WCF. This will hopfully (PLEASE) be sorted for RTM of Visual Studio 2008.

    I just had to pick my jaw up off the floor. What made me gawk! [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) that's what.

    [![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_1.png)

    Tafiti is a new search front end from Microsoft, it is still in beta, but what a beta. I think you would need a reasonably good computer to run it, but from a dyslexic persons point of view it is revolutionary. Although it does not give you the complete ability to search visually, it goes a long way to achieving it. Hopefully many other people will find it as equally usefully as I do...

    What do I like so much about it you may ask... Well...

    [![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb-5-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    I love the way you can select what type of data to view from the search, there is a little spinning widget at the bottom left of the screen that you can use to view only feeds or web among other things. It is easy to use and extremely obvious what each button does (I think some hallway usability testing went on here).

    [![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_2-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    I love the way you can pile up search terms on top of each other and then get back to your previous search with ease.  Although it could do with a way to flip between them...There is a way to filter your searches even further to tweak the results.

    [![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_3.png)
    { .post-img }

    I love the way that you can save searches in your never ending search for what you are looking for. You can even add labels, although I have not worked out what they are for yet, but I am sure that it will be cool.

    All that in itself would be good, but the best is yet to come. This is the bit that makes this a must use for all dyslexic people all over the world (well in English speaking countries so far).

    [![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_4-4-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    The screen shot does not really do it justice, but this is an fantastic way to search the web. I have been doing some searching and, so far, I have been able to find exactly what I was looking for very quickly. Even obscure things we easy to find. This gets the thumbs up from a Scottish dyslexic software developer, and I can't wait to email the link to everyone. I have to thank [Larry Larsen](http://on10.net/Blogs/larry/first-look-microsoft-tafiti/) for pointing this out to me, and I hope the [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) team have even more cool search help up their sleeves.

    I will be keeping my eye on this and I hope that even after continued use I am still using it as my main search engine: Oh, I just thought, we have Virtual Workstations in the office and I will need to see if it even works on them: I know that video, flash and big Powerpoint presentations do not.

    I have been tinkering with VS2008 for a week now, but I had not had time to really look at it.

    They have made the interface slicker, and faster making the whole experience a little nicer.

    [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb-7-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    When you go to create new projects you get a number of nice options that allow you to target multiple versions of the .NET Framework with a single IDE. This will be of real advantage to those companies that still want to use .NET 2.0 while still evaluating 3.0 and 3.5.

    [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    It should come as no surprise though that you will need to upgrade any existing projects to the new solution and project specifications in VS2008 so unfortunately you will no longer be able to open your projects in VS2005 after the upgrade has completed.

    If you use Team System, you should baseline your projects first as the upgrade process disconnects you from source control and you can't reconnect it. Hopefully this will be fixed for the RTM, but it could well be something we will need to live with for the change over.

    As you switch between the framework options the list of possible projects changes and you can see what has been added, but not the updates to functionality.

    [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_2-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_2.png) [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_3.png) [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_4-4-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    The screen shots above gives you an idea of what will be available for the different frameworks for Windows.

    In the [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") section though I got a pleasant surprise as they have added some workflow options to the list of services you can have. I assume that these are nice shortcuts to have, but that you could produce the same thing manually.

    [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_5-5-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_5.png)
    { .post-img }

    The addition of the Syndication Service Library is a nice touch though.

    One of the things to watch is that even if you cerate an application that targets .NET 2.0 and add a Setup project to the mix, you will need to manually change the prerequisites from .NET 3.5 to .NET 2.0 yourself as .NET 3.5 is the default.

    [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_6-6-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    This is only mildly annoying as the .NET Framework 3.5 installer will automatically install .NET 2.0 if it is not there already. Once VS2008 is in RTM I think I would leave it set to the default, that was there is only one big install and you know that when you start using .NET 3.5 features you will only have a small install to go.

    If you are connecting to a Team Foundation Server you will still need to install the "Team Explorer" client as it is not included. Personally I think it should be included in all versions of Visual Studio as standard, but I think it is likely that we will continue to be required to install it separately.

    One of the really nice features in VS2008 the the ability to debug and step through JavaScript! I think I just heard your jaw hitting the floor! That's right, you can debug JavaScript. Oh for this feature 5 years ago...

    If you are trying to get team server to talk to another Sharepoint farm this is something to watch out for. I fell into this one myself, and now my American colleagues have hot the same problem (I have changed things like server, account and company names to protect the, erm, servers?). The key things to look for in the log file are the creation details:

    These details will help you debug the error. As you can see above there are details for the Sharepoint portal to be created and the location of the Sharepoint sites. Check the actual error message which is always buried  in the log file:

    From this message I have highlighted the meaningfully parts in bold. These are the things that will help you identify the problem and rectify it. In this case the Team Foundation Server Project Creation Wizard is trying to create a sub site under what it thinks is a managed path of [http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/](http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/).

    Now the default setup for Sharepoint is that there is a managed path called "Sites" that sits under the main directory and this is the default for creating sub sites using [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"). But in this case there is already a site created in Sharepoint called "Sites" that is a portal to the other sites in Sharepoint including site maps and the like. (try your equivalent of [http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/](http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/) to see what is there. You will also need to check the Sharepoint Administration site for the settings. To do this you need to go to the Sharepoint Administraion site:

    { .post-img }

    And click on "Application Management" and then on "Define managed paths".

    [![image](images/TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    You should then see a list of the defined managed paths for the particular application (1) and you can change the application that you are looking at (2).

    [![image](images/TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    What needs to be done is to choose a new managed path as this one is taken and to add it to the Sharepoint server. Make sure that you check the server for sites of the same name, you could use "TFSProjects" so as not to get an overlap.

    Once you have added this Managed Path you will need to modify TFS to create sites under that path. To do this please refer to my previous post "[Team Foundation Server Error TF30177 : Team Project Creation Failed](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/14/Team-Foundation-Server-Error-TF30177--Team-Project-Creation-Failed.aspx)" which tells you how to update the project references.

    Well that's it, debugging team server errors is fun, but not for the faint hearted...

    Instead of using the proxy generation features of Visual Studio you can create a custom proxy in .NET 3.0 to handle all of your needs in a more maintainable manor and with less code. This method works best when you have access to the interfaces that created the service.

    Here is an example:

    > ```
    > Namespace TeamFoundation.Proxies
    >
    >     Public Class TeamServersClient
    >         Inherits System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase(Of Services.Contracts.ITeamServers)
    >         Implements RDdotNet.Proxies.IClientProxy
    >         Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers
    >
    >         Public Sub New(ByVal callbackInstance As System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext, ByVal binding As System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding, ByVal remoteAddress As System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress)
    >             MyBase.New(callbackInstance, binding, remoteAddress)
    >         End Sub
    >
    >         Public Sub AddServer(ByVal TeamServerName As String, ByVal TeamServerUri As String) Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.AddServer
    >             MyBase.Channel.AddServer(TeamServerName, TeamServerUri)
    >         End Sub
    >
    >         Public Function GetServers() As String() Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.GetServers
    >             Return MyBase.Channel.GetServers
    >         End Function
    >
    >         Public Sub RemoveServer(ByVal TeamServerName As String) Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.RemoveServer
    >             MyBase.Channel.RemoveServer(TeamServerName)
    >         End Sub
    >
    >         Public Function ServceUrl() As System.Uri Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.ServceUrl
    >             Return MyBase.Channel.ServceUrl()
    >         End Function
    >
    >     End Class
    >
    > End Namespace
    > ```

    Because your classes implements the service's interface when that interface changes you will be notified in Visual Studio that this has happened. This is a boon during development as changes can happen often.

    This particular class is a duplex proxy, so communication can go both ways. You can download the source code for this from [here](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/SourceControl/DownloadSourceCode.aspx?changeSetId=8644).

    I thought I should take a leaf out of [Scott Dorman's](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/15/About.aspx "About Scott Dorman") book and post some information about me:

    - [About Martin John Hinshelwood](http://blog.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/archive/2007/08/20/About-Martin-John-Hinshelwood.aspx)
    - [Martin Hinshelwood's Resume](skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Public/Resume)
    - [Martin Hinshelwood's LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)
    - [Martin Hinshelwood's Community Credit](community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)

    I have tried to be concise, but I am sure that knowing some of the people that read my blog, I will get complaints. One of the reasons that I am posting this is that there is another Martin Hinshelwood who is the manager of Albion football club, and he gets a higher search engine ranking than me: My mission in life is to relegate football (Soccer for you Americans \[What is with American football anyway? Why all the pads? We play a similar game called Rugby without all padding! Much more satisfying.\]) in relation to my name a distant second to technology.

    Ahh well, Scott is a much better writer than me, or he just has more patience...

    I am sure that I will adapt it over time to better reflect my experience.

    I will be [starting a new job](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/16/A-change-for-the-better.aspx) in around a month and I wanted to get up-to-speed with the technologies that the new company want to be using. To start with I have had a look at a number of certifications:

    - [Technology Specialist: BizTalk Server 2006](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/biztalk/)
    - [Technology Specialist: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Application Development](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/spservices/appdev/)
    - [Technology Specialist: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Configuration](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/spservices/config)

    These will be on top of the [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx) exams (all 5 of them) that I have already started studying for. Although this is a tall order, I will be buying these books as an added encouragement to myself to get off my lazy arse and read them:

    For BizTalk I bought:

    [![](images/5109rhmfwCL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU02_AA240_SH20_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470046422/202-0028303-9793477 "Professional BizTalk Server 2006") [![](images/51BPxhyOIXL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU02_AA240_SH20_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590597788/202-0028303-9793477 "Pro WF, Windows Workflow In.NET 3.0")
    { .post-img }

    The reason for the WF book is that, with the impending release of BizTalk 2006 R2, support for WF and [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") will be part of the application.

    For Sharepoint 2007:

    [![](images/41CXXm-gRQL._AA240_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623201/202-0028303-9793477 "Inside Microsoft Windows Sharepoint Services 3.0")
    { .post-img }

    I know that this is not a MOSS book, but you need to start somewhere and there are no exams for MOSS yet, too new. Although I have asked to be put on the beta list for Sharepoint 2007, MOSS 2007 and .NET 3.0 exams...

    Well, that's me in my last month at [Merrill Lynch](http://www.ml.com/) after a nice run as a developer. My reasons for moving I have [stated](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx) before, but I have decided that the contractor business is just too risky for me at the moment.

    So I have accepted an offer from [Aggreko](http://www.aggreko.co.uk/)! They have managed to woo me with their culture of embracing new technology that even the highest echelons of the company promotes with their insatiable appetite for new things.

    I think that this will be a pivotal move for me that will allow me to expand my expertise in the areas that I am interested in (Sharepoint, [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"), .NET 3.x, and others) as well as work with many like minded technofiles.

    I will let you know how I get on, but for now I have a months notice to work and many handover documents to write!

    When you create your first project, you may get an error during the creation process. When you look at the log file and see a "proxy error" message detail it may be to do with the way that TFS installs.

    I  many large networks you can't connect to the server in the browser if you use the server name. This is because the proxy server is checking DNS for the name and unless you get every server in your company added to the proxy PAC file, you will get an error. To see if this is the issue try putting the server name into the browser:

    http://myServerName.

    If you get the error then you should try the FQDN:

    http://myServerName.myInternalDomain.com

    If this work then you need to change the URL's within TFS that it uses to define these calls. You can check what the current settings are by:

    1. Open http://tfs01.uk.company.com:8080/Services/v1.0/Registration.asmx in your browser.
    2. Click on GetRegistrationEntries.
    3. Then click on Invoke.

    Save (or just view) the resultant XML so you can have a look at it. There are two section of importance here. One is the Reports section which will look like:

    > ```
    > <RegistrationEntry>
    >   <Type>Reports</Type>
    >   <ServiceInterfaces>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>BaseReportsUrl</Name>
    >       <Url>http://[serverName]/Reports</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>DataSourceServer</Name>
    >       <Url>[serverName]</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>ReportsService</Name>
    >       <Url>http://[serverName]/ReportServer/ReportService.asmx</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >   </ServiceInterfaces>
    >   <Databases />
    >   <EventTypes />
    >   <ArtifactTypes />
    >   <RegistrationExtendedAttributes />
    > </RegistrationEntry>
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    The second is the is the WSS section that is in the same format.

    Now, we have established that \[serverName\] will not work so we will have to update TFS with the new details. To do this you need to:

    1. Create an XML file called RSRegister.xml with just the xml above.
    2. Modify the server name from \[serverName\] to the FQDN of the server and save it.
    3. on the TFS server you need to open a command prompt and execute the following:
       1. `iisreset /stop`
       2. `cd "%programfiles% Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation ServerTools"`
       3. `TFSReg.exe RSRegister.xml [yourDataTierServerName`\]
       4. i`isreset /start`
    4. Then call the web service above to make sure that the settings are correct.

    You can repeat this for the WSS (Windows Sharepoint Services) section.

    All done and TFS should work. Although it is worth noting that in my company environment I could then no longer create projects from the TFS App server itself as \[serverName\] works but the FQDN did not. Typical...

    I have just finished upgrading out [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Development environment to TFS2008 and I have to say it was a totally painless procedure...

    The installation handles the upgrade perfectly (hopefully the RTM will work just as well) and I even created a new project with Visual Studio 2005, nice...

    I now need to look at the Sharepoint integration and I will probably need to write a custom web service for Sharepoint to get the integration to work [how I want](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/20/Solution-to-sub-sites-in-Sharepoint-3.0-with-Team-Foundation.aspx).

    Ah, well. At least I get to play with 2008!

    I was reading Mike Tautly's post on SkyDrive so I thought I should have a look.

    I found it extremely easy to use and solves the problem of my blog not supporting file uploads.

    I have a link to my [SkyDrive](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public) on the left of my blog and I have uploaded my first public file, my [CV](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/Resume). I will add more files in the future...

    What I would like to see on the SkyDrive is more Sharepoint style interaction so I can edit my files directly on the online drive.

    Rather than confuse the issue with my verbal dexterity (or excrement from my brain is more likely) I will quote from a source on the web:

    > [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") is an inherited condition. Researchers have determined that a gene on the short arm of chromosome #6 is responsible for [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking"). That gene is dominant, making [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") highly heritable. It definitely runs in families.
    >
    > [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") results from a neurological difference; that is, a brain difference. People with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") have a larger right-hemisphere in their brains than those of normal readers. That may be one reason people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") often have significant strengths in areas controlled by the right-side of the brain, such as artistic, athletic, and mechanical gifts; 3-D visualization ability; musical talent; creative problem solving skills; and intuitive people skills.
    >
    > In addition to unique brain architecture, people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") have unusual "wiring". Neurons are found in unusual places in the brain, and are not as neatly ordered as in non-dyslexic brains.
    >
    > In addition to unique brain architecture and unusual wiring, f/MRI studies have shown that people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") do not use the same part of their brain when reading as other people. Regular readers consistently use the same part of their brain when they read. People with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") do not use that part of their brain, and there appears to be no consistent part used among dyslexic readers.
    >
    > It is therefore assumed that people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") are not using the most efficient part of their brain when they read. A different part of their brain has taken over that function.

    As a result of this dyslexic children often start with a lack of  [phonetic awareness](http://www.dys-add.com/define.html#Phonemic) that impairs their ability to learn in school. Teachers assume that this phonetic awareness exists and thus the child is at a disadvantage before they even start learning.

    I hope from this you can see that although dyslexic people start with a disadvantage caused by the way we are taught in school, if they manage to get past that hurdle then the tend to end up with an advantage in the long run...

    Some of my colleagues in New York have been working on deploying Team Foundation Server as a change management system and they ran into a little error while installing to the QA (UAT) environment.

    > _Log file excerpt:_
    >
    > 08/08/07 10:59:33 DDSet_Status: Process returned 2336

    >
    > MSI (s) (E8!88) \[11:19:18:364\]: Product: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server (services) - ENU -- Error 28936.TFServerStatusValidator: the Team Foundation Server ServerStatus Web service failed with 404 HTTP NotFound status. Verify that Internet Information Services, Windows SharePoint Services, and ASP.NET are configured correctly and that ASP. NET v2.0 Web Service Extensions are allowed . For more information on troubleshooting this error, see the Microsoft Help and Support Center.

    [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") installed to a point and then through a "28936" error along with a "404 page not found" (I had these [symptoms](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/03/19/TFS_Gotcha_server_name.aspx "TFS Gotcha server name") before but a different cause). This occurred when TFS runs some checks after installing the web services. It try's to call http://server:8080/Services/v1.0/ServerStatus.asmx and can't get access to the URL. There was access to http://server:8080/services/ but when you try to access http://server:8080/services/v1.0 we got the 404.

    I tried reinstalling ASP.NET, I checked permissions on folders, I tested asp.net and html from the services physical folder (Program FilesMicrosoft Team Foundation Server/Web Services/Services/). I pulled my hair out...

    Then I asked the 6 million dollar question, "Has an IIS lockdown been performed"...

    As it turns out the default company server build (sadly we buy source code for windows and cripple change things before deployment) contains an ISAPI filter on IIS called "URLScan" that does some sort of URL jiggery pokery that ultimately stops TFS from working.

    Remove this, and the error goes away!

    _This is from memory, I will fix any memory lapses tomorrow...Fixed_

    I had spotted these updates last night in a [post](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/2007/08/07/windows-vista-pre-sp1-performance-and-reliability-updates-released.aspx "Windows Vista Pre-SP1 Performance and Reliability Updates Released") by [Robert McLaws](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/) and decided, what the heck, I'll give it a go...

    I had no trouble installing the updates, but they do take a while and require a reboot, but when Vista started again I could see that it was running faster than the normal fresh boot.

    Now, I am running vista on my Laptop, which is old, not very old, but old none the less. It is of the Dell flavor and has only 1GB (upgraded) of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card. It can be Sloooow.

    Now, thanks to the updates, its faster, leaner and meaner! All the better to run Visual Studio 2008 with...

    [Steve Clements](http://geekswithblogs.net/steveclements/archive/2007/07/26/114182.aspx "Becoming a better developer...") has tagged me (thanks Steve) about how to become a [better developer](http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx), he thinks tagging me 'would make an interesting read'..Hmm, no pressure:

    - **Actually study for my** [**MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer**](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) **like I said I would.** I [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx) earlier in the year that I was going to study for my [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) and that I was going to start with [Exam 70–536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation. Well I got 80% through the book, got board, and stopped... I even managed to get my company to buy me all of the books for the MCPD and they are just sitting on the shelve at home. I have tried to kid myself that the reason I failed was that the books are heavy, _well they are_, but that is no excuse, _well maybe not a good one_... So I resolve to pull my finger out and get reading...
    - **Create a final version of my [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler system.** If you read my blog, you will know that from time to time I work on a little project on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") called the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler). I have a working prototype up, but I need to get my finger out an finish it. I will need a more powerfully laptop though, which leads me onto...
    - **Get a better laptop.** I have been humming and hawing about getting a new laptop, one that can run TFS in a VPC. The fact is, I have no room for a desktop in my house and a laptop powerful enough for my needs will be about £3000... Which I don't have...
    - **Blog about "what have I done lately".** I recently [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/04/Blogging-about.aspx "what I have done lately") about what I had been doing during the last couple of weeks as I though I had not been doing much. But once I started the post I found the list of things I had been looking at, working on and subjected to just kept getting bigger. I endeavor to keep up my weekly, or biweekly update if nothing else...
    - **Explain [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") and its benefits to a developer to anyone who will listen.** I have started [blogging recently](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/23/What-is-dyslexiaAgain.aspx "What is dyslexia Again") about what it is like to be dyslexic and how it affects my work, both for the [positive](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/22/How-to-become-a-Multi-Dimensional-Free-Thinker.aspx) and the [negative](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/06/Why-I-think-VB.NET-is-a-better-choice-than-C.aspx). Doing this will hopefully encourage not just budding dyslexic programmer, but anyone in jobs that require problem solving, lateral thinking, or _architecture_. I may be going down to London to speak at a company conference to [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") on disability, so I think that would cover it...
    - **Join a user group.** I am not sure if this would make me a better developer, but it should expose me to more developers at the same level as me. I have not met many developer who have the same avid interest in technology as me. Many developers seam to think that being a developer is _just_ a _**career**!_ Perish the thought, its more than a career, its an adventure...

    Well I think that I am done...yes, I'm done...Now all that is left is to tag some people. I think I would tag Sandy Cormie and Ajay Patwari if they had blogs, but I will tag [Jason Franks](http://geekswithblogs.net/jasonfranks/archive/2007/08/12/Better.Dev.aspx) because he makes me laugh, [Mickey Gousset](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/) because TFS is cool, and [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/) because he is an inspired speaker who can also write code...

    The reasons I think that VB.NET is better than C# are many, but I will try to put some of them down in a coherent manor unlike the usual C# developer that can only come up with "[vb is a language for mediocre programmers...anyway looks ugly and smells ugly..](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/05/114415.aspx#140605)" (Hmm, he must have thought long and hard to come up with that).

    **Reason 1 - Business sense**

    liviu is right that many mediocre programmers are VB programmers. This is because VB is easier to read and easier to code, thus there are actually many more VB.NET programmer than C# in the world, so ov course there are more mediocre ones, statistics demand that. But this is its advantage, you can have a superb developer produce your application, then have on of the mediocre programmers maintain it. This keeps costs down for the business, and frees up the superb programmers time to work on the next complex project.

    **Reason 2 - Visual sense**

    The readability of VB.NTE is what makes it more popular. Take these pieces of code for example:

    ![](images/image_thumb.png)
    { .post-img }

    or (thanks [Mihir Solanki](http://www.mihirsolanki.com/) for the timely translation)

    > NorthwindDataContext ctx = new NorthwindDataContext();
    >
    > var query = from c in ctx.Customers  
    >                   where c.Country == "UK"  
    >                   select new { Name = c.ContactTitle + " " + c.ContactName };
    >
    > foreach (var c in query.Skip(2).Take(3))  
    > {  
    > Console.WriteLine(c.Name);  
    > }

    Forget for a moment that the VB is nicely formatted, this looks pretty similar. There are the same number of lines. The same amount of text. But I find the VB version easier to read as it is more logical, it flows better and you can read it much more effectively.

    But this is just personal preference.

    **Reason 3 - Disability friendly**

    VB.NET unlike C# is not case sensitive. I have always wondered why in this day and age that C# is still case sensitive. It seams to me that this is a historical thing, but it just avoids confusion and makes you code more readable if "variable" and "Variable" and "vaRiable" are the same thing and not different.

    If you are [dyslexic like me](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/23/What-is-dyslexiaAgain.aspx) then this is very confusing as although "r" and "R" are difficult to confuse, "v" and "V" is the same letter, only slightly bigger. This means that you code is more accessible and disability friendly if you do not have case sensitivity.

    **Reason 4 - Intellisense**

    Oh how I love intellisense, the joy to have all of your code write itself. In effect this makes the argument of C# being more concise mute, as your code almost writes itself.

    **Reason 5 - Dynamic checking**

    Using VB.NET I do not need to wait till compile time to see if I have any typos or errors in my code and the "write-time" compiler for VB.NET checks my code as I type. As a dyslexic who can write the same work six times in the same object differently and not be able to see the difference you can imagine how helpfully this is.

    Would you like Word to only check your spelling when you try to save, and refuse to save until you had fixed it? I think not...

    **Reason 6  - Personal**

    I don't know if it is a symptom of my dyslexia, but curly brackets ({ and }) give me the heebie jeebies and I find I am unable to see where one method, or loop ends and the others begin. If it is part of my dyslexia then that is an even better proponent of VB.NET over C# and should be added to reason 3.

    **Conclusion**

    Although the use of VB.NET over C# is a personal preference it also has many advantages. The more noted of which is Readability, disability friendly and 'write-time' code checking. With all this it is actually faster to write in VB than C#.

    Lets all try to make our code more accessible and use VB.NET.

    P.S. I don't know what I am doing wrong, I can't seems to 'smell' any of my code, neither VB.NET or C#. Hmm...

    I am very encouraged by [Brain Harry's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/07/24/update-on-adoption-of-tfs-at-microsoft.aspx "update on adoption of tfs at microsoft") on [dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfooding) at Microsoft. In my battles to get my company to use Team Foundation Server I recently contacted the manager of the most highly regarded development team in the company.

    Apart from being initially disheartened by his initial question "Does it run on Unix?" the manager of the team's main reservation was that he is always dubious about a product from  Microsoft that they do not use internally...

    Obviously he has not had much exposure to [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") otherwise he would know that Microsoft now has 21 instances of TFS running for its internal development teams with a total of 734 projects and 5,600 users.

    Now that is around 10% of all Microsoft employees, which is quite impressive for a product that has been out less than two years.

    This internal use seams to be encouraging Microsoft to put a lot of effort into this product and Service Pack 1 was released within a year and version 2 ([Orcas](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/) or [Visual Studio 2008 Team Foundation Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/)) will be available by the end of this year, with version 3 ( [Rosario](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/08/04/rosario-august-ctp-released.aspx "rosario august ctp released") or Visual Studio 20XX Team Foundation Server) to follow.

    The future is bright, the future is [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System")...

    I have [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Hosted-Team-Foundation-Server.aspx "Hosted Team Foundation Server") about Hosted Team Foundation server before and I have had a few discussions with [Jon Pratt](http://blogs.msdn.com/ukvsts/pages/jon-pratt.aspx) from the [Microsoft UK Development Tools Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/ukvsts/default.aspx) on the subject. The issue with Hosted [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") is that there is no real partitioning of projects within the system and thus if you had two clients on the same server they would be able to view each others data.

    I even asked a [question](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/46649-1363184?browseIdx=0&sik=1186315050351&goback=%2Eahp%2Eamq) on LinkedIn and got an amazing response.

    You may think that this is an oversight, but TFS was not really designed for the hosted environment. The problem is that in my company we would need to keep different areas of the business separate. This requires separate instances of Team Foundation Server for this to work.

    There are changes coming in Orcas that will help with this and ones in Rosario that should solve the problems and allow proper hosting.

    At this time there is only one commercial hosted team server called [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/) that has been blogged about by [Jeff Beehler](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/07/31/hosted-tfs-available-from-readify.aspx "hosted team foundation server") and [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/07/30/the-first-commercial-tfs-hosting-service-is-live.aspx) last month.

    Why is it that vendors insist on developers staying up all night to write installation documentation for a 40 component on 19 server installation? Do they not realize that this is not the best way to have your documentation produced? What about the image that it presents to the customer, or the impact of someone actually following said documentation!

    That has been one of my tasks over the last week. I stalling a complex enterprise solution from documentation written at four in the morning by a very tired developer. Needless to say it has been difficult and my copy of the documentation is now full of notes to take back to the vendor. Notes like "What is this?" or "Which config files are you referring to?" and "In the config file I can find, what 'exactly' do I need to change?"

    It does not help that the application is not complete...

    We are trying to follow cryptic documentation for an application that is not complete to install two instances with four environments per instance and twenty servers per instance and as many as twenty-five applications per server!

    Hmm... Fun.

    In my company it is the job of someone in business technology to manage production applications. Personally I think that this is a job for a Project Manager, not a developer, as it is about management and is not particularly technical. You do not actually have to carry out any of the work on the application, just:

    - Manage the relationship with the vendor
    - Manage the infrastructure teams to keep the application running
    - Manage all issues and problems with the application
    - Manage any updates to the application
    - Manage all access to the production system
    - Manage any documentation for the system and its operation
    - Manage SOX audits on applications that require it

    This is no small task and incorporates only part of my job. When everything is well, there is little to do, but as usual everything happens at once.

    I currently own:

    - Our general ledger application (soon to be decommissioned)
    - All of our Mortgage Souring systems (around six applications)
    - Visual Studio Team System (includes Team Explorer, Web Access to Team System, Office Integration, )
    - a CRM that I built
    - and a few others

    I am performing a SOX audit on our general ledger application and all of our Mortgage Sourcing application have stopped working due mainly to the way they are built being incompatible with our infrastructure.

    Fixing these problems, or managing the solutions is slow and painfully. At least my company has just implemented a SOX audit management system that is taking the audit from two months last year to only a few weeks this year.

    I just got a comment from Reto Winter to let me know about a [post](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/08/03/creating-custom-avatars-a-microsoft-tool-and-others.aspx "Creating custom avatars") regarding a new [Microsoft Avatar service](http://cartoon.msn.com.cn/) on MSN China, so as I am sitting here writing some posts anyway, I will have a look. It is in the same vain as the [Southparkify](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/31/Southparkify--Simposonize--better-with-both.aspx) and [Simpsonize me](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/30/Simpsonize-Me.aspx) options that I have blogged before.

    **Here is how it works**

    First, learn Chinese...or just click buttons until it works, like me..

    Click the start button

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_9-23-23.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_9.png)
    { .post-img }

    You will need to install an application called MSN Cartoons Beta (which is the middle button) and then click next (the bottom button) and install the active-x component.

    The next task is to upload a picture to create the avatar from. To do this chick the folder on the right.

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb-24-24.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    Once you have a picture uploaded, and you have highlighted your face, as you can see I am not photogenic!

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_2-16-16.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    You need to click the build picture button.

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_1-15-15.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    You will then be presented with a "select your face type" option

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_3-17-17.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_3.png)
    { .post-img }

    and once you have selected this you get a partial cartoon

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_4-18-18.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    To move onto the next stage you click the next button again

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_5-19-19.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_5.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can then select your emotion, hair and glass from the options

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_6-20-20.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    and the next button again

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_7-21-21.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_7.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can then save either in 98x98 or 252x252

    [![image](images/CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_thumb_8-22-22.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingCustomAvatars_147F7-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    An you are done!

    Here are my pictures, but I am not sure how much they look like me!

    This week I installed Office Mobile 2007 on my Windows Mobile 6 ([Black Shadow](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/21/Windows-Mobile-6-Black-Shadow-4.0.aspx)) SPV M3100, and I have to say, what changed?

    I can now see my RSS Feeds as part of Outlook Mobile 2007, but apart from that the only change was the addition of OneNote Mobile 2007.

    I had already installed OneNote to assist with my note taking in the Office as my [writing sucks](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/22/Memories-of-a-multi-dimensional-free-thinking-software-developer.aspx). OneNote also syncs with the desktop version and I could not now do without it.

    It is good that this is a free update...

    The biggest vindication of your .Net developer status would be if Microsoft wanted to employ you! And it happened to me...

    I recently blogged about maybe being [interested in a career change](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx), and [Siddharth Bhatia](http://blogs.msdn.com/sbhatia/default.aspx), a Group Program Manager from Microsoft posted a [comment](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx#138860 "Siddharth Bhatia comment") asking to get in touch.

    We had a lengthy conversation that ended in him asking if I would be interested in a position in Redmond. I should note that he did not at any time offer me a position as there is a lengthy process at Microsoft to get to that stage.

    Obviously I said yes and he got one of his development managers, [Scot Gellock](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/04B/946), to email me and go through the preliminary's. This is where we ran into a problem...a Visa problem.

    As I understand it, I would require a [H1B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1B_visa) vista to work in the US. These are in limited supply, start only on 1st September and it it too late to apply...

    I am not giving up on this, but there are few other options...

    If you want to have you city displayed in the HTC Weather Home screen then you need to do some editing!

    My colleague Ajay just purchased a HTC Touch yesterday from Orange and he was upset that Glasgow was not listed in the cities.

    Now, I have a SPV M3100 with Black Shadow installed so I though that they way I fixed mine would work... But no, you need to do some registry hacking to get it to work on the HTC Touch as the file you need to change is on the ROM and not in an editable part of the phone.

    HTC Touch instructions: [Local weather on the HTC Touch](http://blog.commsconsulting.co.uk/2007/07/26/local-weather-on-the-htc-touch/ "Local weather on the HTC Touch")

    If you have a Black OS / Other HTC: [HTC Homeplug Weather fix - get your LOCAL weather! CAB files now available!](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=319187 "HTC Homeplug Weather fix - get your LOCAL weather! CAB files now available!")

    The registry edit is easier if you have an official Touch, but I was able to simply edit the xml file and save it without any extra complicatedness...

    [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/) has just [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/07/30/team-system-web-access-power-tool-available.aspx "Team System Web Access Power Tool Available") the release of Team System Web Access the next incarnation of DevBiz's TeamPlain product.

    I have just completed installing it on our development servers and I like it. It has much nicer features than TeamPlain 1.0 and is much more stable that 2.0RC.

    I still have the old long project name problem:

    [![image](images/2788dc67eeca_9897-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2788dc67eeca_9897-image.png) 
    { .post-img }

    But I already have a [solution](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/04/02/TeamPlain_Revisit.aspx "TeamPlain Revisit") for this, but it will probably need some modification, although I have confirmed that it works just fine with 2.0RC.

    There is still the problem of not being able to go directly to a work item from an external link and this will prohibit us going into production with this. I did raise this on the Microsoft Forum for TeamPlain, but maybe it is a bigger issue.

    [![image](images/2788dc67eeca_9897-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2788dc67eeca_9897-image_1.png)
    { .post-img }

    I use my [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler to send out an email to anyone a work item is assigned to, which could by anyone in the company (75,000 users) but in reality only those on the project get emails. The email notifies them that they have been assigned a Work item, but the link does not work with either "TeamPlain 2.0RC" or "Team System Web Access".

    I think that this form of access will not become popular until an Enterprise version of TFS is released and business users can access without a CAL.

    Just found a new services from Microsoft called [Soapbox](http://soapbox.msn.com/). It is similar to YouTube, but I assumed it would be implemented using [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/). But as it turns out, its Flash! Boo....

    [Video: The Fish Diet](http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=6f9ee93f-ab6e-481e-99dd-9652a4671804 "The Fish Diet")

    Looks good and works through our firewall though!

    Well, I now have Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit [installed](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/29/Installing-the-.NET-Framework-3.5-Beta-2-on-Vista.aspx "Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 on Vista") on my laptop, but I have just realized that Team Explorer is not provided as part of the installation (same as VS2005). This is irritating as now I need to download Visual Studio 2008 team Foundation Server to get the client out of it.

    I think that Team Explorer should be included as an optional install for Visual Studio, this would help at work as well as we need to rationalize and package (a 2 month process) every piece of software. If Team Explorer was available as part of the installation of VS2008 then I could avoid extra hassle.

    I will get back to you once I have VSTE installed...

    As you may have seen from my previous [post](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/27/Installing-Visual-Studio-2008-Beta-2.aspx "Installing Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 on XP"), I have just installed VS2008B2 onto my old work computer, well it is now time to hit my Vista laptop with it:

    I just tried to install Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit on my Vista laptop, but it failed on the first hurdle; installing the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2

    After an hour of searching the web for answers and trying about three different options, finding about ten more, and getting increasingly frustrated, I gave up for a while...

    On my second attempt I managed to find a solution: I switched to trying to install the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 on its own because it starts quicker than the full Visual Studio install process.

    **The Solution**

    In order to install the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 on Vista I had to uninstall some previously installed Hotfixes using these instructions:

    > 1\. Open the Control Panel, select Programs & Features, click on the “View installed updates” located on the Tasks pane. Select and uninstall the following Windows updates:
    >
    > \- Hotfix for Microsoft Windows (KB110806)
    >
    > \- Hotfix for Microsoft Windows (KB930264)
    >
    > \- Hotfix for Microsoft Windows (KB929300)
    >
    > 2\. Reboot
    >
    > 3\. Reattempts installing .NET Framework 3.5.
    >
    > [From MSDN Forum post](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1705630&SiteID=1&pageid=0#1734475 "Re: [ ERROR ] Can't install .NET Framework 3.5") by [Gus Perez](http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/)

    I did however find more that one hotfix with the same KB number, so I got rid of them both.

    After this I tried VS2008 again...

    The first problem I have encountered in that in the past I have had various version of Office 2007 beta and other bits and bobs. You will need to remove these to install Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2.

    If your install fails on or just after "**Microsoft Web Designer Tools**" then you probably have this problem. If you download the [Windows Installer Cleanup Utility](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301) you will be able to clean anything that is Office 2007 and beta from you system.

    This worked for me, but I guess you may have other problems...

    I am going to test this on my spare work computer and my laptop at home, but at home I will need to remove Vista to free up some RAM.

    I want to be able to test Team Foundation Server 2008 as well, but I will need to wait for a new laptop for that...but I spec'ed one out on Dell and it came to £2900.

    **Does anyone have a really kick ass laptop? Where did you buy it?**

    I think that the min speck needs to be:

    4GB of RAM - I need to be able to run Vista with Team Suit + VPC with Windows 2003 & [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server")

    17" screen

    Min resolution of 1900+

    **Any ideas?**

    In the modern era networking is not just the preview of business men. There have been many sites created over the last few years but they only seam to implement one or maybe two if the strategies for providing either a community or business networking site. A [list of social networking sites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites "list of social networking sites") can be found on Wikipedia.

    The problem with the current [social networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) is that you need to set all of them up separately, and although they provide ways to import your contacts it is time consuming and is prone to error if your contact details are out of date.

    What we need is a central contact, connection and linking system that all of these sites can communicate with to update their details. Such a system would, of course, require to be secure and have the ability to partition the data so that it only pulled information on people who are registered for the calling site.

    If it used CardSpace (or similar) to authenticate users then users could be identified whatever community site they were using. To add to security the core service could provide components, or a client infrastructure that could pull back data and present it without the community site being able to skim it, allowing users to invite their friends from other networks to other specialist networks. This way if a user updates their email address on one service it is updated on them all.

    I have started a [Community Foundation](http://www.codeplex.com/RDdotNet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Community%20Foundation&referringTitle=Home) to provide this but it is still in the early stages, and honestly, the amount I have learned in the last few years, would require a sever refractor.

    If I coupled this with some of the more recent features I have been working on a service could be created that would provide a hosted community service that would provide a Framework for any community site (all right, only the ones in .NET).

    In this way some of the more complicated, but usefully services provided by social networking sites would be much easier to implement for fledgling services.

    I will need to think of some sort of pricing model tough... Hmm, maybe [Paul Slater](http://geekswithblogs.net/MMaI/ "Paul Slater's Blog") can help; if he ever posts to his blog!

    _A possible pricing model:_

    - _A service access charge  +_
    - _Per user cost: with the cost per user being divided between all the services that a particular user uses +_
    - _Per transaction charge for communicating with the service_

    _This model may be complicated but would be fairer to smaller sites, while still charging more for small sites that have a high number of transactions._

    Over the past week I have been working on creating and documenting a deployment process for our new main business application. This application is very complicated and requires twenty servers per four environments. We need to track and control deployment to UAT, pre-production, production and C&R (disaster recovery site), but my company as a larger organization only requires control of production.

    Now at the moment all the deployments are done by the vendor and is done by updating Assemblies on various servers, then running a custom tool that updates the config files based on the version of the assembly that has been updated. All database updates are currently done manually, and I rather doubt that there is any pre scripted rollback for the schema changes.

    I have been tasked with coming up with a solution that allows us and not the vendor to easily update and rollback any deployments necessary. Now, this project has been one of those "Of-The-Shelf" products that has required eight months of "configuration" (I can configure any system with Visual Studio too) and is not yet stable.

    The application is made up of over twenty components that exist on multiple servers over multiple environments and soon over multiple instances.

    Once it is stable however, I would like to see the vendor providing their updates the same way that any major application is delivered:

    - The Major Release (v1.0 to v2.0) + rollup of all Service Packs and Hotfixes
    - the Service Pack (v1.0 to v1.1) + rollup of Hotfixes
    - and the Hotfix (v1.0 to v1.0.1)

    If it works :) then we will be able to do deploy any number of instances of the solution and be able to replicate any version of the solution.

    I want the vendor to provide MSI or EXE's for all releases of each of the components, but the rollback function must be implemented religiously. This will reduce the risk in any deployment as it currently takes two to three days to do a clean build of the application. It should also force the vendor to invest in the quality of their application, because if any of the installations or rollbacks go wrong in the Dev environment then we will "return to sender" for a recheck or rebuild.

    **Has anyone ever tried to get their vendor to do this?**

    **Has anyone been successfully?**

    [Jeff Julian](//geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/) who kindly provides my blog has been [blogging](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2007/06/22/113388.aspx "SharePoint Content Request | What would you like to see?") about what features would be good in Sharepoint.

    I would like to see all of the capabilities of TeamPlain for Team Foundation Server built into Sharepoint. With versions for both technical and non technical people.  
    This would allow a much more versatile integration of [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") into ones own intranet and allow the use of TFS for other things than just development...

    The current capabilities of TFS are sorely under utilized as any system that uses a process flow can be integrated with it: From a Ticketing system to hotel service desk. If you are tracking information and want to see how you are performing then TFS can provide a solution.

    At the moment the licensing model is prohibitive for this, but with an enterprise edition of Team Foundation Server _likely_ to be in the works ;) I would think that this would change...

In it he explains why we want to use software factories and he provides a nifty storyboard to get across the ideas.

    This sort of work will go a long way to making software factories more accessible, and push the understanding of the need for Software Factories to the next level.

    Plus, I like the pretty pictures...

    [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") is many thing to many people, but it always involves reading. Some people are heavily dyslexic to the point where the are unable to function at all in normal schooling. Many people think of [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") as a disability, but the only time I think of it that way is if I can get something:

    - Free laptop, Dictaphone and other things at university.
    - Extra time in exams (in the UK it is 15 minutes for every hour)

    The rest of the time I use my [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") as a gift!

    It would be different if I did not work with computers. With spell check at least all of the words are spelled correctly (if not always the correct word), but in the real world, it is the ability to get your point across that is the big advantage to [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking"). Dyslexic people have a very high level of Oral skills and coupled with the ability to visualize things in three dimensions it is a boon to anyone.

    The three dimensional visualization is one of the reasons that spelling and working with words is a problem. Take the letters "b", "d", "p" and "q": A non-dyslexic will see four different letters, but I see a single letter that is at four different orientations. Mirror a "b" and it becomes a "d", and many time I can't see the different between these letters.

    Despite this I can actually read very fast, around a hundred pages in an hour of a novel. This is because I have developed the visual compensation of reading the shape of the words and not the word itself.

    **You wlil fnid taht you are sltil albe to raed tihs txet qiute elsiay eevn tuhgoh I hvae jbuelmd the ltetres auonrd, as lnog as I keep the fsirt lteetr and the lsat leettr in the smae plcae.

    This is how dyslexic people see the words that are written on the page, and why they are so poor at spelling.

    I thought I should blog about my gift and how it has impacted my skills as a software developer. I want to do this for a number of reasons:

    - To help other so gifted developers
    - To help employers of so gifted developers
    - To help me get a better understanding of how it affects me

    I will add more, but for now here are a couple of resources to get you started in understanding:

    All you have to do to become a multi-dimensional free thinker is to change the way you think of your dyslexia. The benefits of having dyslexia far outweigh the negatives: The concepts of multi-dimensional thinking are incredibly difficult to learn if you have not been born with the ability, and if you are dyslexic, you have.

    The advantages of Multi-Dimensional thinking is that you can visualize problems from all different angles and provide a solution that would not have occurred to a linear thinker. Although [Sigmund Void](http://www.sigmundvoid.com/?p=75 "The gift that keeps giving.") mentioned three dimensional thinking, the capability of thinking in more than three dimensions can assist you enormously if you are a software developer.

    I am not saying that all dyslexic people can think in more than three dimensions, but they are all **capable** of it: not everyone is...

    The advantages of being a Free Thinker are also incalculable. It adds a creative element to the way your brain works and makes incredibly complex ideas seam simple. The disadvantage is getting others to understand you, but this is off-set by dyslexic people usually having superb oral skills.

    Professions for such talented people include but is not limited to:

    engineers, architects, designers, artists and craftspeople, mathematicians, physicists, physicians (esp. surgeons and orthopedists), dentists, it professionals (esp. Software Development Engineers, Developer Evangelists and Software Architects).

    With my lack of time to work with TFS at work in anything but a server maintenance and user assistance role, or even any sort of Visual Studio work, I will need to find a way to continue to access and work with Team System.

    The other problem is that the only current hosted TFS solution is CodePlex and the guys at CP, in an effort to reduce load, have disabled almost all of the functionality.

    I will need to get up and running at home. This will allow me to hone my TFS skills and improve my knowledge even better than at work as I can do anything I need to the server.

    Well in my current war to get my company to use [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"), I am loosing the battle for Visual Studio Team System adoption. I have fought many battles, against Jira, Confluence and Subversion, but they are currently wining. I cant seam to get the Architecture & Strategy guys to get behind the project. They are sitting on the sidelines encouraging me, but with no active participation.

    Time and again I am running up against the problem that no one will read any of the content that I have provided. It is difficult to fight a battle on many fronts and the fact that Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server is such an excellent product with complete integration between all of its services is actually not working in its favor.

    Others are able to concentrate on selling Jira to one group of people while others are concentrating on selling Subversion. I have to lobby them all...

    The call has now come down from on high to have all Risks and Issues stored in Jira. This will cripple the effectiveness of my arguments as the best arguments for the business revolve around Work Item Tracking, as they don't really care if the developers can link their source code to tasks, or test results to Releases or even bugs to Change Requests.

    Thus, I have created a [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") project for [TFS Work Item Tracking to Jira Synchronization](http://www.codeplex.com/TfsWitToJiraSync) in the hopes that some enterprising developers would be interested in working on the code. I will not have time to work directly on the code as all development projects are now being outsourced to our Indian development team or to external companies, and I have been relegated to the bench of release management  documentation...

    With a new baby, new mortgage rate and declining job satisfaction I am getting that itchy feeling in my feet. There was a time that I was allowed to Code for a living and not just support applications and document deployment strategies. I have ended up filling my free time with my love of Coding and now, with the new baby, I find that my free time is drying up.

    My current thoughts are to expand into the field of contracting. That way when I get board I can just not renew my contract and find some greener pastures. The reason that I have not done this is the past is fear! Fear of having no income; fear of starting something new. I feel that it is time to bite the bullet and get on the Money ladder like 50% of my coworkers...

    To that end I have been asking about and it seams that the going rate for a bog standard developer is around £300 per day... My, that would be nice. And I would hope that I am no bog standard developer! How many developers are already up on .NET 3.0, Team Foundation Server and Sharepoint 2007. How many developers are familiar with large scale deployments, enterprise architectures, disaster recovery and software factories.

    I have turned down contracts before for a lot more than £300 a day, purely on the basis that they are a hundred miles up the road and I don't like to commute... Well I have decided that is someone again offers me a 9 month contact for £650 a day, I will take it. I may not like being away from home, but I like my bank balance even less! And even the lowest rate would be double my salary...

    Is anyone out there on the look out for a Senior .NET Developer with the skills I have listed? If so, _ping_ me (see, learning the management jargon as well) and maybe we can take it _offline_ and discuss the _space_!

    **How did you get into contracting?**

    I would be interested in finding out if anyone is using the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) I created on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"). The main reason for this is to solicit feedback for the process and integration capabilities.

    The [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler removes the need to integrate with the Team Foundation Server events. It provides a simple API for making decisions on what to do with event that are raised.

    I am looking for the answer to the following questions:

    1. Did you get it installed?
    2. Did the configuration instructions provide enough information?
    3. Did it start successfully?
    4. Did it work as you expected?
    5. Are you even interested in another version?

    **Let me know!**

    Well I just got through simplifying my blog categories! I just though they were, well... rubbish,  and there were too many of them. I have toned them down and added a full description for them all with links to the relevant Wikipedia pages...

    I have simplified the article categories as well...

    Suggestions for Julian:

    Can we not get the number of posts or articles to appear next to the category?

    And what about a friendly category URL?

    How about the digg this links on the blog pages as well as on the main feed?

    Just some thoughts! Don't ask, don't get.

    I have been thinking a lot recently about the future of software development and where I see it going. I have worked for seven companies since leaving university (two design studios, two software studios, one community startup, one Internet bank and one investment bank), and my conclusion is that all of the SSADM (Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodologies), or Development Lifecycle, that I learned in university does not work in the real world. Yes, if you can charge your customers two million for an intranet that you will deliver over two years you can do what you like, but these days your customers business moves too quickly for this to work. A solution that was started last year, or the year before in my current company, is obsolete and has to be binned and started again. Or if the business has had its fingers in your specification from the get-go and if they have no idea what "signed-off" means you will get only one result; you will never finish and what you do finish will not meet the business need (80% syndrome).

    With all of this in mind we need to concentrate on Software Factories and web services that will allow us to reduce the time to market and increase the happiness of our clients. To do this you need two distinct teams and an interface between them.

    **Why software Factories?**

    Software factories are the answer to the ever increasing need to shorten development lifecycles. You can build and test large blocks of code in preparation to building certain types of applications. If you write effective software factories that you use regularly you will be able to achieve a situation where you are 80% complete even before you start.

    **Why web services?**

    The main reason to use web services is centralized access to data and functionality. If you build your contact management system with web services on the back end you will be able to link any other systems that require all or a part of that data. If you build your address checking system with web services then any time you need and address in any application you will be able to leverage the same tools.

    **Factory Development Team** (the brains)

    The role of the factory team is to produce generic code packages that can be utilized by many applications to make the job of the product team easier and quicker. This can be done at the totally generic level, like the Web Service Software Factory from Microsoft, or at the specific level, for example an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm as a factory. The members of the factory team would spend a lot of their time in research and development of factory solutions and quickly integrate any new technologies into their models. The Factory team must comprise the very best, guru and above, developers to be able to get useful solutions from them and they need to be able to adapt quickly and not be upset if an entire factory has to be dropped, due to the direction the business is taking, and a new one built from scratch. For the factory team testing and stability is paramount so it will take time to get to the right level.

    **Product Development Team** (the brawn)

    The product team concentrates on delivering effective business solutions quickly using the factories provided by the factory team. The developers on this team only need to be of average skill to be able to use the provided  frameworks effectively. The test time for solutions will be a lot quicker as the most complex code parts will have been fully tested by the factory team and it should be like using a boxed product.

    **Developer Evangelist** _(the nerves)_

    The responsibility of the developer evangelist in this instance (although they have other roles) is to help the developers get to grips with the software factories and to take any feedback from the product team back to the to the factory team for them to incorporate into the next version of the factory. In addition to this they should make sure that any developmental production problems are communicated effectively to the factory team. This is probably the most important role, encompassing trainer, developer, diplomat and negotiator into one role for the aim of producing more value to the business, be it internal or external projects. The developer evangelist should be aware of, and be conversant in all of the new technologies to be able to alert the factory team in new factory opportunities and to train the product team in them. They should have good links with the vendor of the products to be able to prepare the entire development and management teams in the advantages that can be gained by the new features.

    With this model your business will be able to effectively deliver solutions that will provide your, or your clients, business with an advantage over the competition. Yes, it takes dedication and perseverance to start this approach as it takes time to build your initial software factories. Obviously if you already have  a development team that is currently producing solutions then it will be all but impossible to change, but if you are starting out and have the freedom to construct a development team from scratch...

    Well, this being my hundredth post I thought I should mention something special... Something that will change my world forever... Something that will keep me up at night...

    My daughter, Evangelina Jade Hinshelwood was born yesterday (24th June 2007) at the Southern General Hospital. Her due date was the 23rd June 2007.

    My wife is someone who does not seam to have contractions until the last minute, so we were happily sitting at home when her waters broke on Saturday (23rd June 2007). We waited, and we waited, but no baby. The midwifes booked us in for my wife to be induced at 8am on Sunday.

    **8:00am**

    Phoned hospital but they said that they were too busy and we will probably get seen the next day. _Ahh well, back to bed..._

    **9:30am**

    Jadie wakes me up with the screams of labor. What do we do, what do we do! I got her into a bath as we both thought we had plenty of time.

    **9:45am**

    Ahhhhhhh...Ahhhhhh... I think that means its hospital time. But getting my wife out of the bath, dressed and into the car, while she was having full on contractions was a trial.

    Every red light was against us, so, when _safe_ to do so ( ;) ) I just ignored them.

    **10:30**

    Got to the hospital and I had to drop Jadie at the front door and park. Just as I was parking another contraction hit and all I could see in my rear view was my wife curled up on all fours in the car park.. Dumped the car. Got out to see that one of the Workmen (the hospital was having some serious renovations) was trying to help my wife up, but she had hold of his arm, and the look of pain on his face was plain to see. The other Workmen had called ahead for help, so I just rubbed my wife's back and tired to get her to breath... (I think we managed to scare the workmen as they all had the look of shock about them.)

    A wheel chair arrived with two midwifes, and then another with another two midwifes (what excellent service).  All the time my wife screaming, "Get me drugs, get me drugs now..."

    We were in a room in about 2 minutes, and between contractions managed to get Jadie onto a bed.

    "ohh", said the Midwife, "I can see the head"....

    _(gory details omitted)_

    **11:14am**

    9 pound baby Evangelina was born! And very proud I was. She was a bit blue and she had a scuffed face from exiting so quickly. The midwife nicknamed her "the missile", but I had my baby girl. My wife managed it without any serious drugs, only Gas & air, so Eva was bright and awake when she came out. She did not even have the usual cone head look due to the speed of her delivery.

    [![](images/t_BABYEVA.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-6423-r_BABYEVA.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    I would just like to thank the Midwifes of the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow for there fantastic efforts and exemplary service dealing with my wife, the workmen for their speedy response, and mostly my wife, for giving me such a gorgeous girl.

    I know that you are not supposed to do it, but I updated my phone to [Windows Mobile 6 Black](http://wmblack.info/), specifically Black 4 (Shadow). This is a fantastic ROM and, if you are not that technical, much better than trying to cook your own! It is described as a Hybrid OEM of [HTC Hermes](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctytn.html) and [Touch](http://www.htctouch.com/) designed specifically for the Hermes. This is good as the current [HTC Touch](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctouch.html) phone does not have 3G or a keyboard, it looks fantastic though. I knew the iPhone would be good for something, pushing HTC to advance the interface!

    I have to say that I enjoy updating my phone. I enjoy cooking my own ROM, I just don't always have the time, so this is a grate option. You still need to know some background to be able to do this, but there is an excellent tutorial from [Mr Vanx](http://www.mrvanx.org) called [Windows Mobile 6 Black Shadow (4.0)](http://www.mrvanx.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=26), which gives you step by step advice on what to do, which as this is only the sixth or seventh update I have done, I still needed to read every line thoroughly.

    I can confirm that this OS update worked perfectly (for me) and I even updated my Radio to the latest version( which if you have a [SPV M3100](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly) from Orange you will know that it needs it). For those that don't know what I am talking about; this is the stage in the update process where you are most likely to "brick" you phone, this is a commonly used team for turning your phone into a paperweight. Which would suck...

    Having performed a successful update I am happy with the result and will probably keep it at least until some other ROM catches my eye!

    **How have your updates gone?**

    This subject goes back over a number of posts:

    - [Setting up TFS to create project portals as child sites of an existing SharePoint 3.0 site (or sub site)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Setting-up-TFS-to-create-project-portals-as-child-sites.aspx)
    - [SharePoint 3.0 TFS Sub-Site creation error.](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/07/SharePoint-3.0-TFS-Sub-Site-creation-error.aspx)

    I will try not to reiterate all that has gone before, but I was trying to get the Project Creation Wizard for Team Foundation server to create project portals as sub sites to an existing Sharepoint 3.0 site, and not as top level sites under a "managed path".

    This has proved a bumpy ride and I would like to share with you my solution. First I would like to air some of my assumptions and results:

    - Can [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") 1.1 support this out of the box? **No!**
    - Will "Orcas" support this out of the box? **No!**
    - If you write a custom Portal creation wizard for TFS will Sharepoint support this? **No!**
    - Will "Rosario" support this out of the box? **Unknown!**

    To support this as an automated process you would need to:

    1. Write a custom web service for Sharepoint 3.0 that uses the API to create the sub site and set it up on Sharepoint 3.0
    2. Write a custom Project Creation Wizard module that uses this web service to create the sub site.
    3. Update the process template that you use to use your module instead of the default one.
    4. Create a site for each of your existing projects and migrate all of the data.
    5. Update the Team Foundation Server application-tier SharePoint Service Registration location entry to point to the new WSS 3.0 location.
    6. Install the WSS3 update to all Team Explorers that are going to create projects.

    \[If I have missed a step, let me know\]

    As a stepping stone to creating this process I have implemented an interim solution:

    1. Update the process template to **remove** all Sharepoint site creation.
    2. Create a site for each of your existing projects and migrate all of the data.
    3. Update the Team Foundation Server application-tier SharePoint Service Registration location entry to point to the new WSS 3.0 location.
    4. After the creation of a new TFS Project, visit the site you want the projects to appear under and manually create a site using the project name in the URL and using the TFS Sharepoint 3.0 Template.

    Although this is a manual step you need to visit the site anyway to add permissions for users. This way, all of the project portals have the same permissions as the parent site.

    This works for us for a number of reasons; firstly only two users have permission to create projects; secondly we have a small total number of projects; thirdly we are not creating projects every day, not even every week. This led us to the opinion that our volume would need a major increase to require spending the time implementing the automated approach.

    Works for us: Would it work for you?

    I had a plan. I wanted to create a way of accessing services in multiple locations from any location. Each location could have one or more services which may be duplications or different. That is a really abstract way of thing about it, but I eventually came up with a solution.

    After using Reflector to view the Team Foundation Server source code, which gave ma many pointers for which I would like to thank the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Team At Microsoft, I came up with the following solution:

    [![image](images/Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_thumb_4-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_5.png)
    { .post-img }

    This allows you to host any number of services, regardless of wither they are remote or local within a "Server" construct and to access that server easily. Remote and local services can exist side by side in the same server, for example you could have an ActiveDirectoryClientService hosted in a ClientServer

    From the server level (IClientServer) you can request a service based on its type or on an interface that it implements. To achieve this the IClientService interface has a property called contracts that loops through all of the interfaces that the client service object implements and pulls out only those interfaces that have the ClientServiceContractAttribute added to them. Thus you need to make sure that all of your interfaces (e.g. ITeamServer) have that attribute regardless of wither it also has a ClientServiceContractAttribute.

    From the factory level you can again request either services by type or by implementation, but this request is cross server. If you have two servers added to the factory and they both implement different contracts, you can pull any one back you like, if both servers have the same implementation you can choose wither you bring back the first or a random implementation. The potential for a load balancing solution is there but not implemented.

    Below is a diagram of my TFSEventHandlerServer that included's both local and remote services. For ease of development and because it is a common thing to do I created the WcfClientServiceBase class that provides a number of features that allow less code to be written in the individual service client classes.

    [![image](images/Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_thumb_5-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    In this example you can call any of the ClientServices with the same code:

    Get the server with a call:

    ```
    Dim Server As Servers.TFSEventHandlerServer
    Server = Servers.ClientServerFactory.GetServer(Of Servers.TFSEventHandlerServer)(New System.Uri(http://server:6873))
    ```

    And get client services with the Subscriptions being a local service and TeamServers is a remote one.

    ```
    Dim Subscriptions As Clients.SubscriptionsService
    Subscriptions = Server.GetService(Of Clients.SubscriptionsService)()
    Dim TeamServers As Clients.TeamServersService
    TeamServers = Server.GetService(Of Clients.TeamServersService)()
    ```

    As I hope you can see this makes it easier to implement many features with an enterprise enviroment. All you have to know is what services are available where. There is also the possibility that a lookup service could be implemented that would allow the Factory to bring you services when you do not even know here they are!

    I hope this helps those trying to find a way to achieve the same goals without being too restrictive. You can download the code from my [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) project.

    As promised I have [released](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057 "TFS Event Handler (Prototype)") the application and code for my prototype [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler). I am currently working on the documentation, but I though I would give the bravest of you advanced notice of the release. You should be able to figure out how to configure it and extend it without much help (who reads documentation anyway), but for those of you who need that extra hand I will hopefully, time permitting, be releasing some sort of rudimentary documentation today!

    There are a number of config options for the [TFS Event Handler Prototype](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057). I will describe all of them in depth here. The first step is to set the [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") service options, which really only requires you to change one value.

    ```
    <system.serviceModel>         <services>             <service name="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.NotificationService">                 <endpoint address="http://[LocalMacheneName]:8677" binding="basicHttpBinding"
                        bindingConfiguration="" contract="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.INotificationService" />             </service>         </services>     </system.serviceModel>
    ```

    The important one is the \[LocalMacheneName\] variable, which should be set to the local machine name, or the domain name that points to your computer if you have a crazy proxy.

    The next step is to set the real options for this software. This starts with the <[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation\> options and requires you to set a number of things.

    ```
    <BaseAddress url="http://[LocalMacheneName]:3624/" />
    ```

    Again you need to set the machine name, but make sure that the port is different.

    ```
    <TeamServers>             <TeamServer name="[TFS Server Name]"
                            url="http://[TFS Server Name]:8080/"
                            subscriber="[Subscriber AD Account]"
                            mailAddressFrom="[From Email Address]"
                            mailFromName="[Form name]"

                            testMode="True"
                            testEmail="[email to send testes to]"

    ```

    In the Team Servers section you need to list all of the team servers that you are going to be handling events for. The system will automatically add the event subscriptions for all team servers added here, but I have only tested with two and I now always run the service on the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server.

    TeamServer Options

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="577"><tbody><tr><td width="138" valign="top"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width="144" valign="top"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width="293" valign="top"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width="141" valign="top">name</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="291" valign="top">This should be a friendly name for the team foundation server</td></tr><tr><td width="142" valign="top">url</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.Uri</td><td width="290" valign="top">The URI for the TFS server you wish to connect to including protocol and port.</td></tr><tr><td width="144" valign="top">mailFromAddress</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="289" valign="top">The address from which you want all emails sent by the system to say that they are sent.</td></tr><tr><td width="145" valign="top">mailFromName</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="288" valign="top">The display name of the from&nbsp;email address</td></tr><tr><td width="146" valign="top">mailServer</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="287" valign="top">The mail server that you have permission for to send emails</td></tr><tr><td width="147" valign="top">logEvents</td><td width="145" valign="top">System.Boolean</td><td width="287" valign="top">A true or false value that enables logging of all events within that system.

    Now you are ready to set the event handlers. These are defined within the "Events" section:

    > <Events\>
    >
    > <!--
    >
    > Use one of the following events:
    >
    > AclChangedEven
    >
    > Branchmovedevent
    >
    > BuildCompletionEvent
    >
    > BuildStatusChangeEvent
    >
    > CommonStructureChangedEvent
    >
    > DataChangedEvent
    >
    > IdentityChangedEvent
    >
    > IdentityCreatedEvent
    >
    > IdentityDeletedEvent
    >
    > MembershipChangedEvent
    >
    > WorkItemChangedEvent)
    >
    > Then you need to add handlers for the events.
    >
    > Example:
    >
    > <Event eventType="WorkItemChangedEvent">
    >
    > <Handlers>
    >
    > <Handler type="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedToHandler"
    >
    > assemblyFileName="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedTo.dll"
    >
    > assemblyFileLocation="~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking">
    >
    > </Handler>
    >
    > </Handlers>
    >
    > </Event>
    >
    > \-->
    >
    > <Event eventType\="WorkItemChangedEvent"\>
    >
    > <Handlers\>
    >
    > <Handler type\="[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedToHandler"
    >
    > assemblyFileName\="[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedTo.dll"
    >
    > assemblyFileLocation\="~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking"\>
    >
    > </Handler\>
    >
    > </Handlers\>
    >
    > </Event\>
    >
    > </Events\>

    As you can see you are theoretically allows to us any events. Please keep in mind that only the WorkItemChangedEvent and the CheckInEvent have been tested. When you add the "Event" tag with the corresponding eventType (which is an enumerator) this tells the system which specific events to subscribe to.

    You can then add handlers to an event. These handlers are fired whenever these events are received.

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="571"><tbody><tr><td width="90" valign="top"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width="277" valign="top"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width="202" valign="top"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width="93" valign="top">eventType</td><td width="279" valign="top"><a title="RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET" href="http://www.rddotnet.com" target="_blank">RDdotNet</a>.TeamFoundation.EventTypes</td><td width="199" valign="top">Enumerator that&nbsp; defines the list of possible events.</td></tr><tr><td width="95" valign="top">type</td><td width="281" valign="top">System.Type</td><td width="197" valign="top">This must be a valid type in the assembly listed in assemblyFileName</td></tr><tr><td width="96" valign="top">assemblyFileName</td><td width="282" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="196" valign="top">This must be a valid assembly found in the assemblyFileLocation</td></tr><tr><td width="96" valign="top">assemblyFileLocation</td><td width="282" valign="top">System.String</td><td width="196" valign="top">A location within the servers file system that holds this assembly. ~ denotes the applications root.</td></tr></tbody></table>

    If you are using friendly server names or TeamPlain the you can change the  TFS server links to be TeamPlain ones using the UrlReplacements config element:

    > ```
    > <UrlReplacements>             <!-- The Url Replaces change the url listed in the event to valid public items             Examples:                 This item changes the TFS url to a TeamPlain v1 url                 <Replace eventType="WorkItemChangedEvent" old=":8080/WorkItemTracking/WorkItem.aspx?artifactMoniker=" new="/workitem.aspx?id=" />                                              These items change the server location to a public host header:                 <Replace eventType="WorkItemChangedEvent" old="[ServerProductionEnviromentName]" new="[PublicProductionEnviromentUri]" />                 <Replace eventType="WorkItemChangedEvent" old="[ServerDevelopmentEnviromentName]" new="[PublicDevelopmentEnviromentUri]" />             -->
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > </UrlReplacements>
    > ```

    This works by replacing values within the URL in the events. You specify the event type, what to look for and what to replace it by. This allows grater control and the integration of TeamPlain into your world. If a task is assigned to someone outside of your departmental sphere who you have given permission to TFS but who know nothing about it, they will still get an email that will link them through to TeamPlain.

    And that is you all set. if you have installed the service and set the account that is used to run the service you should get no errors when starting. No guarantees though :)

    Creating an event handler with the [Team Foundation Server Event Handlers](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/) is very easy. You will need to inherit from the AEventHandler class which is part of [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation.dll located in the install directory (I will make an SDK later).

    [![image](images/CreatingyourownEventHandler_DC01-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingyourownEventHandler_DC01-image.png)
    { .post-img }

    ```
    Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client

    Public MustInherit Class AEventHandler(Of TEvent)

        Public MustOverride Sub Run(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of TEvent), _                                 ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of TEvent))
        Public MustOverride Function IsValid(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of TEvent), _                                         ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                         ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                         ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of TEvent)) As Boolean  End Class
    ```

    Both of the methods that the AEventHandler exposes have the same signature. Hear is what it all means...

    <table width="666" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" unselectable="on"><tbody><tr><td width="139" valign="top"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width="196" valign="top"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width="329" valign="top"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width="139" valign="top">EventHandlerItem</td><td width="193" valign="top">EventHandlerItem(<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Of</span> TEvent)</td><td width="334" valign="top">The event handler item contains information about the handler. This includes an instance of the config data, the handler its self and a status property. The TEvent generic makes sure that everything is strongly types for the event that you are dealing with.</td></tr><tr><td width="139" valign="top">ServiceHost</td><td width="190" valign="top">ServiceHostItem</td><td width="337" valign="top">Base Address of the service, Event Type, Host Config data and a link to the service host object.</td></tr><tr><td width="139" valign="top">TeamServer</td><td width="188" valign="top">TeamServerItem</td><td width="339" valign="top">Config data for the team server as well as an instance of the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.TeamFoundationServer object</td></tr><tr><td width="138" valign="top">e</td><td width="187" valign="top">NotifyEventArgs(<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Of</span> TEvent)</td><td width="342" valign="top">This object allows access to all of the event specific data including the event object, the event type, the <a title="Team Foundation Server" target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx">TFS</a> Identity object and the TFS Subscription object.</td></tr></tbody></table>

    Lets look at the implementation that comes with the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/), the "AssignedToHandler". The IsValid method denotes wither the handler will acrualy run at all:

    ```
        Public Overrides Function IsValid(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of WorkItemChangedEvent), _                                      ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                      ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                      ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of WorkItemChangedEvent)) As Boolean         If e.Event Is Nothing Then             Return False         End If         Dim assignedName As String = WorkItemEventQuerys.GetAssignedToName(e.Event)
            If String.IsNullOrEmpty(assignedName) Then             Return False         Else             Return Not assignedName = WorkItemEventQuerys.GetChangedByName(e.Event)
            End If     End Function
    ```

    This method initially checks to see if the event exists and then queries the assigned name from the event using a work item event query which consists of:

    ```
    Return eventData.CoreFields.StringFields.Find(New Predicate(Of StringField)(AddressOf FindAssignedTo)).NewValue
    ```

    All this does is search the String fields associated with the core work item bits to find the "System.AssignedTo" value. You could so this manually, but I have a number of queries there and you can add any number you wish.

    The logic: If Event exists and assigned name is not empty then check that the assigned name is not the changed name.

    So in English with all of the crap split out: Did the user assign the work item to himself? If not then send them an email!

    The rest, as they say, is just logic. The "Run" method calls the "IsValid" and then sends an email if it is in fact valid, hardly rocket science.

    Hopefully with this knowledge you will be able to make many many event handlers!

    _For the delayed CTP 1 of the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/) I have changed the logic quite a lot but the same IsValid and Run methods exist. The parameters are, however slightly different. I have taken into account security and you will have to make your own connection to the TFS server using your own username and password. I have changed this to protect the security of the application as I want developers to be able to upload event handler assemblies and WF workflow without having to get access to the server. I ahve also changed it so the service that captures the events is not the same one that runs the handlers. This allows me to send the events between these services using MSMQ, thus giving the service some much needed redundancy._

    Due to a number of reasons:

    - My wife is due to give birth this week some time
    - I only have access to [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") at work, and my development time has been cut down.
    - I'm lazy...

    The first CTP of the Team Foundation Server Event Handler has been delayed. I have, however made a number of enhancements of the surrounding framework that will allow the smother function of this and other releases.

    Currently I have completed:

    - [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET") Server Factory - this set of classes and interfaces allows the management, connection and creation of multiple services (both local and remote) even if they are in multiple physical locations.
    - [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET") TFS Event Handler Queuer - this architecture captures all of the events from a particular team server and feeds those events onto a MSMQ [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") service that enables the processing service to be restarted without loosing any events.
    - [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET") TFS Event Manager - this is a tree based structure for managing your servers and uploaded event handlers.
    - [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET") Services Framework - a quick method of creating [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") services that does most of the work for you. This in purely for programmatic implementations as, obviously, the config route is the easiest, but does not fit every bill!

    What I have not yet completed:

    - Getting it all working together :)
    - An effective way of managing the TFS Subscriptions
    - Testing and debugging the whole thing.

    I do have an implementation of the event handler idea that requires hard coded implementation of assemblies. This works, but has no redundancy and is not robust. I have been using it for a couple of months with no problems. I will try to package this up for you guys when I get a moment - unless I have to rush to the hospital, in which case, tough!

    _note:_

    _If I get into work tomorrow I will try my best to upload the installer for the current Alfa version. It is slightly configurable with Event Handlers listed in a config file. Not what I am trying to achieve and you have to restart the service manually when you add a event handler. Oh, and this MUST be installed on the team server and you need to enter a TFS Server Administrator password into the config file. I will call this the "TFS Rubbishy manual Event Handler", and it **will** need some installation instructions..._

    Well my [sub site investigation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/07/SharePoint-3.0-TFS-Sub-Site-creation-error.aspx) did not go too well! After consulting with blogs, forums and Microsoft the end result is that it will not work in an automated way. You can't create a sub site to and existing site with Sharepoint without customizing the Sharepoint site creation process, which I am not going to get into at the moment. Maybe later. The best I can hope for at this time is to disable the creation of the Sharepoint site during the project creation process and to create the site manually after the project has been created. Although this adds a manual step to the process this is not a problem for us as there are only 2 users allowed to create new projects in our environment.

    Extending the project creation wizard may not be that hard! I have only looked at the [examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Extensibility_Guided_Tour/Extending%20Project%20Creation.asp), but it looks doable.  Just don't have the time at the moment as I am trying to concentrate on the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler).

    I will just have to add it to my [Wish list of TFS Tools](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/06/My-Wish-List-of-Team-Foundation-Server-Tools.aspx)...

    My programmer personality type is:  
    **DLTB**

    **You're a Doer.**  
    You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.  
    **You like coding at a Low level.**  
    You're from the old school of programming and believe that you should have an intimate relationship with the computer. You don't mind juggling registers around and spending hours getting a 5% performance increase in an algorithm.  
    **You work best in a Team.**  
    A good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.  
    **You are a liBeral programmer.**  
    Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.

    I have just been made aware of a [new ('ish) service.](http://www.netidme.net/ "netidme") It allows you to verify the identity of those users you interact with online. This is a very usefully service for any online site or community where users are under 18, but is there any value for those of us that are not?

    Would more people interact with me if they could verify my identity? I am not sure.

    The service support a number of interfaces that includes [NetIDme Cardspace](http://netidme-cardspace.com/blog/?p=3 "NetIDme Cardspace") and [NetIDme ChatShield](http://www.netidme.net/chatshield.htm "NetIDme ChatShield") (for MSN Messenger), although they do not say if they support Windows Live Messenger I would assume they do if they are looking ant new technologies like CardSpace.

    In the future could a combination of [CardSpace](http://cardspace.netfx3.com/) and an [Internet identity verification](https://www.netidme.com/netidme.aspx) replace active directory in an ever online world.

    In that envisioned world, all online / hosted services could come together with local services to provide a seamlessly integrated and interactive world where I can log into [SharePoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx), [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx), [Google](http://www.google.co.uk), [Live](http://get.live.com/betas/home), [Exchange Server](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx), [Active Directory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/activedirectory/default.mspx) and windows using a single login with full security and authentication! This sort of service could tie all Single-Sign-On services together with a single **Identity**.

    Hmm, the future is bright...

    You

    If, like me you are a fan of Pocked PC mobile phones you will have something like the [Orange SPV 3100](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly). Like me you will probably not really rate these devices as phones, but it beats carrying multiple technobits in your pocket. You can use it for pictures, email, mp3 (until the [Zune](http://www.zune.net "Zune MP3 player") is released in the UK), reading books (using MS Reader), browsing the web (its not a bad as you would think), and many other things that you require extra software for. What many users of these devices do not know is that Orange does not actually make these phones, it is a company called HTC and they make around 90% of the Smartphones and Pocket PC mobiles. Everyone will have seen the new iPhone that Mac are producing, and although nice to look at, it has a horrendous price tag and you cant get any software for it. Does that remind you of anything, hmmm, any Mac product maybe?

    Well HTC has come up with a first step competitor for the iPhone, and they call it the [HTC Touch](http://www.htctouch.com/ "HTC Touch"). After viewing the promo website I will definitely be looking for that in my next phone.

    My only question is: **When will this be available on orange?**

    I have just looked at the [Surface first look](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/) site and I am truly amazed! I want one, really badly...

    I have been envisioning something like this for years and I am delighted that Microsoft is the one that has brought this vision to reality. If you have ever seen Minority Report you will be drooling over this new technology. If it works as presented this will be the biggest thing in entertainment since, well, the TV...

    I have been working with Team Foundation Server for around a year now and I am still finding features and I am still amazed at the extensibility of the system. The core of this extensibility is the aggressively configurable process templates. You can see a list of [commercial templates](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718801.aspx "Process Templates") on the Microsoft site, not all of them cost money though.

    We have been working on our own process template, but developer are the worst people to design it. For anything more than small, inconsequential configurations you will need some serious effort, especially if you want to configure from scratch, I would not even think of that.

    If you are going to configure process templates for Team Foundation Server you should do it centimeter by centimeter and do not bite off more than you can chew.

    As you will know from my previous [post](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Setting-up-TFS-to-create-project-portals-as-child-sites.aspx "Setting up TFS to create project portals as child sites of an existing SharePoint 3.0 site (or sub site)") I have been trying to get TFS to create sub sites in SharePoint 3.0.

    I now have the hotfix specified by [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2007/04/14/Configuring-Visual-Studio-2005-Team-Foundation-Server-with-Windows-SharePoint-Services-3.0.aspx "Configuring Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0") for my Team Explorer client that allows me to communicate with WSS3.0, but I am still having a problem with my sub site attempts!

    Hey Brian, you said "try it and see", so I did, but it only half works ![](images/regular_smile.gif).
    { .post-img }

    AT the moment I am getting the error:

    > Another site already exists at http://\[server\]:8888. Delete this site before attempting to create a new site with the same URL, choose a new URL, or create a new inclusion at the path you originally specified.

    My registration entries for [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") are:

    > ```
    > <RegistrationEntry>
    >   <Type>Wss</Type>
    >   <ServiceInterfaces>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>BaseServerUrl</Name>
    >       <Url>http://[server]:8888</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>BaseSiteUnc</Name>
    >       <Url>[server]:Projects</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>BaseSiteUrl</Name>
    >       <Url>http://[server]::8888/Projects</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >     <ServiceInterface>
    >       <Name>WssAdminService</Name>
    >       <Url>http://[server]::32831/_vti_adm/admin.asmx</Url>
    >     </ServiceInterface>
    >   </ServiceInterfaces>
    >   <Databases />
    >   <EventTypes />
    >   <ArtifactTypes />
    >   <RegistrationExtendedAttributes />
    >   <ChangeType>NoChange</ChangeType>
    > </RegistrationEntry>
    > ```

    What I am essentially trying to achieve is that all sites are created as sub-sites of the SharePoint 3.0 site http://\[server\]::8888/Projects.

    Now, I am not sure if the problem is the creation of the site, or if it created the site, but can't upload documents. Here is the full Module message:

    > Module: Engine

    I have 3 question that you may be able to help me with:

    - **Has anyone tried to do this?**
    - **And if so, how did you get round this problem?**
    - **Or, even, what is the problem?**

    **TFS Event Handler**

    This tool would run on the TFS server and capture all of the soap events being generated by Team Server. These would then be passed to the Event Handler Manger that would send the event to all of the loaded Handlers. Handlers can be dynamically loaded in to the system by uploading a DLL from a client tool.

    _I am currently working on this: [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventhandler)_

    **TFS Event Handler for Workflow**

    Same as the TFS Event Handler, but passes to any number of WF workflow's.

    _I will probably work on this after the initial TFS Event Handler above..._

    **TFS Submission for Business Users**

    Submission is a simple implementation of the TFS work item creation forms, much simpler than TeamPlain, that allows non-IT people to add work items.

    _I have started proof-of-concept work on this and currently the fields are hard coded. I am trying to interrogate the Team Foundation Server work item store to find all the required fields only and just display those, but I think it will need some sort of configuration utility to specify what fields are available for which projects over and above the default set. [TFS Submission](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSSubmission "Team Foundation Server Submission")_

    **TFS Jira Sync**

    A facility to allow the synchronization of projects with [Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/).

    **TFS Active BPEL Engine Sync**

    A facility to allow the synchronization of projects with [Active BPEL Engine](http://www.activebpel.org).

    **TFS Checkin Notifiers**

    This tool would allow users to request (through VS2005) access to a file checked out to another user, and be notified when the file becomes available.

    I have already [blogged](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/24/TFS-Feature-Wish-Request-Source-Access.aspx "TFS Feature Wish Request Source Access") about this.

    > _Added 16/07/2007_
    >
    > **TFS Sharepoint Sub-Site Creator**
    >
    > This is a customization to the project creation wizard that makes it compatible with sub sites without requiring  a Sharepoint managed path. You can create a site, or sub-site in Sharepoint and get TFS to create its projects as sub sites of that site. This would allow automatic integration with a company intranet implemented in Sharepoint.

    **Does anyone have anything else on your wish lists?**

    I have managed to install SharePoint 3.0 on my dev Team server box in side by side mode by using  [Brian Keller's](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/default.aspx "Brian Keller: Technical Evangelist for Team System") blog on "[Configuring Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2007/04/14/Configuring-Visual-Studio-2005-Team-Foundation-Server-with-Windows-SharePoint-Services-3.0.aspx "Team Foundation Server with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0")".

    I have not yet updated Team Server, but I got as far as having a working version of SharePoint 3.0 running side by side with 2.0. This has worked grate for me as I have had time to evaluate SharePoint as an Intranet for my department. What I would like to achieve is to have and intranet site on http://department.internal.company.com with a sub site called "projects". I would then like Team Server to create all of its sites under this Projects site so as to provide a mini portal for my projects with links to documentation, best practices and tools on the parent http://department.internal.company.com/Projects site along with a reporting services dashboard, with customer reports that cover all of the projects, like RAG reports among other things.

    **Does anyone know if this is achievable?**

    My idea is that in the documentation I replace:

    `<RegistrationEntries>`  
    `<RegistrationEntry>`  
            `<Type>Wss</Type>`

    Well, I spoke to [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/default.aspx "Brian Keller: Technical Evangelist for Team System") about [Connecting TFS to a SharePoint 3.0 sub site](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Team-Foundation-Server-amp-SharePoint-3.0.aspx "Connecting Team Foundation Server to a SharePoint 3.0 sub site")... His answer? _Try it and see._ So I did.

    I updated the dev server with the details I provided in my previous post and Manually created Sites under that http://server:888/Projects site with the same name as the project. I tested this by both clicking "Show Project Portal" and creating a new document library in a project. These two features worked a treat.

    This allows us to seamlessly integrate TFS with our intranet, and have a decent project portal for things like TFS Global reports and links to TeamPlain among other things.

    The real test will come once I get my hands on the Hotfix detailed in KB article #932544 (watch out for the [gotcha](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1658067&SiteID=1 "Configuring TFS with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0")) and I can try creating projects on the new server and in the new location. If this does not work, I will probably have the projects created in WSS 2.0 and manually create projects in WSS 3.0. This will be a minor inconvenience as only two people have permission to create projects.

    Hopefully it will work...

    _Something to check will be the permissions that are setup! I have the parent site setup to inherit from the root, that gives permission to anyone in our company._

    When coding against team foundation server you must be aware that some of the exceptions thrown by [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") are not Serilisable! I think that this was an oversite by Microsoft, but it is there none the less.

    An example of this is; TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException

    If you want to handle this exception accross [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") you will need to create a custom exception of the same name and re-throw this accross your services.

    <DataContract()> \_  
    Public Class TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException

    Public Sub New()  
        ...  
      End Sub

    End Class

    Make sure that you mark it as a data contract and then you can throw it when you encounter the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") exception:

    Try  
      ' [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Connection Code  
    Catch ex As TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException  
      Throw New FaultException(Of FaultContracts.TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException)(New FaultContracts.TeamFoundationServerUnauthorizedException())  
    Catch ex As System.Exception  
      Throw New FaultException(Of System.Exception)(ex, "Failed to do team server thing", New FaultCode("[Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"):EH:S:0001"))  
    End Try

    This will allow you to handle [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") exceptions for your [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") service application on the client.

    If you want to create a [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") Service Host on the fly then you will need to first create a base address. I would recommend using the DNS host entry instead of the My.Computer.Name as I had many problems on the corporate network with \[computername\] not working with our proxy settings.

    ```
    Dim baseAddresses() As Uri = {New Uri(String.Format("http://{0}:{1}/TFSEventHandler/Queuer", System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName).HostName, Port))}
    ```

    Then you need to create the service host itself.

    ```
    Dim sh As New System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost(GetType(Services.QueuerService), baseAddresses)
    ```

    Then set the service meta and debug behaviors so that you can both enable the MEX and remote exception handling.

    ```
    ' Set service meta behavior
    Dim smb As ServiceMetadataBehavior = sh.Description.Behaviors.Find(Of ServiceMetadataBehavior)()
    If smb Is Nothing Then
      smb = New ServiceMetadataBehavior()
      smb.HttpGetEnabled = True
      sh.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb)
    Else
      smb.HttpGetEnabled = True
    End If
    ' Set Service Debug Behavior
    Dim sdb As ServiceDebugBehavior = sh.Description.Behaviors.Find(Of ServiceDebugBehavior)()
    If sdb Is Nothing Then
      sdb = New ServiceDebugBehavior()
      sdb.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults = True
      sh.Description.Behaviors.Add(sdb)
    Else
      sdb.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults = True
    End If
    ```

    Then comes the easy bit, adding the Endpoints. I have chosen to use a Secure wsHttpBinding as I am using Active Directory authentication and I want another level of security. Here I am creating a number of static end points, but also an endpoint for each of the Team Foundation Server SOAP Events, which uses the same code to handle each one, but you can determine the incoming URL for the event type.

    ```
    sh.Description.Endpoints.Clear()
    For Each EventType As Events.EventTypes In [Enum].GetValues(GetType(Events.EventTypes))
        sh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.INotification), GetSecureWSHttpBinding, "Notification/" & EventType.ToString)
    Next
    sh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions), GetSecureWSDualHttpBinding, "Subscriptions")
    sh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.ITeamServers), GetSecureWSDualHttpBinding, "TeamServers")
    sh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Description.IMetadataExchange), GetSecureWSHttpBinding, "mex")
    ```

    You will need to create the binding programmatically as well (see the GetSecureDualWSHttpBinding method referenced above) and you may need to set some specialist options. I needed to increase the size of some of the payloads to implement my service. I have chosen to use the same method to create the service on both the client and the server so I have included the ClientBaseAddress property to get around the problem on Windows of a "http://+:80 error if you have IIS installed.

    ```
    Dim Binding As New WSDualHttpBinding(WSDualHttpSecurityMode.Message)
    Binding.MaxReceivedMessageSize = 655360
    Binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxStringContentLength = 655360
    Binding.ReaderQuotas.MaxArrayLength = 655360
    Binding.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType = MessageCredentialType.Windows
    Binding.Security.Message.NegotiateServiceCredential = True
    Binding.ClientBaseAddress = New System.Uri("http://" & System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName).HostName & ":660")
    Binding.BypassProxyOnLocal = True
    ```

    Using this in conjunction with the custom proxy creation will allow you to build versatile integrated services on the .NET platform.

    The think that always annoys me with web services is that when you connect to it and generate the proxy it always generates proxies for all of the extra classes and interfaces as well, even when you have them available. This means that you always have to write convertors or adapters to convert one object type to another even though they are the same object (only core class and proxy of that class).

    I decided to solve the problem by creating custom proxies for my Windows Communication Foundation services. What you need to do is add a reference to your DataContract and ServceContract assemblies and do the following:

    > Friend Class SubscriptionsClient  
    >       Inherits System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase(Of Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions)  
    >       Implements Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions
    >
    > ...
    >
    > End Class

    This way you have no need of a convertors or adapters between object types. Obviously this only works for .NET to .NET implementations of servers, you Java guys are still on your own, but it a usefully tool to add to your arsenal.

    I am finding a lot of people who are having problems with the speed of Team Foundation Server! I have to say, that I have had none of these problems and I use both a locally hosted team server and [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") hosted projects. I do have some users in the office who have a very slow connection to [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"), but they are on a remote network and use a 2mb link to the main network, so I am not surprised by this.

    If you are having problems with the speed or responsiveness of your team server there are a couple of things you can try!

    Ping: do a "ping -n 20" from the command line to see if there are any problems connecting to your server over a longer time than 4 pings. On a local network you should get an average of 0 to 1 ms ping time with a max of 4-8 ms depending on the size of your network. If you are getting more than this you need to check with your infrastructure team and see if there is something they can do..

    Server Spec: I think that I am spoiled as my server speck is a lot more than the min for [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"). This was not deliberate, but the minimum spec I can get from my company for a dedicated server is dual xeon processors and 8gb of RAM. The RAM is way above spec but this helps when many people hit the team server at the same time, and I have a dual server installation with the same spec on both servers.

    I can only guess what the [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") servers spec's are, but I am sure that they are beefy.

    If you have a slow team server, check the network and then check the performance spec's on your server and see where the bottle neck is...

    **Do you have a slow team server?**

    Well, I have spent the afternoon delving into the features of SharePoint 3.0. As an extensive [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") user I have had a lot of exposure to SharePoint 2.0 and I always found it kinda _crap_...

    I was very surprised to find  that this new version is quite good. I will eventually need a book to get to grips with the more complicated aspects of the system. But I managed to put together an intranet for my department in the same afternoon that I installed and set it up...not bad.

    I will let you know how I get on with the rest of the configuration. I am really looking forward to WF in SharePoint...

    Remote access for Team Server is about disparate teams. This means that you can use those cheep contractors in eastern Europe without needing to give them a small project because of the difficulties in integrating their work.

    Essentially you use SSL with Active Directory to secure the services and sites while giving them controlled access to the system.

    If you use the work items to track all the tasks you will be able to seamlessly and effectively build solutions much to big for your company and extend your reach overseas.

    One of the annoying things about Source-Control is that someone else can have that file you really need checked out! This can be annoying if they are not in the same building or even country.

    What we need is a add-in for Team Explorer where we can right-click on a tree or file that has been checked out by another user and request access.

    This will then notify the user that we want access and prompt them to check-in the file, or notify you that they are still using it.

    Which would then prompt them every 10 minutes to check it in and prompt you to ask if you are still waiting for the file.

    Once he has checked it in, your workspace is automatically updated and you are notified that you can now check out the file!

    Possible [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") project "TFSCheckinNotifier".

    Could be cool, what do you think?

    If you have a small company, say 6 to 30 people, you will look at team server and think, cool...But what does it cost.

    Well, there are a number of costs, some hidden that you will need to pay. The bad news is that the VS2005 Team Editions are expensive, really expensive.

    The good news is that you don't need them. If you have Visual Studio 2005 Standard or Professional you can install Team Explorer and away you go. So, what other costs are there:

    Recipe:

    1 \* Team Foundation server @ £2500

    10 \* CAL (Client Access Licence) @ £300 (which is £3000)

    1 \* Server @ \[whatever you can get away with\] £500 ish.

    All this will bring the price up to around £6000 for 10 users and £12000 for 30.

    What you get:

    - Full bug, issue, risk and task management for your entire business
    - Process management on all these items
    - Document management per project
    - Source Control
    - Reporting on project metrics
    - Integration of all of these things into ONE system that you can cross link.

    Not bad for £6000.

    **Do you think that this is worth it for your company?**

    If you want to go down the full route you will need for for out a further £7500 per developer, architect and tester or £14000 for a user that has more than one of these roles. This changes the project from manageable to silly money and only the big companies will be able to cope with this.

    note: if you only have 5 people that you want to use [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") then you can get the whole lot for the price of an MSDN Universal licence (£2000) or Join the Empower program and get 2 years MSDN universal for £260 per year.

    View Full Question and Answers: [Would anyone be interested in hosted Visual Studio Team System](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/46649-1363184)

    I have been thinking about the potential take-up of a private hosted [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") for small companies! This would be similar to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") but with much more control given to the project owners... i.e. custom Process templates, full work item suite and full customisation capabilities.

    On 5/18/07 10:44 PM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
    I think that we would be talking about a server per customer. This would provide the restriction on visability required by customers.

    The advantage to a hosted service is that you (the customer) do not need any skills inhouse to manage or maintain team server. This will have an apeal to small and medium companies and those that do not have any development resource and wish to use team server to manage non-development projects.

    On 5/20/07 12:27 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
    I will need to look into the idea of Single-Sign-on, but I am dubious about its achievability. I think that the best we can hope for is a web interface that is single sign on but still require additional AD authentication for Source Control. I know that this is not what you want to hear, but [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") requires all users to be in the same domain...  
    And I don't think that you want to expose your domain to a third party company!

    On 5/20/07 12:31 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
    To address latency, I think we would need to use a services like RackSpace, which, although expensive, provides very high connection speeds and low latency. The problem would be the expence!  
    Have you used [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex")? This service is fast, I have been using it at home and work to manage a number of solutions that I work on and I do not find the speed a problem...

    On 5/20/07 12:33 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
    External access on [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") does not require VPN, which would slow it down. It is designed to be made availale over SSL using AD authentication.

    I am thinking of adding WF support to my Team Foundation Server Event Handler, but I am interested in a discussion on the topic of the how's and wherefores. I have seen a lot of people implementing Workflow for Team Server and this would provide them a host system.

    I have started a discussion on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"): [Workflow Implementation](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Thread/Vie...)

    Users could write workflow and host it in the current system, but what I envision would allow users to edit the workflow in a hosted environment and allow them to alter the workflow on the fly!

    Thoughts anyone?

    I am making lots of progress with this project and I have only a couple of work items left for CTP1:

    - 138 [Security issues on uploaded assemblies](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=138)
    - 203 [Error handling on service](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=203)
    - 204 [Create Admin system as Application](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=204)

    Now [204](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=204) is nearly complete, with only testing to go and that is dependant on [203](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=203).

    The error handling is an interesting issue as you really have to hand craft exceptions using the FaultException class otherwise your [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") services will enter the dreaded faulted state.

    I have been reading up on these FaultException thingies, here is the article I have been reading:

    [Willy-Peter Schaub's Cave of Chamomile Simplicity - WCF FaultException … why use it?](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/archive/2006/12/19/WCF-FaultException-_2620_-why-use-it_3F00_.aspx)

    This makes for good reading, and although a little scary on the output side, does highlight the problem and the solution!

    I have decided to go the same root as MS and use the Community Technology Preview (CTP) structure for my releases as there are quite a few people interested in using the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler).

    I am working this week on getting [TFS Event Handler CTP1](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3910) up and running with the full initial functionality. As I am off work this week I should have plenty of time for this, but my wife also want me to paint the house ;), so we will see...

    Here is where I find out that I can't connect to the CodePlex [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Servers!

    After my success with [Beta Exam 71-510: TS: Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server](http://hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/04/25/Beta-Exam-71-510-TS-Visual-Studio-2005-Team-Foundation-Server.aspx) I now find myself thinking that I should get my developer exams sorted. I had never done them before as I would have had to pay for them myself. Which sucks...

    The company I am now working for (the first to have more than 30 employees, and has more than 70,000) has kindly decided that I get a training budget. Now, though the budget is large, it would only cover one and a half of the exam courses per year and I can't be bothered to take 4 years to do it, by which time they will be obsolete anyway, so I have decided to go for the self study approach.

    I am studying for my [Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/) of the [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) flavor. As I have no previous MCP experience I will need to do five exams:

    - [Exam 70–536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation
    - [Exam 70–526](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-526.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Windows-Based Client Development
    - [Exam 70–528](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-528.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Web-Based Client Development
    - [Exam 70–529](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-529.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Distributed Application Development
    - [Exam 70–549](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-549.asp): PRO: Designing and Developing Enterprise Applications by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework

    So I am starting at the bottom and working my way up. First is exam 70-536, the problem is that I have been doing .NET development for 6 years and .NET 2.0 for 2 of those. This means that 80% of things I know already which makes the books rather boring!

    Ah well, back to the book!

    _An excelent resource for 71-510 can be found on the dotnetfun site @ [Prepare for the 70-536 Certification Exam: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation](http://www.dotnetfun.com/articles/certifications/Passing70536Certification.aspx)._

    Developers fall into two categories with regard to building solutions:

    **Envisioners (Research)**

    Envisioners can build complicated code in their head and develop complex proof-of-concept demos. They usually know all about the new technologies and can use them as soon as they are in beta. Envisioners tend to have job titles like "Developer Evangelist", "Technical Evangelist" or "Architect Evangelist". They are not usually good at delivering working solutions, but they can produce things that provisioners think is not possible.

    **Provisioners (Engineers)**

    Provisioners can follow specifications and meet deadlines. They take their time learning new technologies and do not like using anything first. They are usually very good at delivering working solutions, but not necessarily meeting all the requirements, when the requirements don't fit the technology.

    For a project you probably need at least on Envisioner and one to many provisioners, but not an envisioner on their own. This allows your code to be creative and succinct, groundbreaking and working.

    In the realm of the software development industrial revolution, envisioners would build the factories building generic frameworks for many solutions, and provisioners would work on the production line producing usefully solution and providing the business value.

    _What do you think and which are you?_

    I am getting some positive feedback on the project from [Richard Berg](http://blogs.msdn.com/richardb), and he had blogged about it under the title of [New CodePlex project: TFS Event Handler](http://blogs.msdn.com/richardb/archive/2007/05/01/new-codeplex-project-tfs-event-handler.aspx "BUGBUG: poor title"). And [John Lambert](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/showpost.aspx?postid=1542164&siteid=1 "Pass a assembly over a web service!") has commented on some issues that he has envisioned with referenced assemblies and security of allowing people to upload Assemblies.

    I would like to address both of these issues:

    [Security issues on uploaded assemblies](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=138 "WorkItem: Issue: Security issues on uploaded assemblies")

    I do not ever envision that this would be uses when facing the public. It is designed for large internal teams where you want to give them the capability to setup their own Handlers. It may be that all assemblies uploaded must be secured using a key that only I provide to the developers!

    [Referenced assemblies issues](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=139 "WorkItem: Issue: Referenced assemblies issues")

    Although not for this version of the application, I would like to use a zip format file to allow the addition of extra files, like .htm templates for emails, or an additional referenced assemblies.

    I have raised both of these issues on CodePlex and you can vote for them there. If anyone has any other issues that they would like to point out, please don't hesitate to let me know...

    I have now added my [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") EventHandler to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), but don't get too exited as I am currently mid refractor. I am moving to the more reliable Message Queuing for the system, and probably moving it to a Windows Service instead of the current Website. I did actually start with web services but I found it more complicated to setup and create an install.

    You can find the project under [TFSEventHandler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), but I do not have a build for public consumption yet. I have used the [Microsoft Reference License (Ms-RL)](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/referencelicense.mspx) as I may market it, but it will be free for a long time yet.

    With that in mind, I will be doing some level of documentation for the system.

    Fancy joining in then give me a shout over at the [forum](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=9761).

    I am half way through the MSMQ Refactor of my [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) project and thing are starting to come together. I have changed it so that instead of one big solution I will have three smaller ones. This will allow me to cross reference the different services.

    Essentially the Team Server fires events that a service (TFSEventQueuer) captures and adds them, with a little jiggery porkery, to a message queue. The second service (TFSEventHandlers) reads the Queue and executes the appropriate handlers.

    This should be pretty neat once it is complete, and the interface should allow users to easily administer the handlers.

    Still a long way to go... But I hope to have a working version by the end of the week...

    I have found that there is very little content available on the art of selling Team System for developers that want to use it. Developers need to sell it not only to their manager, but to a hole host of people, and it is no small expense to implement it.

    There needs to be some sort of content available to help sell this product, and I mean without trawling through hundreds of MSDN pages, case studies and blogs. Lets face it, if you tell someone a piece of software is good and give them some content, what is the likelihood that they will read it... Zip, that how likely it is.

    The fact is that you not only need to sell this to your management, you need to get every member of the program teams to buy into it as well. This includes Developers, Business Analysts, Project Manager, Testers and Managers, and this is not easy.

    You need an angle for each of these groups and you need to be able talk to each of their needs and concerns. It is a full time job trying to sell Team System to your team. On the upside, if you convince the teams the managers will follow, if only to shut everyone up. I would suggest getting a trial copy of [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") setup under the auspicious title of "Proof-Of-Concept" that will allow you to demo the product. And remember if you go down this root, [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") will be your life: Selling, Deployment, Configuration and Customization... It is never ending.

    My advice is to start small, deploy team server and get it working for you and a few select others. Then get the project managers on board and wow them with reports, even if you have to update [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") yourself and keep it in line with their excel lists of bugs, tasks, risks and issues.

    Forget getting Team Suit or even Team Editions, at £7000 and £2500 respectively these costs are just to prohibitive, you will have enough on your plate getting £2200 per server and £300 per CAL off your budget.

    And Remember: _If you build it, they will come._

    Will, not really...

    I work for a rather large organization and I wanted an easy way for power users of team system to deploy event handlers for the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") events. Essentially they create an assembly with as many EventHandler classes as they like and they can upload their assembly through an administration system, which in turn executes any handlers that exist on the system for any events.

    The Event Handler class format:

    > <EventHandler(EventType:=EventTypes.WorkItemChangedEvent, LogEmail:=[someone@company.com](mailto:someone@company.com))>\_
    >
    > <Logging(Enable:=True, Verbose:=True) \_
    >
    > Public Class MyEventHandler
    >
    > Inherits AEventHandler(of WorkItemChangedEvent)
    >
    > Public Sub Run(TeamServer as TeamFoundation Server, e as EventHandlerArgs(of WorkItemChangedEvent))
    >
    > ' Run any code for the event
    >
    > End Sub
    >
    > Public Sub IsValid(TeamServer as TeamFoundation Server, e as EventHandlerArgs(of WorkItemChangedEvent))
    >
    > ' Check validity of the event
    >
    > End Sub
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > Public Class EventHandlerArgs(Of TEvent as {ATfsEvent})
    >
    > ...
    >
    > ' This is the type of event that is being created as an enumerator
    >
    > Public Readonly Property EventType as EventTypes
    >
    > ...
    >
    > ' This is the actual body of the event as a WorkItemChangedEvent or CheckInEvent etc..
    >
    > Public Readonly Property \[Event\] as TEvent
    >
    > ...
    >
    > ' This holds the URL of the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server that the event originated from
    >
    > Public Readonly Property Identity as TfsIdentity
    >
    > ...
    >
    > ' The subscription info shows information about the subscription options
    >
    > Public Readonly Property SubscriptionInfo as SubscritpionInfo
    >
    > ...
    >
    > Public Sub New(ByVal EventType as EventTypes, ByVal \[Event\] as TEvent, ByVal Identity as TfsIdentity, ByVal SubscriptionInfo as SubscritpionInfo)
    >
    > ...
    >
    > End Class

    There is then a system that handles all of the events and is subscribed through the Bizsubscribe tool, but that allows a user to administer their own EventHandler's through and admin system (Web, Form or XBAP) through a bunch of web services. There is a lot of code, and not enough room to put it up here, I may start a [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") project. I will be adding the admin system for this to our TeamPlain site and I may set it up to deploy as such. I will also require to create a visual studio project template thingy.

    I am afraid I had to code from memory, so any errors or omissions are just my a sign of me getting old, but I hope you get the point and the ease with which you could write and deploy EventHandler's with this.

    As I mentioned in my previous post I am currently building an [EventHandler](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/04/27/Team-Server-Event-Handlers-made-easy.aspx) infrastructure for [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server").

    I am currently toying with the idea of re-engineering to two system services. The first that handles the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") events and puts them onto an event specific message queue and another that handles the reading the messages and action all the event handlers. The reason that I am thinking this way is that when a new EventHandler is added I will need to unload any existing Assemblies and then load them again, and any events that occur during this interval would be lost otherwise.

    This can be easily achievable in .NET 3.0 and will not require much work to implement...

    Just got my exam result for the [exam](http://hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/02/08/Beta_Exam_71_510_TS_Visual_Studio_2005_Team_Foundation_Server.aspx), and I passed! This is a single exam certification so it makes me a MCP as well as and [MCTS: Team Foundation Server](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6176689).

    I want to send a .NET assembly as either an System.Reflection.Assembly or as a string over the wire through a [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") web service. It seems that the class System.Reflection.Assembly can serialize, but is unable to deserialize at the other end. How can this be achieved without sending as a straem of Byte.

    I would prefer:

    <OperationContract(IsOneWay:=True)> \_  
    Sub AddEventHandlerAssembly(ByVal Assembly As System.Reflection.Assembly)

    Or:  
    <OperationContract(IsOneWay:=True)> \_  
    Sub AddEventHandlerAssembly(ByVal Assembly As String)

    But not:

    <OperationContract(IsOneWay:=True)> \_  
    Sub AddEventHandlerAssembly(ByVal Assembly As Byte())

    I have tralled the web for a while now, trying to find a solution. I have even decompiled the Assembly class and the problem is that it implements System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable but does not provide the constructor for the deserialize.

    Does anyone have a solution for this?

    The one thing I do not like about the mobile device center is that it can't sync with the built in windows vista components (Contacts, Calendar and email). This is, I think, a deficiency in the product.

    I would have liked Outlook to also use these components (or to be able to choose to), as it would mean a single storage mechanism for all email clients on Vista.

    From the early propaganda on Vista I had though that this was the point! But it seams that it was one of the things cut to get the thing out the door.

    Hopefully Microsoft will rectify this over time...

    Yesterday I visited the Strathclyde University campus to see a half day session from Microsoft's [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx).

    It was very informative, and although I have been developing in .NET 3.0 for around three months there were some areas that I was sketchy on. Specifically "CardSpace" and its use and benefits. A number of other delegates also had concerns which I also shared. Mike managed to answer them effectively for me, I am not sure about the others, and I can see the use of CardSpace as a single sign on solution that does not require a username or password.

    Mike seams to have a thing for Windows Workflow Foundation as he got carried away with that part of the session and had to skip most of [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation"). I totally agree with him that WF is an excellent piece of work and fills a niche that prior to WF us developers needed to either code ourselves or pay exorbitant costs for a third party product.

    Although I had heard about 60% of the session before, it was well worth while as there were many bits that helped the rest fall into place...

    I was especially interested in a class property manager thingy that is used in workflow. I did not get a chance to enquire of Mike if this can be used by developers independently of WF, but I can see many of the advantages of using it.

    Mike, if you are listening, and can decipher my cryptic description, can you answer this?

    I ran into some problems that I blogged on in my [TeamPlain - Install and initial views](http://team.worldnet-dev.ml.com/workitem.aspx?id=185) post. I have got a work around for the long project name problem, but it only works when you really daft project names like ours:

    "XXEMEA-UK-Area-Dept-BusinessUnit-\[Project Name\]"

    What I have done is rewrite this drop down list after it has been rendered using JavaScript!

    Eww, I hear you say. Well as team server does not support compartmentalization of projects out of the box the long project names must stay.

    Here is the code:

    > <script type="text/JavaScript">
    > 
    > function Remove(ProjectString,ThingToRemove)  
    > {  
    > if (ProjectString.indexOf(ThingToRemove) == 0)  
    > {  
    > ProjectString = ProjectString.replace(ThingToRemove, '');  
    > }  
    > return ProjectString  
    > }
    > 
    > var mylist=document.getElementById("ph1\_cmbProjects");  
    > for (i=0;i<=mylist.length-1;i++)  
    > {  
    > mylist.options\[i\].text = Remove(mylist.options\[i\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-BusinessUnit1-')  
    > mylist.options\[i\].text = Remove(mylist.options\[i\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-BusinessUnit2-')  
    > mylist.options\[i\].text = Remove(mylist.options\[i\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-')  
    > mylist.options\[i\].text = Remove(mylist.options\[i\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area1-PP-')  
    > mylist.options\[i\].text = Remove(mylist.options\[i\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area1-TFS-')  
    > }
    > 
    > </script>

    Put it after the drop down list by the id of "cmbProjects" and change the remove function calls for whatever you need.

    I know it is ugly, but it is the sort of "Tactical" work around that gets the short term problem sorted.

    I permanent solution would be nested projects (Or and Organizational Unit separator for the project name) from Microsoft, but I don't think it is on the cards in the near future!

    I got an interesting question from our SQL Server DBA team in London today. They asked if you can integrate team server with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I had a look at the software and could not see TFS source control in the list, so I did a little google and found:

    [Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server MSSCCI Provider](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=87E1FFBD-A484-4C3A-8776-D560AB1E6198&displaylang=en "MSSCCI Provider")

    Which allows you to connect the following software to team servfer:

    - Visual Studio .NET 2003
    - Visual C++ 6 SP6
    - Visual Visual Basic 6 SP6
    - Visual FoxPro 9 SP1
    - Microsoft Access 2003 SP2
    - **SQL Server Management Studio**
    - Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect 6.1
    - Sybase PowerBuilder 10.5
    - Toad for SQL Server 2.0
      Ahh, they think of everything!

    I ran into a small problem with the tfs admin tool.

    When you add a user to a project as "Contributer" then it adds only "Publisher" to the reporting services permissions.

    ![](images/r_TFSAdminRSPermissionsIssue.JPG)
    { .post-img }

    This is in fact wrong and should also add "Reader" otherwise you get lots of emails from users who can't view the reports!

    This is a minor problem to fix, unless you only notice it after you have created 100 projects... Doh!

    Well, I got TeamPlain installed in about 30 seconds on my dev servers. In fact, it went so well that after about 10 minutes of messing around with it, I installed it in production as well.

    This is a fantastic piece of web work, it has all of the features that you could want from web access. The only problem I have encountered is that My project names are quite long! "XXEMEA-UK-Area-Dept-BusinessUnit-\[Project Name\]" and this does not display in the project drop down list provided, it cuts off around "XXEMEA-UK-Area-Dept-BusinessUn.." so you have to guess on the project it is referring to! I will probably have to rename the projects, no mean feet, to remove at least "XXEMEA-UK-" to make this usable, but at least my users will stop complaining about VS2005.![](images/r_teamddl.JPG)
    { .post-img }

    I am still trying to work out how you control access to projects! Even though users have no permissions for a particular project: I am thinking that removing "Team Foundation Valid Users" from the project will work, I just have not had time to test it...

    > System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: TF14002: The identity NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE is not a member of the Team Foundation Valid Users group.
    >

    Now in the TeamPlain forums a couple of posts defign the problem, but no solution:

    It seams that this is an internitant problem and may be caused by proxy server settings.

    This has only hapened to one of my users sos far and not to me at all.

    We will see...

    Does anyone remember the early video presentations for Vista? Specifically the one about the students collaborating on coursework? The bit I am interested in is the emails with advanced content... Can we do that now?

    The demonstration showed an email being opened and a 3d animated representation of the solar system being displayed with the senders calculations for getting a probe into orbit of one of the planets.

    Now, this looks very much like WPF, and if so then it would be a xaml browser application being hosted in the email. I know that some people will be going "ooh, security nightmare", but surely if it is .NET and running in a sandbox then this would not be a problem.

    I guess my question is:

    Has anyone ever sent an xbap to anyone via email? Not a link, actually running in the email window. And if so, how?

    [RE: What I Hate About XBAPs](http://nerddawg.blogspot.com/2006/11/re-what-i-hat...)

    Ahh, had I only searched the web a little longer...

    I now have a problem! With the inability to send XBAP by email highlited in this blog. Ever since I saw an early MS video presentation on the capabilities of Vista I have longed for this feature. I don't think that this is a "nice-to-have" feature; in fact I think it an integral tool to the WPF arsenal, and Microsoft's integrated computing philosophy.

    Why would you not want to send XBAP's via email:

    - Presentations
    - Forms
    - Demos

    Need I say more...

    I got a call from a friend of mine (Neil Ramsay) who was installing TFS for his company ([http://www.quantad.com](http://www.quantad.com)). Needless to say, he had a few problems, as everyone does when installing TFS. So he gave me a call and I road to the resque.

    The big advantage of installing TFS in a amall comapany, is that you can OWN the entire server. He gave me teh admin password and I had TFS eating out of my hand in about 20 minutes.

    Neil had managed to get TFS working in an imresive mear 2 days, and that is not being sarcastic. It took me 5 days in an enterprise enviroment...

    There were a couple of permission issues, but that got sorted in quick order.

    Neil then broke the bad news to me...One of his developers had moved to Spain and still need access! Sh1t...

    Tune in next week to see how I got on with external SSL!

    If you are installing TFS in a large network that utilises proxy servers, especialy those that strip network credentials for what it thinks are internet sites, then you may run into problems..

    The instalation program always uses the netbios name of you server. But in my enviroment navigating to thsi in a browser produces a DNS error even on the local machiene.

    To solve this problem and actualy get an install, you will need to add:

    > 127.0.0.1       \[servername\]

    To the local hosts file, which you can find at:

    > c:windowssystem32driversetchost

    This will solve the problem on teh local box, but your users will still be unable to access TFS. You require to rename teh server using the instructions: [How to: Rename an Application-Tier Server](<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252469(VS.80).aspx> "Rename an Application-Tier Server") but make sure that you do not actualy rename the physical box.

    You will probably need to rename the server to your fully qualified domain name.

    You will probably need to rename TFS to the fully qualified domain name of your server.

    Have fun...

    I have been very lazy of late with my blogging. But I am now getting a spurt so I thought I should mention that I attended the Roadshow at the Glasgow Science Center.

    I though it would be boring, but apart from one session, it was very good. Two of the speekers realy stood out. The first was [Daniel Moth](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/) who spoke at length about Linq in an enthusiastic mannor. He thinks he talks fast, and alway warns audiences before he starts, but he was just about the right speed for a Glasgow audience (if you have been to Glasgow you will know what I mean). Bit faster next time Daniel, then you will not be pushed for time...

    The other was [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/blog), who is IMO one of the best speekers I have ever heard. He kept me rivited to what for most people is very boring content.

    I knew before it started that these guys were good as I had watched them at the [Vista launch](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/launch2007/dev/review.mspx).

    If you get a chance to get to the roadshow, then do so...

    If you are out there and you have installed SP1 for Team Foundation Server you probably went through as much pain as I did...

    Solution:

    1. Install Data Tier as per documentation.
    2. Install Application Tier as per documentation.
    3. Install SP1 on data Tier.
    4. Repair TFS on data tier
    5. Install SP1 on application tier.
    6. Repair TFS application tier

    If at any point you have a problem. You can always uninstall SP1 from both of the tiers and get the system working again. There are a number of solutions out there, including this one, which can fix the problems you have with TFS SP1... None of them worked for me...

    As most of my friends know a very good friend of mine, Katie McPherson died 4 years ago of DVT. I would like to share a letter I received from her brother, another very good friend of mine, and I would ask you to sign the petition.

    > "As you will be aware in the light of my sisters death some four years ago from a DVT, my family and I have been battling for changes to be made regarding the awareness and treatment of DVT throughout Scotland.
    >
    > Over the past years we have found there is a gene which has been shown to increase susceptibility to DVT. This is called "Factor V Liden". I am one of the lucky people carrying this gene:-).
    >
    > We as a family are pushing for this test to be given to all new born babies as well as young women prior to them being given either the contraceptive pill or HRT. The said medication combined with the Factor V gene unfortunately increases the likelihood of developing a DVT.
    >
    > If an individual is aware of this increased susceptibility they should also be made aware of the symptoms of a DVT and how to combat them.
    >
    > DVT is not uncommon ("more people die from a dvt every year than that of breast cancer, road accidents and MRSA combined") but it can be treatable if caught early enough.
    >
    > As part of our ongoing 'battle' we have raised an epetition for this matter to be raised as a discussion at the Scottish Parliament.
    >
    > I would ask for your support in this matter by following the link below and signing the online petition.

    I hope that many of you will sign this petition...

    I was asked on LinkedIn:

    > "Are you planning to adopt .NET 3.0 in H1 2007?
    >
    > Several clients have asked me if their existing web systems can be upgraded to .NET 3.0. After some investigation, it seems that much of .NET 3.0 is available in other forms. For example, Windows Workflow looks like Biztalk in new clothes while Windows Communication Foundation does not improve on the performance of existing Web Services (though could be useful when setting up new ones). Windows Presentation Foundation/E is still only in CTP form and may require the end user to install a plugin (which removes the main advantage it may have over Flex 2/Flash 9) while I still don't see the USP for Cardspace.  
    > Are your companies using .NET 3.0 purely for new applications?  
    > Is it being used in place of other comparable technologies (e.g. Biztalk)? If so, how does .NET 3.0 compare?  
    > Have you found .NET 3.0's XML-based approach simpler to use?  
    > I am personally waiting for the official .NET 3.0 (Visual Studio "Orcas" + C# 3.0 including LINQ) release later this year before recommending .NET 3.0-based systems."
    >
    > By [Franco Milazzo](http://www.linkedin.com/in/eyetie)

    I answered:

    My company is using .NET 3.0, where appropriate for new applications. We even have Microsoft’s Evangelists doing weekly presentations on WPF, [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation"), and WF to get all of the developers and IT management up to speed.  
    We have around 20,000+ IT staff and need to do this as quickly as possible as we are rolling out Vista and Office 2007 to 75,000 employees this year. As Vista has .NET 3.0 built-in, there is not even a support issue.

    WF is not Biztalk, it will not replace Biztalk, nor will it have comparable features. However the next version of Biztalk will use WF as its internal orchestration engine as will many of Microsoft’s future products.  
    WF requires coding and integration work while Biztalk provides a much larger package that has masses of automation that is not provided in WF.

    WPF/e is essentially Microsoft’s replacement for Flash. WPF/e has a number of advantages over Flash the main one being integration; Flash sucks at communicating with other platforms, such as .NET or Java, while WPF/e uses native .NET thus providing the functionality of this platform in the animation environment; no more (non) action script.

    CardSpace provides something that has never been available for all internet sites before. Single sign on! Yes, it has been available in various proprietary and expensive forms before. CardSpace allows the users to manage their identify themselves and to control what information is used by sites. It use open source xml to be platform independent and I believe there is already a Linux version along with Firefox support. Its mainstream use will be dependant on developer uptake and not users, so it will probably have a slow market penetration.

    There is no reason why you should not use .NET 3.0 on new projects. The only reason to upgrade .NET 2.0 projects would be to simplify support and increase flexibility if you are using web services, remoting, message queuing, workflow or single-sign-on. Upgrading to .NET 3.0 is not really the way to think about it as you are still using the .NET 2.0 runtime. When ‘Orcas’ is released so will .NET 3.5 which will bring a new version of the CLR as well. This will not be the same product and even Vista will need updating to support it!

    Go with .NET 3.0!

    I also sugested an expert:

    Well, its about time: The WMDC is out of beta and is available to [download](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devicecenter.mspx "Windows Mobile Device Center Download"). WMDC is the replacement for ActiveSync on Vista and I would have expected it to be available for the business release of Vista. Up until now users have had to make do with the beta version that was originally released for Vista RC1, and I can tell you it was a little flaky in places. Not anything really problematic, just the usual beta unfinishedness, though it was usable.

    I was very happy to get my Windows Alert this morning from [Daniel Moth's](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/02/wmdc-rtm.html "Windows Mobile Device Center") blog to say that it was released and it was a painless procedure to get rid of the beta and install the RTM.

    Have fun... Unless you have Windows Mobile 2002 or below which is not supported...

    That's was you get for having a 4+ year old Pocket PC.

    I found out the other day that there is another implementation of TFS in the company. Not even the principal UK Architect, who recently visited the US knew of this. I do not think that it has been communicated outside of the department. That is an inevitable aspect of such a large company. The only way to get things working is to keep your head down until you have a viable solution, otherwise you get blown out of the water as soon as department z resizes that you product my do away with their solution for one part of of a larger system. Sillyness...

    The only way to get ahead in this industry is to get the software out of the door more quickly than the competition. Last year, our company made billions because they worked out a way to get the data to the traders 600 milliseconds faster than the competition! Now, this is an extreme example, but it highlights the speed of the industry.

    In the sector that I work in, mortgages, the winner is the one who can sell the most mortgages and securitize more often. That means that the information available to the management the collection of the original data, needs to be up-to-date, correct and comprehensive.

    To do this we need to industrialize our activities. This means that we need solid reuse of components that have already been tested and stabilized. We need those components to be able to be used on "the factory floor" to produce highly scalable application quickly.

    Team Foundation Server can provide this. I am not saying that it will provide this to everyone, just as a production line does not make every factory successful. But the facility is now there to provide an infrastructure to working collaboratively on IT projects that Outlook just does not mat

    Just as there was an industrial revolution over the steam engine in the early 19th centaury and one in the 1920's witchery Fords production line, Team Foundation Server will push IT into a revolution of its own...

    There are a number of challenges to overcome when developing a new business. One of the hardest to get right is your web presence. I have been involved with [Scottish Enterprise](http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/) before and recently got a question from my sister-in-law who has a new job over at [Islington Enterprise](http://www.islingtonenterprise.co.uk/), and questions are always asked about Websites, SEO, DNS, Blogs, Accessibility and other things that most Internet users just do not understand. The may appreciate the results, but they do not understand the complexities of producing it. I will answer a few questions here for all to see...

    # What is SEO?

    Well [Search Engine Optimisation](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) ([SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)) is the black art of improving your ranking on search engines. It is well known that users of search engines very rarely get passed the first 10 results (first page) if a search, at most they will look at the first 20 results.

    SEO uses key-words and descriptions in [meta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_tags "Meta element") tags as well as key word density in the copy. The copy will need tweaked on a decreasingly regular basis as the desired results are achieved. I good SEO specialist may also be conversant in [NLP](https://inlpcenter.org/what-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp/ "Neuro-linguistic programming") ([Neuro-linguistic programming](https://inlpcenter.org/what-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp/)) giving your site an edge once users actually get to read the copy.

    SEO is highly complex, and requires many experts. There are a good number of company's out there that can provide decent SEO services, but few who are true experts as it is more of a art than a science.

    Contact: [Iain Frame](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/ "Iain Frame") @ [If Only Design](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/) | [Greg Fyans](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ "Greg Fyans") @ [Black Red](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ "Web Developer")

    # What is DNS?

    [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system "Domain name system") ([Domain name system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system)) is quite complicated in detail, but simple in concept. Essentially all computers, websites and devices on the Internet are referenced by [IP addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) (e.g. 192.168.0.1), but these IP addresses are not user friendly. Imagine having to type in 64.233.183.99 every time you wanted to go to Google. Thus DNS was born. When you type [www.google.co.uk](http://www.google.co.uk) your computer looks up the address on a DNS server and translates it into the IP address. Simple...

    Recommendation: [DynDNS](http://www.dyndns.com/)

    # Why would I want a blog?

    Blogs drive traffic plane and simple. Even if it is a developer working for you that blogs, it gets additional visibility to your site and reassures customers and partner that you are reputable and capable. But be warned, savvy blog readers can spot a fake 50 pixels away...

    # Who do I need to build my site?

    You need a number of people. I will give some examples and contact suggestions for those that are looking for a website for their business or intending to improve their existing website for the benefit of their bottom line. The suggestions I make may not be the cheapest, but they will be the best to my knowledge..

    ## Designer

    You will need a professionally designed site. It is no longer good enough to do one yourself or to skimp on the design. If you do so you will loose credibility with a majority of your customers and be dismissed immediately by many more.

    Contact: [Iain Frame](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/ "Iain Frame") @ [If Only Design](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/)

    ## Web Developer

    A professionally developed site will contain many things that are not apparent to the user. Accessibility: This is one of the most important part of your site. It ranges from a blind person using a "reader" to someone with [myopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia) or [glaucoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma) visiting your site. Do you really want to reject their custom just because they have poor eye site. A good web developer can provide you anything from plane [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to dynamic content to full [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Content management system") ([Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)).

    Contact: [Greg Fyans](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ "Greg Fyans") @ [Black Red](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ "Web Developer")

    Recommendations: [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") - Due to its quick time to market and the abundance of help available.

    ## Copywriter SEO Specialist

    See SEO above!

    ## Hosting Company

    Hosting companies are hard. They all end up being rubbish in the end: IMO. Only a few stand out, Rackspace, Serverbeach and a few others, but they are expensive! Your best bet is to shop around and find the cheapest and the most expensive and take and average. Somewhere around £40-£50 per month should suffice for the start. Expect to pay £200-£400 per month for dedicated hosting once you get a lot of hits.

    Recommended: None | take the advice of your designer or developer.

    # Costs

    Expect to pay a LOT for a good web solution. Remember this will become one of your major revenue streams. The company I work for takes around £3 billion a year, 70% of which is through their website. Good SEO can increase these percentages.

    You can look up any of the bits on wikipedia.org to find out more details, linked above. The cost of building a website is tiny compared to the revenues generated as a consequence of having one, but without any details about the target business I can’t say what it will cost. I can estimate though:

    - Basic website (design & html only) - £5,000 one off with £40 per month
    - Dynamic website with contact forms / news / blogs (£10,000+ one off with £40 per month)
    - Content managed website with all the trimmings (£50,000+ one off and £400 per month)

    # Troubleshoot InfoBites

    - Get a professionally made site.
    - If you are getting a website for under £1,000 it will be rubbish, that will not even cover the design!
    - If you are getting a website for under £5,000 it will be mediocre.
    - If you are planning to run your business through your website then budget for £20,000 to £100,000 for your initial outlay depending on your scale.
    - Update your site often.
    - Use blogs on your site, it will drive traffic.

    Ever since PayPal burst on to the scene, the Nostradamus types have been predicting one PayPal killer after another. First it was "e-gold," then Western Union, then C2IT (by Citibank), then Google.

    Sorry that I have not posted on this subject in a while, but I am lazy. After that last elongated post I am in the mood to write again...

    Our TFS implementation is moving forward. I did a presentation on Friday to my peers and  bosses on the need for TFS and the appropriate uses of it. This has all come about as the scope of the project I have been asked to undertake has increased. Instead of 6 developers an 4 project managers, I have been asked to spec for 10 developers and 20 other users. This requires the sourcing of desktops for all as not only do the current computers not have corporate builds (my company buys the windows source and does strange things with it) but the 20 users have thin clients, which will not support Office 2003 (physically yes, but our infrastructure requires Office 2000). More cost..

    I will also have to put in a dev environment and a disaster recovery environment, more cost, and get servers hosted in our datacenters. All in, not including the desktops (which we need anyway to comply with corporate policy) the current implementation of TFS will cost around £100,000 ($200,000). Thus, rightly so, I have higher-uppers questioning the cost and need for the system.

    The result is that for a company of our size, 75,000 est., with over 5,000 developers alone, I do not think that we can operate effectively in the cut throat world of investment banking without the advantages that TFS will provide.

    Sure, we can calculate the metrics yourself, but we will miss things.

    Sure, we can have each team build website   wiki's to manage their content so other developers can see what is going on, but with that many developers how will we keep track.

    Sure, we can implement some sort of open source source control system (Subversion or ClearCase), but will we really be able to see all the code, or incorporate local and global changes?

    I think not.

    It would be far better to have a complete solution that covers all aspects of the development life cycle, instead of having piecemeal system knitted together by a variety of technologies.

    I am a little confused by all the hullabaloo over the Outlook email changes [Mary Jo Foley](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/ "Mary Jo Foley") recently blogged in her article [Outlook 2007 users angry over Office 2007 HTML-e-mail changes](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/wp-trackback.php?p=200 "Permalink") about some of the changes. I think that this change is a good thing. It moves away from emails being HTML and more towards them as documents. This is the way that most users use email, as documents and it would be much better to have email files as Open XML, there by allowing searching and indexing of the emails in a much easier way.

    This is a move forward in email, not backward. It may be a move backward for the design of marketing emails, but who cares, not the users. IT is an ever changing field, if you can't embrace that then you really should not be in IT.

    It is not the users that are angry. Why would they be, this does not significantly affect them. It is the developers and designers that are angry, get with the program...

    Are there any USERS out there that are angry? I think not...

    I have found a site with a list of many of the [applications](http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx "Team System Widgets") available for Team System. It seams to be updated regularly and should help with some of the v1 shortcomings of team Foundation Server.

    [http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx](http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx "Team System Widgets")

    I am particularly interested in the [TeamPlain](http://www.devbiz.com/teamplain/webaccess/ "TeamPlain") web products from [DevBiz](http://www.devbiz.com "TeamPlain"). The web interface is sorely lacking in TFS, but at least one can develop against the platform extremely easily.

    Has anyone used TeamPain?

    The TFS guys have just updated the [Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Installation Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=E54BF6FF-026B-43A4-ADE4-A690388F310E&displaylang=en "Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Installation Guide") to a new version released on 4/1/2007 and it incorporates all of the SP1 updates.

    I have been browsing the documentation for a while now and the main differences are that the guide now includes SP1 in the install procedures. Another change is that it also includes instructions on installing Reporting Services and Analytical Services on a separate server.

    I think that I will be using much of this content for my documentation for our Infrastructure department.

    I am looking forward to the Admin Guide being updated as well!

    How has everyone got on with their TFS implementations?

    Now, I have, up until now, not had any experience with proxy servers. Well, to be honest, I still don't... But I do have some experience with IIS as I have been using it since the sad old days of NT4. Yes that's right, before Active Directory, The bad old days when domains were the work of a craftsman.

    Anyhoo, my brother [David](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b "David Hinshelwood's Profile") called with a little problem with .pac files for a proxy server. My first though was that I did not know a dam thing about proxy servers, except that annoying "Access Denied" message you get when you try to go to the one URL that has the exact answer to the problem you have been trying to solve for hours... Well that's not exactly true, I know what a a proxy server does in theory and what a .pac file does, I have just never used one..

    [David](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b "David Hinshelwood's Profile") had two problems, well three if you count the network security guru bit.

    The first reared its ugly head when he tried to access a .pac file from IIS. 404! WTF! He could see the file, but no download. Change it to a .txt and there it is. It seams that [IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3bEN-US%3bq258141 "IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types"), unlike previous versions. Adding the MIME type solved the problem: David did actually get this far, he just entered an incorrect MIME Type that he found on the web.

    Inaccurate information on the web! Never... ;)

    The second problem was that he was using a proxy server that was an appliance (i.e. a hardware box that probably said something like "Cisco proxy magic" on it) and it did not support host files. He needed a domain to resolve to something other than the IP stated on the web. As I have had some ups and downs with  Active Directory I had had this problem, among others, before. What he needs to do is add the domain he wants to repoint (say google.co.uk) to the DNS server and enter the IP address that he wants it to resolve to. Now when an internal request for that domain reaches the DNS server it is handled internally instead of being forwarded to the big cloud.

    So all problems solved, well theoretically... David still need to try them out side of my little home lab.
