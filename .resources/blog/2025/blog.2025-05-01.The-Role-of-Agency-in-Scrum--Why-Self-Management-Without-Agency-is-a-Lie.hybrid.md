[Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) is often misunderstood as a set of ceremonies or a lightweight [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}) method. It is neither. Scrum is a social technology built around the ethos of Agile, enabling teams to deliver adaptive solutions in complex environments. At its core lies a fundamental, non-negotiable requirement: self-management.

But self-management is not simply a label you apply to teams. It demands something deeper and harder: real agency.

Without agency, Scrum collapses into shallow ritual. Without agency, accountability is performative, not real.  
Without agency, you are not doing Scrum. You are enacting a fragile imitation of agility.

## Scrum _Is_ Agile — and Agile Demands Self-Management

Agile and Scrum are often conflated or treated as separate. Let us be clear: True Scrum is Agile. Scrum operationalises Agile principles with discipline, [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}), and empiricism. It creates a bounded environment where teams can thrive.

The Agile Manifesto (2001) made it clear:

> _The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams._

Self-organisation was never about anarchy. It was about **teams owning how they deliver value**. Agile assumes teams will figure out the best way to achieve goals — not be told exactly what to do.

Scrum sharpened this requirement in the 2020 Scrum Guide:

> _Scrum Teams are cross-functional and self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how._

Self-management is not a bonus feature. It is the foundation. Without it, Scrum is impossible.

## Agency: The Prerequisite for Accountability

Agency is the power to make decisions and act toward outcomes you are accountable for. It is inseparable from accountability itself. Without agency, accountability is a façade — a mechanism for assigning blame rather than empowering success.

Scrum defines clear accountabilities:

- **[Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}})**: Maximising value.
- **Developers**: Delivering a usable [Increment]({{< ref "/tags/increment" >}}) every Sprint.
- **[Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}})**: Enabling the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})’s effectiveness.

These accountabilities **assume** that those who hold them [have real authority to act]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2025/2025-03-12-balance-of-leadership-and-control-in-scrum" >}}).

When organisations strip away decision-making power but leave accountability in place, they are not enabling agility. They are constructing a system of learned helplessness.

## The Myth of "Self-Managing" Teams

Many organisations today claim to embrace "self-managing teams" but operate in ways that directly undermine them:

- Sprint Goals are dictated, not created.
- Work is assigned to individuals by managers.
- Technical decisions are second-guessed by external authorities.

This is not self-management. This is hierarchical command-and-control wrapped in daily standups and sticky notes.

If your team cannot decide _how_ to achieve the Sprint Goal, they are not self-managing. They are being managed under a different name.

## Weak Scrum Masters Enable Weak Scrum

Scrum Masters are **accountable for the effectiveness of the Scrum Team**. Yet in practice, [many are limited to scheduling events and taking notes]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2024/2024-09-05-the-incompetent-scrum-master-why-most-are-failing-and-what-they-should-know" >}}), with no real authority to challenge systemic dysfunction.

A Scrum Master without agency is not fulfilling their accountability. They are facilitating ceremony without enabling change.

Scrum Masters must:

- **Teach** [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) and teams what true self-management entails.
- **Coach** teams to take ownership of their processes and outcomes.
- **Mentor** individuals to step into accountability with courage.
- **Facilitate** organisational evolution, not just event logistics.

If you are a Scrum Master and [you cannot do these things because of organisational resistance]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2025/2025-03-12-great-scrum-masters-need-technical-business-and-organisational-mastery" >}}), you must raise it visibly. Otherwise, you are complicit in the degradation of Scrum.

## Why Weak Implementations Collapse

When organisations adopt the **appearance** of Scrum without enabling the **conditions** for Scrum, dysfunction inevitably follows:

- Daily Scrums become status reporting.
- Sprint Reviews become formalities with no real inspection.
- Retrospectives become meaningless because the team lacks the power to change anything.

Scrum without agency becomes a theatre production. A ritualistic reenactment of agility, without any of the outcomes.

When organisations complain that "[Scrum doesn’t work]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2021/2021-04-19-stop-normalizing-unprofessional-behaviour-in-the-name-of-agility" >}})," the reality is usually simpler: **they refused to enable it to work**, and they [ignore the evidence of their own dysfunction]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2024/2024-04-17-you-cant-stop-the-signal-but-you-can-ignore-it" >}}).

## The Path Forward: Fight for Agency

If you are serious about creating real, resilient agility:

- **Scrum Masters** must coach, teach, mentor, and cause real change — not just facilitate ceremonies.
- **Product Owners** must demand the authority to own the backlog and drive [product strategy]({{< ref "/tags/product-strategy" >}}).
- **Developers** must guard their right to decide how to build and deliver working product Increments.

And leadership must understand: if you want the results Scrum promises, you must create the environment Scrum requires.

Self-management is not optional. Agency is not optional. Without them, you have nothing.

## Conclusion

Scrum depends on self-management, and self-management depends on agency. Remove agency, and you remove the heart of Scrum. All that remains is empty ceremony, a hollow simulation of Agile values.

If you truly want the benefits of Scrum — adaptability, resilience, continuous [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}) — you must be willing to do the hard work of granting real agency to those accountable for outcomes.

**Scrum without agency is not Scrum. It is theatre.**

Choose what you want to build.
