Well I finally got of by behind and set up a site for [RDdotNET](http://rddotnet.com), its not special or clever, but it does let me host ClickOnce Applications like the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://rddotnet.com/tfsstickybuddy) and give a single portal to my other tools. I only have [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Sticky Buddy and [TFS Event Handler](http://rddotnet.com/TFSEventHandler.aspx) up at the moment, but I will expand on that.

Eventually all my bits and bobs will be up [there](http://rddotnet.com) with my blog over [here](http://hinshelwood.com).

Hopefully you will find the ClickOnce hosting useful, if not the site content…
