With the new Windows Live Wave 3 betas now available I am looking forward to many of the features I have already previewed in the beta of Windows Live Messenger 9.

These are the English installs, but [other languages are available](http://www.liveside.net/main/archive/2008/09/16/windows-live-wave-3-betas-download-now.aspx).

Web or partial install:

[http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-web.exe](http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-web.exe)

Full local install(recommended if you are behind a firewall):  
[http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-all.exe](http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-all.exe)

I am only really interested in Messenger and Writer, but all the

application are there.
