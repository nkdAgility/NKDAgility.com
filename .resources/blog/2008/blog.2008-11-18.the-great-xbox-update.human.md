I hope everyone is looking forward to the [new Xbox live experience](http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/live/NXE/) that will be going Live tomorrow! Hopefully we are passed the days of the ring of death from the update, unless you have a hacked box :)

Although I am not really interested in the Avatar piece, I think it will be well worth it. The update process is a little different this time, so you are not surprised there is a video detailing the process.

I never made it into the [Preview](http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/10/24/the-new-xbox-experience-preview-program.aspx) program this time around, but watch this space for my Avatar tomorrow :)
