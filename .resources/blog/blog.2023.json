    "BodyContent": "This week, I participated in a [Scrum.org](http://scrum.org/) Webinar hosted by Sabrina Love ([Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}).org [Product Owner]({{< ref \"/tags/product-owner\" >}})) as well as my colleagues, [Joanna Płaskonka, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7140678898370928640/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAUzPABQyVbo7yoAY7fK8HpaEwXfTa5iCY#) and [Alex Ballarin](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7140678898370928640/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAUzPABQyVbo7yoAY7fK8HpaEwXfTa5iCY#) to discuss the state of learning and how immersive learning is the future of training.\n\nYou can watch the video below to hear what we say, but it's also worth framing the problem and the need for change here. I welcome all feedback!\n\n### What is Traditional Training?\n\nTraditional learning is typically delivered over a short period of time, mostly with consecutive sessions, sometimes with a little more space. The idea in the traditional format is to get the participants to a level of understanding/knowledge as quickly as possible.\n\nThis typically takes the form of 2 full days of training for your PSM/CSM or other agile class.\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQG1-TOAWFaNBg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1702471584021?e=1707955200&v=beta&t=vXvE0YNiUTkb_8FAl26rQF4vAdO2yFq5XepdVIBXAek)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWe have \"Learn a new Concept\" that enables participants to remember the content and then follow that up with \"Practice with Examples\" to enable understanding.\n\n![](images/image-8-1280x585-11-13.png)\n{ .post-img}\n\nThis would fulfil the first two stages of Bloom's Taxonomy for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment. For some participants, this is enough for them to infer greater learnings, but for most, it is not.\n\nWithout a substantive change to the participant's mental models, it is unlikely that the ideas will stick or the seeds germinate into real change.\n\n### What is Immersive Learning?\n\nImmersive learning is typically delivered over a much longer period and may look like a combination of consulting, [coaching]({{< ref \"/tags/coaching\" >}}), and teaching. For example, our immersive programs are delivered one half-day weekly for 8-12 weeks.\n\nLike traditional training, we have \"Learn a new Concept\" that enables participants to remember the content and then follow that up with \"Practice with Examples\" to enable understanding. However, we follow up with an \"Outcome-based Assignement\" that enables the application of things we have taught to their real world of work and a \"Facilitated Reflection\" where they can Analyse the outcome.\n\n![](images/image-7-720x720-9-11.png)\n{ .post-img}\n\nIn effect, we close the learning loop with empiricism. A feedback loop is created.\n\n![](images/image-9-1280x585-13-14.png)\n{ .post-img}\n\nThis would then fulfil an additional two stages of Bloom's Taxonomy and enable, over time, the last two.\n\n### Why is traditional not working?\n\nWhile traditional learning has been used for many years in many industries, it has a significant and known downside. Most folks only remember a fraction of the content presented to them.\n\nThis can be augmented with additional homework to enable more connections with the content but it has little to no additional value and can at times have a negative impact. Every participant is different, and we have experimented with providing watching, reading, and writing content... but there is little apatite for it with participants and very few partake.\n\nUltimately very little is remembered in the weeks and months that follow a traditional classroom session.\n\nI've been delivering traditional training for over ~13 years, and even with augmentations to the format, I've seen limited value for companies. There needs to be more than training to enable organisations to get the perceived value for most people. This results in an expectations gap where they have trained hundreds of people and have not seen things improve or change.\n\nIn the 13 years of traditional training, where I would travel onsite, I have seen it have a palpable impact only twice... both times, it was combined with consulting, coaching... and a little ass-kicking to get things moving.\n\nHowever, it's only sometimes possible for most trainers to follow up to the depth the customer needs. Perhaps you have another training in another country next week... but this customer needs more help... (pre-pandemic I was travelling 300 days a year with customers. This took little time to follow up).\n\nAs we all moved into the pandemic and things moved online, I got breathing space between engagements where I was not in an airport. I was able and willing to engage, collaborate, and coach at my desk. But folks needed more time. The had their day job, their issues, and the mandatory training course from last week or last month needed to be more interesting.\n\nI even offered additional consulting for every student, cumulative for companies with private classes, and still, I am still waiting for something to happen. Less than 5% used it, and I could not get above 6% even with follow-up.\n\n**Queue immersive formats.**\n\n### Why is Immersive Always a Better option?\n\nBy bringing the classroom content into the workplace and having participants try or do things from the learning in that environment we have a chance to close the feedback loop and have participants not just gain knowledge and understanding, but also be able to apply, and analyse the outcomes.\n\n![](images/image-6-720x720-7-8.png)\n{ .post-img}\n\nThis would enable double-loop learning, where participants can apply the ideas learned in their own environment and then come back around and make real, lasting changes to their mental model and the mental model of those around them in their environment.\n\nEven this is a rather simplistic linear view, and you could imagine multiple instances of the image above stacked on top of each other and the feedback from the \"Outcome -based assignment\" that is applied in the workplace not only goes from the previous session to the next, but also to traverse the instances of the sessions to reinforce and continuously update the learning loops.\n\nFor example, a participant may try something after session one and then ask to participate in exploratory learning of the outcomes, as they continuously happen in sessions 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\n> My attraction to immersive classes stems from contrasting experiences: the lasting impact of a detailed MongoDB course, complete with weekly homework and a final exam, versus the fleeting memory of a two-day crash course in team management, which left me overwhelmed and fatigued. These experiences have shaped my preference for immersive learning.\n\nThis continuous reinforcement and engagement, both from the qualified expert instructor and the other participant peers engaged in similar outcomes, multiplies the effect of the training and embeds new mental models in all of the participants.\n\n![](images/image-5-912x720-5-7.png)\n{ .post-img}\n\nFor double-loop learning to be effective, participants need to be able to make a substantive change to their mental models as they progress through the content. This deeper change and learning is enabled by the application in the workplace and the analysis of what happened and why that comes from the \"facilitated reflection\".\n\nDouble-loop learning is not guaranteed by participating in immersive learning, but it does enable it.\n\n### So, is traditional learning dead?\n\nTraditional two-day classes are of the past, and immersive multi-week classes are of the future. That is not to say that tradition is dead; it will be around for a long time as we transition, but we must transition.\n\nImmersive takes what we learned teaching traditional classes, in Scrumorg's case, for 13 years, and adds more value, learning, and opportunities for change.\n\n**_Immersive learning is the future of Agile and Scrum training, hopefully, all learning._**\n\n### Webinar: Exploring the Different Ways People Learn: A Discussion about Immersive Learning Formats\n\nIn this video, [Scrum.org](http://scrum.org/)’s Product Owner Sabrina Love and [Professional Scrum]({{< ref \"/tags/professional-scrum\" >}}) trainers [Alex Ballarin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexballarin/), [Joanna Płaskonka](https://nkdagility.com/company/people/joanna-plaskonka-phd/), and myself ([Martin Hinshelwood](https://nkdagility.com/company/people/martin-hinshelwood/)) discuss the evolution and effectiveness of immersive learning in Agile environments.

    "BodyContent": "In the rich tapestry of ancient Greek philosophy, the concept of the seven deadly sins stands out as a profound exploration of human nature and morality. Deeply rooted in Greek thought, these sins were not seen as fleeting transgressions. Instead, they were formidable obstacles, barriers between individuals and a virtuous, fulfilling life.\n\n![](images/NKDAgility-technically-7DeadlySins-jpg-15-16.webp)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThese sins promised personal suffering, societal decay, and eventual destruction if left unchecked. Fast forward to our modern era, as we traverse the intricate landscape of [software development]({{< ref \"/tags/software-development\" >}}), particularly through the lens of the agile approach, we find these age-old Greek sins echoing in the challenges and pitfalls agile teams often encounter. The striking parallels remind us that while times have changed, the essence of human challenges remains consistent. This journey involves identifying these pitfalls in the agile world and drawing wisdom from ancient Greek insights to navigate and overcome them.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Pride (Hubris)\n\n{{< youtube BDFrmCV_c68 >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/BDFrmCV_c68\" >}})\n\nIn ancient Greece, Hubris was considered an excessive self-confidence, often the root of all sins. It warned against overestimating one's abilities to the point of challenging the gods themselves. In the agile context, Martin discusses how this excessive pride can lead teams to believe they're infallible, often overlooking critical feedback and insights. Such teams might think their approach is beyond reproach, leading them to dismiss valuable external perspectives. This can result in resistance to change, even when evidence suggests adjustments are needed. The essence of agility is adaptability, and an overabundance of pride can stifle this, hindering a team's growth and evolution.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Envy (Phthonos)\n\n{{< youtube 4mkwTMMtKls >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/4mkwTMMtKls\" >}})\n\nIn the wisdom of ancient Greece, Phthonos or Envy was a caution against the resentment stemming from seeing others possess what one desires. It was a warning about the dangers of coveting another's success without understanding the journey behind it. In the agile landscape, Martin sheds light on how this envy often manifests when teams and organisations blindly emulate successful agile models, such as the \"Spotify model\", without tailoring them to their unique needs and circumstances. This blind imitation, driven by envy, can lead teams astray, causing them to adopt practices that might not align with their goals or [organisational culture]({{< ref \"/tags/organisational-culture\" >}}). The key takeaway is to focus on one's unique journey, drawing inspiration from others but constantly adapting it to one's context.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Gluttony (Gastrimargia)\n\n{{< youtube 2ASLFX2i9_g >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/2ASLFX2i9_g\" >}})\n\nAncient Greeks perceived Gastrimargia, or Gluttony, as a warning against overindulgence and excess. It wasn't just about food but about consuming more than one's fair share in any aspect of life. In the agile domain, Martin delves into how this gluttony is mirrored in the realm of [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}). He touches upon the tendency of teams to bloat their product backlogs, hoarding tasks and features, often more than they can realistically handle. This overindulgence leads to inefficiencies, with teams spreading themselves too thin, trying to tackle more than they can manage. The essence is to maintain a [lean]({{< ref \"/categories/lean\" >}}) backlog, prioritising tasks that deliver genuine value and avoiding the trap of trying to do everything at once.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Lust (Porneia)\n\n{{< youtube RBZFAxEUQC4 >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/RBZFAxEUQC4\" >}})\n\nIn the annals of ancient Greek thought, Porneia, or Lust, was more than just a passionate desire; it was seen as a form of madness leading to destructive behaviour. It cautioned against being blinded by intense desires, often leading one astray from one's true path. Translating this to the agile world, Martin highlights how Lust manifests as the intense yearning for quick fixes, shortcuts, and silver bullets without investing genuine effort. Teams might be lured by the promise of rapid transformations or the allure of new tools, often neglecting the foundational principles of agile. This can lead to superficial implementations that lack depth and understanding. True agility requires commitment, understanding, and consistent effort, not just fleeting desires.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Greed (Philargyria)\n\n{{< youtube fZLGlqMdejA >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/fZLGlqMdejA\" >}})\n\nIn the philosophical teachings of ancient Greece, Philargyria, or Greed, was depicted as an excessive desire for wealth and possessions, often at the expense of other virtues. It was a reminder of the dangers of placing material gains above all else. In the agile context, Martin discusses how this greed manifests as overemphasising quick returns and immediate gains. Teams might prioritise short-term profits over long-term value, or focus excessively on resource utilisation without considering genuine [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}). This can lead to decisions that might provide immediate benefits but harm the project in the long run. The essence of agile is to deliver consistent value over time, and an overbearing focus on immediate gains can detract from this goal.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Sloth (Acedia)\n\n{{< youtube uCFIW_lEFuc >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/uCFIW_lEFuc\" >}})\n\nIn the ancient Greek ethos, Acedia or Sloth was a warning against a lack of motivation and interest in life. In the agile realm, Martin highlights how Sloth manifests in various forms across teams, organisations, and [leadership]({{< ref \"/categories/leadership\" >}}). A common manifestation is the sheer reluctance or, as he puts it, \"not bothering our arse\" to do what's promised. Teams might claim they're \"doing Agile,\" yet they don't deliver a working product at the end of a Sprint, or they might have convoluted deployment processes out of the developers' control. The absence of an ordered backlog is another telltale sign. This lethargy might stem from a top-down directive to \"do agile\" in environments not suited for it, perhaps due to legacy systems like mainframes. Martin emphasises the importance of honesty and [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}), urging teams to be forthright about their capabilities and limitations.\n\n## The Sins of Agile: Wrath (Thymos)\n\n{{< youtube U18nA0YFgu0 >}}\n\n[Watch the video]({{< relref \"/resources/videos/youtube/U18nA0YFgu0\" >}})\n\nIn the ancient Greek ethos, Thumos, or Wrath, was a caution against unchecked anger and its potential to lead to destruction. It was a reminder of the dangers of letting emotions, especially anger, dictate actions without reason. In the agile context, Martin highlights how wrath manifests in organisations. It's often seen in the inability to accept mistakes or the reluctance to take accountability. This wrathful behaviour can lead to a blame culture, where individuals or teams are more concerned about deflecting blame instead of addressing the root cause of an issue. For instance, when stakeholders question a decision, they might deflect the blame onto the team instead of the [product owner]({{< ref \"/tags/product-owner\" >}}) taking responsibility. Such environments stifle innovation and growth as teams become more risk-averse, fearing the repercussions of making mistakes. This lack of accountability and a blame culture is indicative of an organisation's wrath, preventing it from truly embracing the agile mindset.\n\n## A Reflection\n\nIn reflecting upon these seven cardinal sins of agile, it becomes evident that the challenges faced in modern software development are not just technical but deeply human. Drawing from this rich tapestry of Greek wisdom and Martin's insightful videos, this exploration serves as both a cautionary tale and a guide. It's a journey of introspection, ensuring that as we navigate the agile seas, we remain true to its core principles, fostering innovation, collaboration, and genuine value delivery. 🚀🛤️\n\nThese insights serve as a timely reminder that while agile offers powerful tools for success, they require a genuine commitment to values, principles, and continuous introspection. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of agile, let's be mindful of these pitfalls, ensuring that our journey is not just about delivering software but also about fostering a culture of growth, collaboration, and genuine value. Let's learn from the past, be it ancient Greece or our own missteps, to build a brighter, agile future.\n\nEnjoy these videos?

    "BodyContent": "Many teams grapple with the intricacies of [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}), and one of the most pivotal components is the Sprint Goal. It's not just a fleeting thought or a mere list of tasks; it's a commitment, a promise, and a clear direction.\n\n## TLDR;\n\nThe Sprint Goal is the heart of Scrum, representing the team's commitment to the value derived from the Sprint's outcome. It's the tactical step towards the objectives of the work in progress towards the Product Goal. A well-crafted Sprint Goal is neither granular nor high-level but strikes a balance to ensure clarity, accountability, and [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}).\n\n## The Core of the Sprint Goal\n\nThe Sprint Goal is the commitment made by the [Scrum Team]({{< ref \"/tags/scrum-team\" >}}) to the value derived from the Sprint's outcome. It's the next tactical step towards the objectives of the work underway. This goal should be a clear and concise description of the work the team will undertake during the Sprint so that they can collectively manage the emergent Sprint Backlog. It's not a list of tasks but a unified goal the team strives towards.\n\nWhen teams find it challenging to craft a Sprint Goal that genuinely represents the contents of the Sprint Backlog, they might be aiming for too much granularity (a local optimisation). The Sprint Goal should be the paramount deliverable for which stakeholders will hold the Scrum Team accountable.\n\nConversely, a Sprint Goal that's too high-level can disconnect the work being done from the value being delivered. This can create a chasm between the team and the outcome, diluting accountability.\n\n## Sprint Goal videos!\n\nSome folks prefer to watch than to read :), and we have you covered:\n\n<figure>\n\n{{< youtube 2Cy9MxXiiOo >}}\n\n<figcaption>\n\nThis video sheds light on the concept of a Sprint goal in the Scrum context.

A well-defined Sprint goal sparks intrigue, questions, and enthusiasm among both stakeholders and developers.\n\n## Key things to remember about a Sprint Goal\n\n- **The Sprint Goal connects the team and the stakeholders** - we commit to the Sprint Goal as a team, and we expect the stakeholders to hold us accountable for achieving it. With the Sprint Goal being achieved as the norm, we build trust for the times when we occasionally don't make the Sprint Goal.\n\n- **The Sprint Goal does not need to represent all of the work in the Sprint -** You will also have to plan time in each Sprint for refactoring, refinement, those small changes that are too short for a Sprint, and those ling running pieces of work that take longer.\n\n- [**Delivering usable product to at least some subset of real users every iteration (including the first) and gathering feedback?**](https://nkdagility.com/learn/agile-delivery-kit/guides/detecting-agile-bs/) \\- While we strive to have usable value at the end of every Sprint, different sorts of work have different delivery models, and not all delivery can be sliced in the same way as software. For example, a tunnel is not valuable until both ends are open. This needs to be taken into consideration when crafting Goals.\n\n## When are Sprint Goals crafted?\n\nWhile the Sprint Goal is finalised at the Sprint Planning, it is a good idea to think longer term and draft possible Sprint Goals looking out at least the next few Sprints.\n\nWhile they may change, having some idea of which checkpoints you are thinking of hitting is critical to helping both the team and the stakeholders make better decisions with as much context as makes sense. If you find that you are changing the draft Sprint Goals constantly, then maybe you are looking too far out into the future and need to shorten the forecast.\n\nThis forecast should be sufficient to enhance [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) and will depend on the type of work underway.\n\n## Examples of Sprint Goals\n\nHere are some examples of Sprint's Goals for a cloud migration team migrating applications from on-premises to the cloud. These goals may be delivered in this order over the life of the engagement or partnership with a customer and represent vertical slices of work to be delivered that result in some value.\n\n### SMART Sprint Goals\n\nThese are just example goals, and the specifics will vary based on the organization's needs, the complexity of the applications, and other factors. One way to ensure the validity of each sprint goal is to use SMART goals; each goal is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\n\n1. **Environment Setup Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have a fully configured cloud environment, including virtual networks, security groups, and storage, ready for application deployment.\"\n\n2. **Assessment and Planning Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have identified all dependencies, potential challenges, and the migration strategy for each application.\"\n\n3. **Proof of Concept (PoC) Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have successfully migrated a non-critical application to the cloud and validated its functionality, serving as a PoC for the larger migration.\"\n\n4. **Data Migration Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have migrated 50% of the application data to the cloud without any data loss or corruption.\"\n\n5. **Application Migration Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have migrated and deployed three key applications to the cloud and ensured they are fully operational.\"\n\n6. **Integration Testing Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have completed integration testing for all migrated applications, ensuring they interact seamlessly with other systems.\"\n\n7. **Performance Tuning Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have optimized the performance of all migrated applications, ensuring they meet or exceed on-premises benchmarks.\"\n\n8. **Security and Compliance Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, all migrated applications will be compliant with our security standards, and any vulnerabilities identified will be addressed.\"\n\n9. **User Training and Documentation Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have provided training to all relevant stakeholders on how to use the migrated applications in the cloud environment and created comprehensive documentation.\"\n\n10. **Monitoring and Alerting Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, we will have set up monitoring and alerting tools for all migrated applications, ensuring we are immediately notified of any issues.\"\n\n11. **Final Transition and Decommissioning Sprint Goal** - \"By the end of this sprint, all remaining applications will be fully migrated to the cloud, and on-premises infrastructure will be decommissioned.\"\n\n### OKR Sprint Goals\n\nThis same list can be written as OKR! OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal-setting framework that helps organizations define and track objectives and their outcomes. Here's how the list of Sprint Goals can be converted to OKRs:\n\n**Objective: Successfully migrate applications from on-premises to the cloud.**\n\n**Key Results**\n\n1. **Environment Setup** - KR1: Fully configure the cloud environment, including virtual networks, security groups, and storage.\n\n2. **Assessment and Planning** - KR2: Identify all dependencies, potential challenges, and migration strategies for each application.\n\n3. **Proof of Concept (PoC)** - KR3: Migrate and validate a non-critical application to the cloud as a PoC.\n\n4. **Data Migration** - KR4: Migrate 50% of the application data to the cloud without data loss or corruption.\n\n5. **Application Migration** - KR5: Migrate and deploy three key applications to the cloud, ensuring full operability.\n\n6. **Integration Testing** - KR6: Complete integration testing for all migrated applications with successful interactions.\n\n7. **Performance Tuning** - KR7: Optimize the performance of all migrated applications to meet or exceed on-premises benchmarks.\n\n8. **Security and Compliance** - KR8: Ensure all migrated applications comply with security standards and address any vulnerabilities.\n\n9. **User Training and Documentation** - KR9: Provide training to all relevant stakeholders and create comprehensive documentation.\n\n10. **Monitoring and Alerting** - KR10: Set up monitoring and alerting tools for all migrated applications with immediate notification capabilities.\n\n11. **Final Transition and Decommissioning** - KR12: Fully migrate all remaining applications to the cloud and decommission on-premises infrastructure.\n\nThe Objective sets the overarching goal, while the Key Results break down the specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving that goal.\n\n### Other Goal-definition frameworks\n\nIn addition to the SMART and OKR goals listed above, there are other frameworks that are also viable in this circumstance:\n\n1. **CLEAR Goals**:\n\n   - **C**ollaborative: Goals should encourage teamwork.\n   - **L**imited: Goals should be limited in scope and duration.\n   - **E**motional: Goals should connect to personal and team values or passions.\n   - **A**ppreciable: Break larger goals into smaller tasks.\n   - **R**efinable: Be flexible and adjust goals as needed.\n\n2. **BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)**:\n\n   - A long-term, visionary goal that is more strategic and inspiring than a standard goal.\n\n3. **4DX (The 4 Disciplines of Execution)**:\n\n   - Focus on the Wildly Important Goals (WIGs).\n   - Act on Lead Measures.\n   - Keep a Compelling Scoreboard.\n   - Create a Cadence of Accountability.\n\n4. **FAST Goals**:\n\n   - **F**requently discussed.\n   - **A**mbitious in scope.\n   - **S**pecific and measurable.\n   - **T**ransparent and shared with others.\n\n5. **GROW Model**:\n\n   - Used primarily for [coaching]({{< ref \"/tags/coaching\" >}}) and [mentoring]({{< ref \"/tags/mentoring\" >}}).\n   - **G**oal: What do you want to achieve?\n   - **R**eality: Where are you now concerning the goal?\n   - **O**ptions: What could you do to achieve the goal?\n   - **W**ill (or Way Forward): What will you do?\n\n6. **MBO (Management by Objectives)** - A management model where managers and employees work together to set, monitor, and achieve specific objectives.\n\n7. **Backward Goal Setting** - Start with the end goal and work backwards to determine the steps needed to achieve it.\n\n8. **Process vs. Outcome Goals**:  \n   **Process Goals**: Focus on the actions or strategies needed to reach a goal.  \n   **Outcome Goals**: Focus on the desired end result.\n\nDifferent frameworks and methodologies may be more suitable depending on the context, the nature of the goal, the individual or organization's preferences, and the desired outcome. Choosing a method that aligns with the specific needs and challenges at hand is essential.\n\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nMastering the art of crafting a Sprint Goal is pivotal in the Scrum framework. It's not merely about listing tasks but about setting a clear, concise objective that drives value and aligns with the broader vision. Whether too granular or too high-level, a misaligned Sprint Goal can hinder a team's progress and diminish stakeholder trust. By understanding its essence and ensuring it's tactical and relevant, teams can foster better collaboration, clearer communication, and heightened accountability. Remember, it's not just about completing tasks; it's about delivering value, every Sprint.\n\n## NKDAgility can help!\n\nIf you find it hard to craft effective Sprint Goals or struggle to align your team's objectives with the broader organisational vision, my team at NKDAgility can assist.

    "BodyContent": "The [Definition of Done]({{< ref \"/tags/definition-of-done\" >}}) (DoD) is a sacrosanct measure of quality, ensuring that every piece of work meets the standards necessary for release. On the other hand, acceptance criteria focus on the work's content. Merging the two can risk the integrity of a working, usable product. This article delves into the nuances of maintaining the sanctity of the DoD while ensuring the delivery of valuable increments.\n\n### Why having Acceptance Criteria on the Definition of Done risks the sanctity of the working usable product\n\nThe DoD is my touchstone for quality. It's a measurable and automatable standard that ensures every [increment]({{< ref \"/tags/increment\" >}}) is of a certain quality. Introducing optional or non-executable elements into the DoD can diminish its importance, potentially jeopardising the [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) and empiricism foundational to our work.\n\nThe DoD isn't about guaranteeing functionality but ensuring that what we've built works. It's the bedrock of transparency. If stakeholders are still determining whether the work meets the necessary standards for release, there needs to be more clarity on the additional effort required. Similarly, if Developers are unsure of these standards, they can't accurately gauge the work needed.\n\nIncorporating elements that might undermine this transparency or minimise these standards is a risk we shouldn't take. The DoD's primary purpose is to maintain this clarity.\n\n### Why having Acceptance Criteria on the Definition of Done may not risk the sanctity of the working usable product\n\nThere are instances where quality measures form part of the acceptance criteria. In such cases, one might be tempted to add \"must meet acceptance criteria\" to the DoD. However, this can jeopardise the team's flexibility in determining the Sprint's contents while upholding the DoD's sanctity.\n\nInstead, we should scrutinise the acceptance criteria. If specific criteria always need to be true, they should be incorporated into the standards and, by extension, the DoD. For instance, criteria like \"all content is spelled correctly and has good grammar\" or \"all copy meets visual spacing guidelines\" can be integrated into the DoD.\n\nIf you're keen on including acceptance criteria in the DoD and wish to maintain the flexibility of [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}), consider phrasing it as \"for all work delivered in the Sprint, quality-based acceptance criteria on each backlog item are fulfilled\". This retains the original intent while allowing the team to adapt based on their learnings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe DoD aims to ensure transparency, confirming that all showcased work meets our product's standards. Anything that jeopardises this transparency or the adaptability of Sprint's contents should be approached with caution. Only adopt such changes if you can guarantee the preservation of adaptability and transparency.\n\n\\---\n\n**NKDAgility can help!**\n\nThese are the intricacies that [lean]({{< ref \"/categories/lean\" >}})-agile aficionados thrive on, but most find daunting.

    "BodyContent": "Over the past decade, a recurring query has been echoing in my ears: \"How can we normalise Story Points across teams so that we can look across and maybe compare teams?\" It's high time we address this.\n\n### TLDR;\n\nStory Points, while subjective, can be a valuable tool for team discussions and understanding. However, they shouldn't be the primary metric for comparing teams or predicting future deliverables. Instead, focus on objective metrics like [throughput]({{< ref \"/tags/throughput\" >}}), to gauge and optimise [team performance]({{< ref \"/tags/team-performance\" >}}).\n\n### These are not the metrics that you are looking for!\n\nFirst and foremost, Story Points are inherently subjective. They're influenced by individual perceptions, making them unsuitable for broad comparisons or future projections. While they might offer a vague direction, they're often misused in planning and measuring.\n\nThe essence of [agile frameworks]({{< ref \"/tags/agile-frameworks\" >}}) like [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) is [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}), and the correlation between the subjective nature of story points and their velocity doesn't necessarily equate to the value delivered. There are better choices for teams aiming to optimise their value delivery than relying solely on Story Points and Velocity.\n\n**But is there any value in Story Points?**\n\nAye, there is. In my experience, Story Points can be a great tool during backlog item refinement. They foster discussions, highlighting what's known and, more importantly, what's not: Outliers during planning poker often signal gaps in understanding.\n\nTools like Story Points and Planning Poker can be invaluable in understanding when to dissect items further and spark discussions during refinement. I would expect teams to shift more towards right-sizing, ensuring that backlog items are feasible within a Sprint, as they gain more experience and understanding of the product, its domain, and the technology used.\n\n### A Story of Flow and Value\n\nThe crux of this discourse lies in two vectors: throughput and value.\n\n- **Throughput** is a tangible measure of items delivered over time.\n\n- **Value**, on the other hand, is a more elusive measure of the anticipated benefits from system changes.\n\nIt's straightforward to gauge the throughput of backlog items and their flow. By noting when work enters and exits the system, we can derive the four pivotal flow metrics:\n\n- Throughput\n\n- [Cycle Time]({{< ref \"/tags/cycle-time\" >}})\n\n- Work Item Age\n\n- Work In Process\n\n![](images/image-1280x720-3-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nSuch metrics empower us to make informed decisions rooted in tangible data. They allow us to pinpoint potential issues, identify items needing further breakdown, and employ probabilistic [forecasting]({{< ref \"/tags/forecasting\" >}}) for future projections.\n\nSimultaneously, to truly maximise team output, we must also focus on the value of the work. Given its subjective nature, defining value can be multifaceted. A practical approach is to examine the four primary value areas from evidence-based management practices:\n\n- **[Current Value]({{< ref \"/tags/current-value\" >}})** - Evaluating the existing product's value. Is it meeting customer expectations?\n\n- **[Unrealised Value]({{< ref \"/tags/unrealised-value\" >}})** \\- Identifying gaps in your product that could be filled.\n\n- **[Time to Market]({{< ref \"/tags/time-to-market\" >}})** - Assessing the speed from ideation to user engagement. Dormant value is essentially no value.\n\n- **[Ability to Innovate]({{< ref \"/tags/ability-to-innovate\" >}})** \\- Determining the balance between maintenance and innovation.\n\n![](images/image-1-1280x717-1-1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe ultimate goal is to enhance both throughput and value concurrently. Striking a balance is crucial; we neither want sluggish excellence nor a barrage of mediocrity.\n",

    "BodyContent": "**[Software Development]({{< ref \"/tags/software-development\" >}})** is not just a systematic process but a dynamic interplay of critical work that shapes the progress of your product. A **[Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}})** team's work can be classified into **Sprint** work and **Refinement**. To steer your **[Scrum Team]({{< ref \"/tags/scrum-team\" >}})** towards success, it's essential to understand, manage, and balance these two types of work. This article dives deep into the heart of Scrum team operations, offering clear-cut strategies and innovative visualisation techniques to help you understand and manage your Sprint work and Refinement processes effectively. Decode the intricacies of Scrum teamwork and unlock the path to achieving your product goals with increased efficiency.\n\n## TLDR;\n\nThis post analyses two types of work a Scrum Team typically undertakes: Sprint work and Refinement. **Sprint work** involves changes that lead to a tangible alteration in the product [increment]({{< ref \"/tags/increment\" >}}), while **Refinement** consists of activities that substantively alter the [Product Backlog]({{< ref \"/tags/product-backlog\" >}}). Sprint Work adds direct value to the stakeholders, while Refinement sets the stage for future Sprint Work. The challenge lies in striking a balance between these types of work, ensuring an efficient workflow. To visualise this work, the article recommends using platforms like **#AzureDevOps** that offer mechanisms for tracking both Sprint Work and Refinement, ensuring seamless [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}).\n\n## The Intricacies of Sprint Work and Refinement\n\nEvery Scrum Team juggles two kinds of work - Sprint Work and Refinement. While they may seem different, they're two sides of the same coin, intrinsically tied together.\n\n**Sprint Work** involves anything that directly contributes to the Sprint Backlog. It could be discovery, development, validation, or delivery tasks that significantly change the state of the **Product Increment**. This work directly adds value to the stakeholders and propels the product forward.\n\nOn the other hand, **Refinement** is the work done against the Product Backlog. It could involve ideation, discovery, proofing, decomposition, sizing, or other activities that significantly change the **Product Backlog**. This is less direct value, but Refinement is critical to a Scrum Team's success. It sets the stage for future Sprint Work by getting the Backlog Items \"ready\" for the Scrum Team to bring into the Sprint.\n\nRefinement helps prepare for surprises by allowing the Scrum Team space to provide prerequisites and other inputs for the Backlog items before they are brought into the Sprint. It helps reduce the chance of unforeseen issues that could have been avoided. The challenge, however, is to prevent over-preparation that leads to unnecessary work – it's all about finding the 'Goldilocks zone' of balance between too much and too little.\n\n### Visualising Refinement\n\nVisualising this work plays a crucial role in keeping track of project progress. With its robust mechanisms, Azure [DevOps]({{< ref \"/categories/devops\" >}}) is an excellent tool to help visualise without pulling all those backlog items that are not yet \"ready\" into the Sprint.\n\nTo track the refinement work in the Board, create a new column named 'Refinement' and map it to the \"Approved\" or \"New\" state, depending on the process used. This column will contain Backlog Items that need to be refined to \"ready\" before they are candidates for the Sprint.\n\n<figure>\n\n![](images/image-1-1280x653-1-1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n<figcaption>\n\n[Azure DevOps]({{< ref \"/tags/azure-devops\" >}}) Board showing Refining Column with Tasks\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor the Taskboard, change the Iteration Path of the tasks to that of the current Sprint, which is the default for new items created within the context of a team. This change will display the task on the Taskboard and pull a shadow of the Backlog Item in for context for these tasks.\n\n<figure>\n\n![](images/image-1280x652-3-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n<figcaption>\n\nAzure DevOps Taskboard showing grey PBI not in Sprint with Tasks in Sprint.\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThese two capabilities are critical to being able to visualise the work that is happening while maintaining the separation of the transparencies of the Sprint and Product backlogs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding and managing the balance between Sprint Work and Refinement is critical for a Scrum Team's success. By visualising these tasks effectively, your team can plan and execute tasks efficiently, avoiding unnecessary work and being prepared for potential roadblocks.\n\nBy dedicating enough time to Refinement, teams gain a comprehensive understanding of what's necessary, preparing them to effectively manage upcoming tasks and potential challenges. Therefore, visualising all work in progress allows for smoother [product management]({{< ref \"/categories/product-management\" >}}) and promotes a thorough understanding of the product's needs, fostering more informed, efficient, and successful Scrum operations.\n\n**#Agile** **#TeamWork** **#Productivity**\n",

    "BodyContent": "As I sit here, sipping my morning cup of tea, I ponder the current state of [organisational agility]({{< ref \"/tags/organisational-agility\" >}}). I've been in this game long enough to have seen the rise and fall of various methodologies, each promising to be the silver bullet that will solve all of an organisation's woes. I was initially an ALM consultant, then [DevOps]({{< ref \"/categories/devops\" >}}). But, as I've often found, the reality is far from the promise.\n\n### TLDR;\n\nThe crux of the matter is this: the goal isn't to be 'agile' or to implement SAFe, or Nexus, or [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}})@Scale. The true objective is for your organisation to have the ability to seize opportunities faster than our competitors, pivot more swiftly, and handle surprises with more **_agility_**. The world is moving at a breakneck pace, and the old system of rules and procedures is no longer sufficient. It's time for organisations to rebuild their processes from the ground up, tailored to their unique needs and market niches. The survival of the fittest applies not just to the animal kingdom but to the corporate world as well.\n\n### **The Misconception of the Agile-Waterfall Hybrid**\n\nI've often heard that an agile-waterfall hybrid model is the way forward for organisations that aren't particularly keen on removing the policies and procedures that would enable them to respond rapidly to market changes. I can't help but face-palm at this. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it just doesn't work.\n\nThe point isn't to be 'agile' or to implement SAFe, Nexus, or Scrum@Scale. These are means to an end, not the end itself. The true goal is to seize opportunities faster than our competitors, pivot more swiftly, and handle surprises with more agility. It's about being the hare in a world full of tortoises.\n\nEvery successful large organisation has built its processes and practices from the ground up as it grew. It tailored its approach to suit its unique needs and market niches. It's like a bespoke suit - it fits perfectly because it's made just for it. If building a bespoke set of processes and practices is what made your organisation successful in the first place, why would one think that installing someone else's process and practices would lead to the same success?\n\nThe world is moving at a breakneck pace, and those niches within which your organisation was successful are now constantly changing. The old rules and procedures need to be revised.\n\n> **No one has to change**. Survival is optional.\n>\n> \\- Dr. Deming\n\nAround 99% of all animal species that ever existed are extinct. What percentage of all \"companies\" that ever existed are, too? We know that 70% of all startups fail in the first year, 50% don't last 5.\n\nMany of the big companies seem is repeatedly unable to adapt to the ever-changing markets, but their existing cash reserves protect them from failure. It will not last forever...\n\nIt's time for organisations to wake up and smell the coffee. The race for market responsiveness is on, and those who adapt will be kept up. It's not about being 'agile' or implementing SAFe - it's about being able to seize opportunities, pivot, and handle surprises faster than our competitors. It's about survival of the fittest.\n",

    "BodyContent": "As someone who has spent a fair amount of time in the trenches of [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}), I've realised that the language we use to describe our work can profoundly shape our approach to it. One term that I believe has been misused and misunderstood to the point of causing more harm than good is \"User Stories\".\n\n### TLDR;\n\nIn this post, I argue that we should stop using the term \"User Stories\" in the system we use to store our work and conversations. Instead, we should adopt a generic term like \"[Product Backlog]({{< ref \"/tags/product-backlog\" >}}) Item\" to provide a more flexible and transparent framework for describing our work. This change will allow us to avoid the pitfalls of forcing all our work into a user story format and ultimately lead to more effective product development.\n\nIt may seem pedantic, but I encounter this often with teams.\n\n### The Problem with User Stories\n\n\"User Stories\" has become a staple in many development teams' lexicon. However, I've observed that it often leads to tunnel vision, where people try to shoehorn every piece of work into a user story format, even when it doesn't make sense.\n\nFor instance, consider these examples:\n\n- \"_As a developer, I want to have some documentation so that I know what I am doing_\" instead of simply saying, \"Update the documentation.\"\n\n- \"_As a [Product Owner]({{< ref \"/tags/product-owner\" >}}), I want to support 10k simultaneous users, so that I can serve more transactions_\" instead of just stating, \"Must support 10k simultaneous users.\"\n\nIn these cases, the user story format adds unnecessary complexity and can even obscure the work's true nature. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it's not only difficult but also distorts the original shape of the peg.\n\nA Better Approach: Product Backlog Items\n\nI propose replacing \"User Stories\" with a more generic term: \"Product Backlog Item\". This term refers to an item in your list of things to do, without any assumptions about its format or structure.\n\n> Yes, I know I'm slightly biased as a [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}) Trainer, and \"PBI\" or \"Product Backlog Item\" is my comfort terminology. How about \"Rock\" or \"Item\" instead?\n\nThis change will give the author of the work the freedom to write backlog items in the way that best communicates their content. It will also help to avoid the confusion and miscommunication that can arise from trying to force all work into a user story format.\n\nConsider the freedom and clarity that comes with writing \"Update the documentation\" or \"Must support 10k simultaneous users\". These statements are direct, clear, and free from the constraints of the user story format. They allow the creator to express the work to be done in the most effective way possible, maximising the [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) of the content.\n\nI should note that I have no problem with the user story format when we are talking about genuine **_user_** stories. But if there is no user then there is no user story.\n\n### The Impact of Language on Product Development\n\nLanguage is not just a tool for communication - it also shapes our thinking and our behaviour. In the realm of product development, the terms we use to describe our work can influence how we approach it, organise it, and understand it.\n\nBy using the term \"User Stories\", we implicitly endorse a specific way of thinking about our work that may not always be helpful or appropriate. We encourage people to think about user needs and benefits, even when there are more effective ways to describe the work to be done. This is perfectly valid when the context supports it.\n\nBy switching our naming to \"Product Backlog Items\", we can free ourselves from these constraints and open up new possibilities for thinking about and organising our work. We can create a more flexible and adaptable framework for product development that is better suited to our work's complex and varied nature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLanguage matters in product development. We can improve communication, increase transparency, and ultimately build better products by rethinking how we describe our work. So let's say goodbye to \"User Stories\" and hello to \"Product Backlog Items\". Let's embrace a more flexible and transparent approach to product development, one that recognises the complexity and diversity of our work and gives us the freedom to describe it in the most effective way possible.\n",

    "BodyContent": "In the realm of [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}), crafting an efficient [Product Backlog]({{< ref \"/tags/product-backlog\" >}}) is an endeavour akin to sculpting a masterpiece. Just as sculptors chisel away the excess marble to reveal the form within, product managers must carefully mould their backlog, ensuring it's a [lean]({{< ref \"/categories/lean\" >}}) inventory that reflects the unrealized value of the product. The Product Backlog must encapsulate our current aspirations for the product while being transparent and understandable to all stakeholders. It’s a living artefact that dynamically evolves with the product. However, we must also resist the temptation to create an overwhelming catalogue that loses its sharpness and becomes a weight dangling around the team's neck.\n\n## TLDR;\n\nIn essence, the Product Backlog should be minimal yet sufficient. While keeping the backlog lean is imperative, it’s also prudent to consider future implications to mitigate surprises. Working in complex environments necessitates understanding the fine line between the unforeseen and the overlooked. Regular reflection on the accomplished work, the surprises encountered, and retrospective analysis of these surprises are essential.\n\n## A Delicate Balance Between Lean Inventory and Future Readiness\n\nStarting with the basics, the Product Backlog is a lean inventory of everything we understand is needed to enhance the product. It should be easy to grasp and must reflect the product's unrealized value. The value that we believe is needed for the success of the product. [Transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) and clarity are key – stakeholders and team members should be able to understand and articulate the contents of the backlog effortlessly.\n\n_When the backlog becomes a labyrinthine tome, it loses its efficacy._\n\nWhile keeping the backlog lean is essential, one must not be myopic. Product development is not an isolated undertaking. It occurs within a complex, ever-changing environment. Therefore, the ability to look ahead and around is vital. However, what is the optimum distance one should look into the future? Here lies the conundrum. Looking too far ahead might lead to time wasted on obsolete aspects. Conversely, not looking far enough might result in missed opportunities. This necessitates finding the sweet spot – the Goldilocks zone.\n\nWe should look to find that Goldilocks zone for every aspect of the Product Backlog. What is the [lead time]({{< ref \"/tags/lead-time\" >}}) for things that your team needs that others have? How long are the changes that we need likely to take? These answers will lead us to that minimal but sufficient answer. Will we always be right? Heck no! We will often be wrong, but hopefully, we can minimise the wrong and adapt to the changing context of the market and business needs.\n\nAs we traverse the product development landscape, surprises are inevitable. However, not all surprises are born equal. Some are genuine unknowns, while others are oversights masquerading as surprises. Dissecting these surprises afterwards and categorising them into those two buckets is crucial. This exercise can unveil insights into overlooked aspects and, more importantly, inform future strategies for better anticipating these surprises.\n\n_Perhaps it would be a good idea to meet regularly and reflect on the work done, our surprises, and how we could have handled them better._\n\nFinally, it’s essential to recognize that the Product Backlog is not a static artefact. It's akin to a sculpture that is continuously refined. As product managers and team members, we are the sculptors. Our chisels and hammers are the insights we gain from continuous reflection and learning. The final sculpture is a Product Backlog that embodies disciplined elegance – lean, sufficient, and just forward-looking enough to be helpful.\n\n**_Is your product backlog a lean inventory of your team's best guess at the unreleased value your product needs to maximise the ROI for your stakeholders?_**\n",

    "BodyContent": "The [Product Backlog]({{< ref \"/tags/product-backlog\" >}}) is a critical asset in Agile [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}); it represents a dynamic [lean]({{< ref \"/categories/lean\" >}}) inventory of everything the product needs. For those of us navigating the multifaceted landscape of product development, there is often an impulse to seek an ideal structure for the Product Backlog. The familiar hierarchy of Initiative->Epic->Feature->User Story->Task/Bug is a common schema. However, before embracing this structure as a silver bullet, it’s imperative to critically evaluate the implications of imposing a hierarchy on the Product Backlog and to recognize the nuanced dynamics of working in complex environments. In this article, I will examine the delicate interplay between Product Backlog management and the intrinsic nature of complex systems.\n\n### TLDR;\n\nIn conclusion, while the allure of hierarchy in the Product Backlog might be tempting, it is imperative to recognize that this may not be the panacea it seems. Complex product development demands a more nuanced approach. This entails acknowledging the fluid nature of complex environments, valuing emergent practices over best practices, and empowering teams to harness their expertise. By doing so, we move towards creating not just successful products but also fostering a culture that is adaptable, innovative, and resilient in the face of complexity.\n\n### The Illusion of Order: The Lure of Hierarchy\n\nHierarchy appeals to the human psyche because it seems to present a sense of order and control, especially in the face of complexity. However, this allure of hierarchy can be deceptive. In practice, hierarchy can introduce rigidity, create barriers to communication, and obfuscate what’s genuinely significant in the Product Backlog.\n\nIn essence, when the Backlog is cluttered with levels of hierarchy, it diminishes its [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) and malleability. It is critical to appreciate that the Product Backlog should generally encompass **_value_**. This is not to say we should dispense with additional content that provides context or clarification. Indeed, collateral materials such as wikis can be invaluable in offering insights. However, incorporating these directly into the Product Backlog does not add value and instead restrains the Backlog's fluidity and transparency.\n\n### A Primer on Complexity\n\nAs a side point, engaging in a dialogue about the nature of complexity is imperative whenever the concept of “best practice” is brought up in discussions. Complexity is not just a buzzword; it’s a theoretical framework for understanding how different system components interact. In complex environments, it is impossible to predict outcomes with certainty due to the interdependencies and interactions among the components. This is a far cry from simple or complicated environments, where cause-and-effect relationships can be determined.\n\n![From the Cynefin Institute on https://thecynefin.co/](images/cynefin-institute-complexity-1-1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIn simple environments, “best practices” exist because they offer tried and true methods for known problems. However, there are only emergent practices in complex environments where doing the same thing again can often have very different results. These practices cannot be predicted upfront and may only be effective temporarily. The most pragmatic approach in such environments is to start with a hypothesis, experiment, and be prepared to evolve the practice based on feedback and learning.\n\n### Ghosts from the Past: The Work Breakdown Structure\n\nOne of the reasons that hierarchy is so enticing is that it has historical roots in the traditional [project management]({{< ref \"/tags/project-management\" >}}) approach known as the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. While the WBS was valuable in certain contexts, its hierarchical nature is not conducive to the [Agile philosophy]({{< ref \"/tags/agile-philosophy\" >}}), which values responsiveness to change over following a plan.\n\n![Work Breakdown example](images/nkdagility-Rethinking-Product-Backlog-hierarchy-1269x720-3-3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n> A work breakdown structure (WBS) visually organizes project deliverables into different levels based on dependencies. It’s essentially your project plan in a visual form, with your project objective at the top, then dependencies and sub-dependencies below. -Alicia Raeburn, Asana\n\nInterestingly, the very presence of a hierarchy resembling the WBS within the Product Backlog may lead to individuals subconsciously reverting to old habits. This is not surprising as the human psyche finds comfort in familiarity; there is a tendency to revert to what we know. This, however, is akin to trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, as opposed to rethinking the fundamental paradigm of managing work.\n\nA simple question to ask yourself when you open an item on your backlog is this:\n\n> \"Does this item from my backlog, on its own, represent some value to the business? Can it be delivered independantly?\"\n\n**If the answer is no, it's not a backlog item but a work task!**\n\n### The Flat Landscape: A Paradigm Shift\n\nInstead of obfuscating the Product Backlog with layers of hierarchy, consider streamlining it to encompass just the work pertinent to the team.\n\nYou can still employ tags, wikis, and attachments to provide context. This approach liberates team members to structure the Backlog in a way that makes sense to them and is responsive to the fluid nature of complex product development.\n\nI think it's worth highlighting that strategy should inform but not dictate the choices made in organizing the Product Backlog. This is a crucial point. The reason organizations hire skilled individuals is to leverage their expertise and insights. There is a recognition that those closest to the work often have the most meaningful insights into what needs to be done.\n\n### Complexity and Cognition: The Human Factor\n\nIn complex product development, human cognition is a significant factor. Individuals and interactions are central to Agile principles. People come with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. These differences can be a source of creativity and innovation. By flattening the Product Backlog, we create an environment where the team's cognitive diversity can flourish.\n\nFurthermore, in complex systems, a practice known as [sensemaking]({{< ref \"/tags/sensemaking\" >}}) becomes critical. Sensemaking involves assimilating information, interpreting it, and making informed judgments. A flat Product Backlog supports sensemaking as it reduces cognitive overload and allows individuals to focus on what’s truly important.\n\n### Strategy and Autonomy: The Balancing Act\n\nThe relationship between strategy and the Product Backlog is subtle. The strategy should serve as a compass, providing direction and purpose, helping us orienteer to our destination. However, it should not be a straitjacket. The dynamism of complex environments requires that teams have the autonomy to make decisions and adapt as necessary. There needs to be a balance between strategic alignment and autonomy. This balance is vital for harnessing the collective intelligence and creativity of the team.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create a resilient, adaptable ecosystem capable of thriving amidst the uncertainties of complex product development. This involves creating flexible structures, fostering a culture that values learning and adaptation, and equipping teams with the autonomy to make decisions.\n\n**_What's in your backlog?_**\n",

    "BodyContent": "As a seasoned Agile consultant, I find myself amidst conversations about the mechanics of a successful Agile project. Today, I focus on an essential yet often underappreciated aspect - the [Product Backlog]({{< ref \"/tags/product-backlog\" >}}). A well-ordered Product Backlog that is comprehensible to all stakeholders is a critical beacon that illuminates the path to a transparent future.\n\nAt the foundational level, the Product Backlog is simply a list of items required for a product, encompassing features, enhancements, and fixes. These items, sometimes called ‘User Stories’, are critical to understanding what needs to be built. The Product Backlog must be seen as a living document, which evolves as the market conditions, customer needs, and product goals change.\n\nAs we dive deeper into this subject, it’s vital to recognize the significance of ordering the contents of the Product Backlog. Ordering entails sequencing Backlog Items based on value, risk, size, and learning. This exercise ensures that the team focuses on the most valuable and relevant items first.\n\n<figure>\n\n[![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQGhRSjX-1LpxA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1687358856177?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=kIwD0zG9AHgaTekSY1aV6ngXWGeQh3n1pz6W-LYDzEA)](https://nkdagility.com/training-courses/[scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}})-training-courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-with-certification/)\n{ .post-img }\n\n<figcaption>\n\nFrom Scrum.org [Professional Scrum]({{< ref \"/tags/professional-scrum\" >}}) User Experience\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe next layer to unravel is the importance of well-articulated Backlog Items. Crafting these Backlog Items with sufficient details ensures all team members and stakeholders easily understand them. This exercise should be iterative, incorporating feedback to refine and improve the Backlog Items.\n\nMoving further, let’s examine the refinement of the Product Backlog. Refinement is an ongoing process to ensure the Backlog Items are manageable and can be feasibly completed in an Iteration. The word refinement represents any work done by the team on the Product Backlog rather than on the [increment]({{< ref \"/tags/increment\" >}}) itself. It involves breaking down more oversized items into smaller, more manageable chunks and continually reassessing their order.\n\nOne of the activities that happen during refinement is sizing. Sizing involves understanding the size of each Backlog Item. This size understanding assists in determining how many Backlog Items can be completed in a single Iteration and aids in release planning.\n\nNow, with a well-ordered and refined Product Backlog in place, we pave the way for a continuous orienteering process. This is where the real magic happens. It enables the team to set their sights on the next tactical objective consistently, often called a Sprint Goal. This, in turn, guides them towards the intermediate strategic aim, the Product Goal, and eventually, the overarching strategic goal or vision.\n\n[![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQH2Q7W_4PcFqg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1687360102712?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=Fp77tTqOSeSgE9YCt5M05X8ht5cKZ8uytpABgav35Rw)](https://nkdagility.com/training-courses/scrum-training-courses/professional-agile-[leadership]({{< ref \"/categories/leadership\" >}})-with-evidence-based-management-pal-ebm-with-certification/)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe delineation of goals can be articulated in many ways, while you can choose your own OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are quite popular and add value if used well. If used poorly they can be a significant impediment to [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}). The value of OKRs lies in aligning objective data points of critical results with the subjective outcome of the objective. It’s essential to remember that while data and OKRs offer guidance, they are not constraints. The paramount focus should always be on the outcomes that furnish greater value to the customer.\n\nIn conclusion, an ordered Product Backlog serves as an astrolabe that guides your vessel through the murky waters of [product development]({{< ref \"/categories/product-development\" >}}). If well refined through order, discussion, and sizing, it becomes an indispensable instrument for navigation, continually orienteering towards goals that ultimately culminate in a value-driven product.\n\nAs stewards of Agile [Product Management]({{< ref \"/categories/product-management\" >}}), let’s uphold the art and science of meticulously curating a Product Backlog. It’s not merely a list, but a compendium of aspirations that build the bridge to a transparent and flourishing future.\n",

    "BodyContent": "In [software development]({{< ref \"/tags/software-development\" >}}), an increasingly prevalent phenomenon is the adoption of agile methodologies, akin to individuals embarking on fitness journeys through gym memberships. However, a striking parallel between the two realms can be drawn – the misuse and under-utilization of the tools at disposal. The essence of this analogy reflects a more fundamental notion: the gap between intention and implementation.\n\nBuying a gym membership is often the first step in the fitness world. It symbolises the recognition of the necessity to adopt a healthier lifestyle. However, obtaining a membership doesn’t miraculously bestow the benefits of a toned physique or improved cardiovascular health. The gym membership must be coupled with consistent visits, well-planned workout regimes, and monitored nutrition. This membership often lies dormant, with the individual not reaping any potential benefits.\n\nEnter the corporate world. Like gym enthusiasts, companies seeking to improve software delivery often adopt agile methodologies. The decision to move towards agile is commendable, analogous to procuring a gym membership. It stems from the realisation that traditional waterfall models might not cater to customers' rapidly evolving demands and the market's dynamism. However, companies often need to improve in the implementation phase, like unused gym memberships.\n\nThe genesis of faltering agile implementations can often be traced back to superficial adoption. Agile, in its essence, is not merely a set of practices but a philosophical shift. It’s a mindset that values collaboration, iterative progress, and [customer satisfaction]({{< ref \"/tags/customer-satisfaction\" >}}). Just like how merely stepping into a gym doesn't equate to fitness, implementing daily stand-ups or sprints doesn’t render a company agile. The superficial adoption does little to address deep-rooted issues such as silos, opaque communication channels, and misaligned goals.\n\nNow, let’s dive deeper. Agile requires the company to break down larger goals into smaller, achievable targets when properly implemented. This is quite akin to breaking down fitness goals into sets and reps. Furthermore, like how individuals need to constantly assess their progress, adapt to plateaus, and perhaps change routines, agile methodologies require regular reflection through retrospectives.\n\nAgile also requires teams to be cross-functional like an individual should focus on a balanced workout regime that spans cardio, strength training, and flexibility. Teams need to have diversity in skill sets, and, more importantly, they should be able to rely on each other's expertise to solve problems collectively.\n\nIn a well-implemented agile framework, quality is not compromised. Like a gym-goer shouldn’t sacrifice form for heavier weights, development teams shouldn’t sacrifice software quality to meet arbitrary deadlines. [Technical debt]({{< ref \"/tags/technical-debt\" >}}), similar to injuries in the gym, can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nTo encapsulate, adopting agile methodologies is akin to undertaking a fitness journey. Both require commitment, discipline, consistent effort, and the wisdom to understand that superficial participation yields minimal benefits. Both realms require the participants to learn, adapt, and grow constantly. Understanding that the journey is as important as the destination in both cases is imperative.

    "BodyContent": "In light of the importance professional teams place on delivering usable, working products, I find myself compelled to address the woes that befall teams that need to adhere to this crucial tenet. We understand the need for working products; now, let us dissect the perils of straying from this righteous path.\n\n### TL;DR;\n\nNeglecting to deliver a usable product at the end of each iteration breeds an ecosystem of compounding issues. From eroding trust to [technical debt]({{< ref \"/tags/technical-debt\" >}}) and from sluggish adaptability to misaligned expectations, the outcomes go from bad to worse. Inspection and adaption should be our guide, helping us navigate towards professionalism and quality.\n\n### **What happens when we ignore usable working product?**\n\n**Erosion of Trust with Stakeholders:** Imagine walking into a store to purchase a laptop, only to be handed the bits and pieces with a pat on the back for your ‘future’ computer. The retailer can’t fathom why your faith dwindles. Similarly, with each iteration bereft of a usable product, the trust vested in you by stakeholders wears thin. Like sand slipping through fingers, trust is painfully hard to regain once lost.\n\n**Tsunami of Technical Debt:** With each iteration that lacks a tangible product, you’re essentially signing IOUs against your future. This accrues as Technical Debt – a mammoth wave looming on the horizon. The resources required to address this increase exponentially as the interest piles on. Continuing down this road with abandon results in nothing but pain and suffering for everyone involved.\n\n**Sluggish Adaptability – The Quicksand:** In the ever-changing landscape of customer needs, adaptability is key. Delivering usable increments is akin to the agile footing on uncertain terrain. When teams neglect this, it is like walking in quicksand – the more they struggle without clear direction, the deeper they sink. The lethargy in adaptation will drag them down as the world moves on; without them.\n\n**Misaligned Expectations – A Compass Gone Haywire:** A usable product at the end of iterations acts as the compass, keeping stakeholders and the team aligned. Without this neither you nor your stakeholders have any [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) of what is going on and where we have arrived. The stakeholders expected one thing but got another, and the chasm between them widens with every iteration that the expectations are not validated.  We often get so far apart that we can’t see how we bridge that gap!\n\n**Decreased Morale – The Fading Flame:** Morale is the lifeblood of creativity and productivity. Delivering a working product is the kindling that keeps this fire alive in the team. Being able to see how the stakeholders use the product, are engaged by what we are creating, and care about the outcomes are the foundation of team morale. If we can’t see the stakeholders care about what we are creating, Im not sure why we would care…\n\n**Feedback Drought – direction-lessness:** How do we know that we are heading in the right direction without feedback. When we encounter an obstacle and have to go around, how to we reorientate on the direction to go? Our usable working product is like our compass, allowing us to orienteer as effectively as we can towards our destination.  Without it, you’re navigating blind, guessing the direction based on our assumptions.\n\nUsable working product, every iteration, including the first, is the bedrock upon which we build the pillars of trust, alignment, adaptability, and quality. It is the very foundation of inspection and adaptation. Without it, we have no transparency, inspection, or adaptation!\n\nWithout it, we are not agile.\n",

    "BodyContent": "It baffles me how some agile teams, who claim to be the pioneers of modernity, are living in archaic times where usable working products are as rare as unicorns! Just a heads-up, my dear agile practitioners: the linchpin of Agile is a Usable Working Product. Yes, you read it right!\n\n**TL;DR;**\n\nThe only way to mitigate risk when employing Agile practices is by continuously delivering a usable working product. Agile is not about spinning the hamster wheels but delivering shippable increments that users can interact with. A fortress of documentation can’t protect you from the market’s ever-changing demands. Feedback loops, [value delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/value-delivery\" >}}), and [engineering excellence]({{< ref \"/categories/engineering-excellence\" >}}) are your protection in agile [product delivery]({{< ref \"/tags/product-delivery\" >}}).\n\nLet’s get down to brass tacks.\n\n**Usable Working Product is Your Silver Bullet**\n\nWhen I say \"usable working product,\" I mean a gleaming software [increment]({{< ref \"/tags/increment\" >}}) that is free from known glitches and worthy of release. The agile realm is not a place for code maestros who build fanciful algorithms that never see the light of day. It’s about Developers who can craft a functional product that actual users can validate and provide feedback on.\n\nBut wait! The naysayers will say, \"What about documentation? Isn’t that important too?\" Of course, documentation is vital, but let’s not build the Great Wall of China with it! Excessive documentation in Agile is like wearing a suit of armour to run a marathon – ridiculously cumbersome and defeating the purpose.\n\n### **Just fix the Bugs FFS!**\n\nImagine a ship with a tiny hole in its hull. Ignore it, and soon you’ll find yourself in an unsolicited swimming lesson. Known errors or exceptions are those tiny holes. If you discover a bug, get your toolset out and patch it up. Too big? Bring it to the [Product Owner]({{< ref \"/tags/product-owner\" >}})’s attention and prioritise its fix. Having a “manage-the-bug” mentality is like welcoming water into the ship.\n\nJust fix them.\n\n### **Feedback Loops – Your Vanguard Against Rework**\n\nDo you know what’s better than finding and fixing bugs? Not having them in the first place! How, you ask? Continuous feedback loops. I cannot stress this enough – the more you engage with the stakeholders, the better you understand their requirements and expectations. Your code should dance to the tunes of the customer’s needs. Shorter feedback loops mean you are constantly in tune with what’s needed and can adapt before significant damage is done.\n\nConstant rework of features because of a perceived bug or inconsistency from what’s needed creates significant waste for companies.\n\nIndeed the data suggests that only 35%\\* of the features we build are actually of value to our customers.\n\n\\*From the Chaos Report, Standish Group.\n\n### **Manual Tests – The Antithesis of Agility**\n\nManual tests in Agile are like trying to catch bullets with your teeth – utterly absurd and dangerous. This isn’t a magic show; it’s serious business. Automation is king in Agile. Embrace it, nurture it. Manual tests are not just time-consuming; they are the loophole that regression loves. Automation is the sensors that protect your product from unintended problems.\n\n> “The reason you don't have time to write fast automated tests for your code is because you didn't write fast automated tests for your code.” – Jason Gorman, Codemanship Ltd.\n\n### **Keep It [Lean]({{< ref \"/categories/lean\" >}}) and Mean**\n\nIt’s a battlefield out there. The markets are evolving faster than ever before. Your protection in this ruthless world is a lean, mean, and functional product. It’s not about delivering a magnum opus in one go; it’s about iterative development that aligns with the market demands. You need to be swift, adaptive and focused. Trim down the documentation, automate your processes, and concentrate on delivering a product ready to face the real world.\n\n### **Conclusion: Be Agile, Truly**\n\nSo create a usable working product on a regular cadence, close the feedback loops, and leverage as much automation as possible. Use documentation as part of your strategy but just enough to get buy.\n\nStay connected to the market and business demands and create a usable working product of the highest possible value!\n\nThis is the way!\n",

    "BodyContent": "As the [software development]({{< ref \"/tags/software-development\" >}}) landscape evolves, evaluating the time-tested traditional [project management]({{< ref \"/tags/project-management\" >}}) strategies alongside the burgeoning agile methodologies is essential. The central tenet I would like to explore today is comparing using usable working products as a risk mitigation strategy in Agile with the elaborate documentation characteristic of traditional project management.\n\n### TL;DR:\n\nAgile's emphasis on incremental development with [working software]({{< ref \"/tags/working-software\" >}}) mitigates risks efficiently by validating real-world use early and continuously. Traditional project management often leans towards exhaustive documentation, which, although it provides an essential framework, can be sluggish and less adaptive to change. While documentation is crucial, Agile’s approach to building usable increments might prove more valuable in the rapidly evolving product world.\n\n### Agile's Usable Working Products\n\nAgile approaches, such as [Scrum]({{< ref \"/categories/scrum\" >}}), lay the foundation for teams to focus on delivering working software incrementally. This pragmatic strategy creates an environment where the product is continuously validated, improved, and adapted to customer needs and market conditions. Through [DevOps]({{< ref \"/categories/devops\" >}}) practices and automation, [engineering excellence]({{< ref \"/categories/engineering-excellence\" >}}) forms the backbone of this approach.\n\nPicture this - Your team is building an innovative web application. By focusing on creating minimal product and incrementally adding features through [continuous integration]({{< ref \"/tags/continuous-integration\" >}}) and deployment, you swiftly detect issues, adjust to market changes, and receive customer feedback. Essentially, you have a pulse on the real-world application of your product.\n\nThis brings me to the very essence of why Agile is increasingly alluring - Continuous Validation and Adaptation. It’s the ability to say, “Here’s what we built; let’s test, deploy, and improve.” You sidestep the monolithic menace of releasing a massive project only to discover that some features are irrelevant, or worse, the product is plagued with issues.\n\nHowever, Agile's approach demands a high degree of discipline, collaboration, and [transparency]({{< ref \"/tags/transparency\" >}}) among team members. Moreover, the working product might be partial in terms of features but must be free from critical defects.\n\n### Traditional Project Management’s Documentation\n\nTraditional project management, often associated with Waterfall methodology, emphasises thorough documentation and upfront planning. Every requirement, specification, and design element is meticulously detailed. This documentation can serve as an essential blueprint, ensuring that everyone is on the same page, literally.\n\nHowever, extensive documentation might lead you down a path where adaptation is strenuous. As we know, change is the only constant, especially in technology. What if a competitor launches a similar product, or there’s a shift in customer preferences? Rigid adherence to documentation without real-world validation until late in the project could spell catastrophe.\n\nDon’t get me wrong – Documentation is vital, but less so than working product. But should it be the centre stage, or can it be adaptive?\n\n### Striking the Balance\n\nAgile’s approach to delivering working products empowers teams to build trust with stakeholders through transparency and early delivery of value. It’s about being adaptive, receiving feedback, and incrementally enhancing the product.\n\nTraditional project management practices can still be indispensable in providing an initial framework. Still, overemphasising will impair the ability to swiftly navigate the turbulent waters of the market.\n\n> In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable! - Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe [agile philosophy]({{< ref \"/tags/agile-philosophy\" >}}) does not say that documentation or planning is useless. This is a common misconception. It does, however, say that adapting to change is more important than following the plan and, more critically, that working product I more valuable than comprehensive documentation.\n\n**Documentation does not solve a business problem; it merely describes it or a solution for it.**\n\nTo the professional teams, don’t be afraid to embrace Agile’s working products as a lifeline for risk mitigation. Simultaneously, weave in the essential strands of documentation, but with the agility to adapt.\n",

    "BodyContent": "Under the ruthless canopy of the red market, I find myself staring at the bloated behemoth of an Alpha organisation, huffing and puffing in a vain attempt to keep up with the frenzied pace of the modern world. The Alpha model, once a paragon of order and efficiency in the leisurely blue market era, has now morphed into a lumbering dinosaur, with its hierarchical structures and rigid command and control systems looking out of place in the high-speed, unpredictable red markets.\n\n> Alpha Organizations: Born in the Industrial Age, they are hierarchical and less adaptable.\n\n> Blue Markets: Blue markets refer to the historically stable and slow-paced markets rooted in the Industrial Age.\n\nFrom where I stand, I see an excessive trail of waste trailing behind these giants – a by-product of their misguided foray into the red markets. Each wasted opportunity, each missed trend, each delayed product launch, heaps more on the pile of squandered resources. Their attempts to rein in the chaotic, whirlwind pace of red markets with their outmoded command and control policies is like trying to tame a wild river with a teaspoon.\n\nThe bulk of the waste I observe can be traced back to the speed, or rather lack thereof, at which these Alpha organisations operate. Red markets are volatile; they shift and morph at a breathtaking pace. Yet, Alpha organisations move with the grace of a steam train, heavy and cumbersome. The time they waste in bureaucratic decision-making, pushing papers from one department to another, and getting approval from higher-ups who are far removed from the realities of the market is a luxurious indulgence they cannot afford.\n\n> Beta Organizations: Agile and decentralised, they excel in fast-paced markets.\n\n> Red Markets: Red markets are modern, fast-moving, and complex, driven by constant innovation and fluctuating consumer demands.\n\nNot to mention the innovation wasteland they create, full of ideas and ambitions, bright minds find themselves shackled by the Alpha's obsession with command and control. Creativity is stifled; innovation is snuffed out. The organisation considers their ideas too extreme, uncertain, and untested. And so, they are left untapped and unexplored, wasted.\n\nThen there is the waste of human potential. In an Alpha organisation, most power rests with the top tier. The middle and lower rungs are left to follow orders, their insights and expertise largely overlooked. This has created a vast reservoir of untapped potential that has yet to be utilised. So many workers, so much talent, left on the sidelines, their abilities wasted.\n\nFinally, there's the customer disconnect, perhaps the most egregious form of waste. Alpha organisations, ensconced in their ivory towers, struggle to keep their finger on the market’s pulse. They are often slow to respond to changing customer needs, and their offerings often miss the mark, wasting effort, resources, and lost customers.\n\nWatching the Alpha organisation struggle in red markets feels akin to watching a fish attempt to climb a tree. It is a spectacle of monumental waste – a waste of time, resources, talent, and opportunities. However, all is not lost. I see a ray of hope in the form of Beta organisations, nimble and responsive, perfectly suited to thrive in the complex red markets. They are the future; they are the answer. The sooner we realise this, the better we'll be in reducing the colossal waste we are currently witnessing.\n",

    "BodyContent": "As we progress deeper into the dynamic landscape of the 21st century, our long-established organisations, born of the Industrial Age and infused with a DNA of strict command and control, stand on shaky ground. These organisations strut with command-and-control bravado, erecting clear hierarchies in their stable inert markets where bureaucracy reigns supreme. However, they are feeling the tremors of a rapidly evolving, technologically charged dynamic markets and are plagued by sluggish responses and missed opportunities, which are their Achilles heel in these new fast-paced markets. Not since the 1970s has the classic hierarchical model, rooted in the stagnant waters of stable markets, been a viable proposition for companies seeking to thrive in an era of unprecedented change and unpredictability. Clearly, we cannot continue to coat deep-seated hierarchical practices with a thin veneer of modern innovation and expect sustainable transformation.\n\nI see countless individuals trapped in the bureaucratic maze of classic hierarchical organisational structures, their creative potential stifled, their drive for innovation subdued. The belief is that switching to a more modern network model could liberate them from this stifling environment, fuelling both individual and organisational growth.\n\n**Command & control has overcome agility, but it's not a lost cause.**\n\nThere is hope in many new and old organisations moving towards a more market-focused approach based on the Follett's principles of decentralisation and democratisation of the workplace. A world where cross-functional teams dance directly with market demands, while the rest of the organisation provide the necessary services to enable those teams to be nimble and adaptable, they ride the waves of the change markets.\n\nWhile market dynamics have shifted dramatically over the last half-century, the operations of businesses have remained stubbornly static. Businesses yearn for the capacity to flex and adapt in response to the ever-changing market landscape, but this requires more than just minor tweaks to team operations. Most big businesses' current processes, procedures, and practices are finely tuned to maintain the status quo in they were developed in. The need of the hour is for businesses to radically overhaul their organisational architecture to facilitate better alignment with contemporary markets' swift, volatile pace.\n\nAgile was that attempt; sadly, agility has lost the battle against the monolithic paradigm, and the ghosts of hierarchical structures continue to haunt our organisations. The inherent flaws in most organisational transformations lie in their inability to address the root causes of dysfunction, opting instead for the allure of quick fixes and superficial changes. This approach does little more than perpetuate the reign of command and control, allowing it to thwart the advance of agility.\n\nMoreover, the high failure rates associated with [organisational change]({{< ref \"/tags/organisational-change\" >}}) initiatives have desensitised people towards change, leading to widespread apathy and scepticism. Why invest energy in an endeavour doomed to fail?\n\nTracing the historical trajectory of the market landscape, we see the colossal momentum generated by the Industrial Age, characterised by rapidly expanding stable, long running, markets and limited competition. A relative state of stasis governed these markets, creating a safe haven for businesses to grow unopposed with a focus only on productivity and ignorant of effectiveness.\n\nDuring the height of the industrial revolution, Fredrick Winslow Taylor crafted what would become business models tailored to this market reality. Born amidst the emerging markets dominated by textiles, steel and large-scale goods production, this hierarchical model thrived in the predictable, slow-changing, or 'Inert', markets.\n\nAs the 20th century dawned, competition intensified, and product diversity increased, nudging markets from the predictability of stagnant towards the dynamic, complex, and volatile nature that they have today. This shift gained momentum in the 1940s with the advent of television and software, spreading ideas at a breakneck pace.\n\nThe advent of the microprocessor in the 1970s and the euphoria surrounding the moon landings pushed the economy into overdrive. These events marked the transition of almost all markets to the complex dynamic, and the classic organisations, unable to cope with the speed of change demanded by these markets, began to falter.\n\nThis transformation, however, went largely unnoticed, and many businesses, although effectively obsolete, continued to lumber forward, propelled by financial reserves, customer goodwill, or sheer scale. Vast amounts of waste encumbered them, and if these organisations fail to breathe life into their moribund structures, they will indeed stumble and fall, though it may take them many years to do so.  \nMoreover, I've noticed a tendency for businesses that initially abandon hierarchical practices to slip back into old habits as they grow. An even more profound realisation is that all start-ups are dynamic network organisations. However, these businesses gradually transformed into monolithic organisations characterised by hierarchies, departments, and command-and-control dynamics without regular hygiene or refactoring.\n\n**They build up organisational cruft.**\n\nEnter the network organisations, born out of Mary Parker Follett's revolutionary concept of a decentralised organisational structure. Leveraging her social work experience and fascination with organisational dynamics, Follett centred her approach on social organisation.  \nEvery hierarchical organisation has an underlying network-based organisational structure, a network of communication and collaboration that drives success without relying on the steering and escalation mechanisms that the hierarchical model so heavily depends on.\n\nDespite the rise of numerous attempts to create more dynamic organisations – from the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to the Spotify Model – many of these initiatives merely layer more control mechanisms atop the existing hierarchical model and already excessive bureaucracy.\n\nThe time has come for a resurgence, a renewed drive towards the modern network organisational model. Agility's dream of a decentralised, democratic, low-atrophy organisation that can swiftly adapt to market changes is not an impossibility. To make this dream a reality, we must shift away from classic models and move towards modern ones. However, we continually allow the classic to persist.\n\nAs agile practitioners, we've enabled this complacency by making organisations believe that only minor changes are necessary. We must challenge these misconceptions, actively promote modern models and practices, and stop accepting that organisational change will take years.\n\nWith concepts such as OpenSpace Agile and OpenSpace Modern, we can transform from the traditional, rigid classic model to the modern, adaptive model that can truly thrive in the face of complex, modern markets within only a few months.\n\nThen, with the continued application of constant refactoring and organisational hygiene, we can maintain an agile, modern organisation at scale that can continuously adapt to the changing needs of whatever the market throws at it.\n\n**References:**\n\nHere is a list of the books, blogs, and content that may have influenced my ideas and positions for this post:\n\n- [Organize for Complexity: How to Get Life Back Into Work to Build the High-Performance Organization by Niels Pflaeging and Pia Steinmann](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21807644-organize-for-complexity)\n\n- [Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness by Frédéric Laloux and Ken Wilber](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20787425-reinventing-organizations)\n\n- [This Is Beyond Budgeting: A Guide to More Adaptive and Human Organizations by Bjarte Bogsnes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61815997-this-is-beyond-budgeting)\n\n- [OpenSpace Beta](https://www.redforty2.com/openspacebeta)\n\n- [BetaCodex Network - Learn about the Alternative to Management!](https://betacodex.org/home)\n",

    "BodyContent": "Business Leaders face a key challenge when [scaling]({{< ref \"/tags/scaling\" >}}) their organisations effectively while maintaining the distinctiveness that made us successful in the first place. Many frameworks and methodologies, such as Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or the Spotify Model, promise a structured approach to scaling, but do they genuinely fit our unique needs? In this post, I aim to highlight the importance of creating our own scaling practices, highlighting that successful commercial software organizations have thrived by embracing their distinctiveness rather than adopting standardized approaches.\n\nUnique DNA of Success: Every successful organisation has its DNA, a unique combination of values, culture, and practices contributing to its achievements. These characteristics differentiate us from our competitors and have played a significant role in our success thus far. Implementing someone else's scaling practices, like SAFe or the Spotify Model, may seem tempting, but it risks diluting our distinctive DNA and eroding the competitive edge we've worked so hard to build.\n\nTailored Solutions for Our Context: No two organizations are exactly alike, and attempting to fit our complex and dynamic business into a one-size-fits-all framework can lead to disaster. Commercial software organisations that have achieved remarkable success have done so by tailoring their practices to their unique context. Instead of blindly adopting pre-established scaling methodologies, we must focus on understanding our specific challenges, opportunities, and strengths. By creating our own scaling practices, we can ensure they align perfectly with our business objectives, culture, and customer needs.\n\nAgility and Adaptability: Agile organisations thrive on adaptability, [continuous improvement]({{< ref \"/tags/continuous-improvement\" >}}), and embracing change. When we create our own scaling practices, we foster an environment of agility that allows us to respond swiftly and effectively to evolving market dynamics. By avoiding rigid frameworks, we retain the freedom to experiment, innovate, and iterate our practices as needed. This adaptability empowers our teams to optimise processes, improve collaboration, and deliver customer value more efficiently.\n\nLearning from the Best: While it's true that no successful commercial software organizations have fully adopted SAFe or the Spotify Model, it doesn't mean we should ignore all external insights. We can learn from their experiences, successes, and failures, extracting valuable lessons that can inform our own scaling journey. By incorporating the best elements from various sources, we can create a hybrid approach that integrates external learning with our internal expertise, further enhancing our chances of success.\n\nNurturing a Culture of Ownership: Creating our own scaling practices encourages ownership and engagement from our teams. When employees are involved in shaping the processes that will drive our growth, they become invested in the outcomes. This sense of ownership fosters a culture of accountability, innovation, and [continuous learning]({{< ref \"/tags/continuous-learning\" >}}), leading to higher levels of motivation and performance. Empowered teams, driven by a shared purpose and supported by tailored practices, are more likely to achieve exceptional results.\n\nIn the fast-paced and ever-evolving business landscape, scaling our organisation is critical. While adopting pre-established frameworks and methodologies may be tempting, it is vital to recognise the value of creating our own scaling practices that emerge over time. By preserving our unique DNA, tailoring solutions to our context, fostering agility, learning from others, and nurturing a culture of ownership, we position ourselves for sustainable success.\n\nLet's embrace our distinctiveness, leverage our strengths, and carve our own path towards scaling greatness.\n",
