Microsoft Test Manager (MTM), AKA Test Professional, is a new testing system that team can use to create manual and Automation test quickly.

1. Explain the architecture of MTM
2. Setup a Manual test run
3. Show how to configure the environment, build and other conditions for a test
4. How MTM is completely integrated into TFS and VS 2010
5. How we can gather real-time test data that we can provide back to teams or person
