In fact, I managed to put my server completely out of action and I have been trying to fix it off and on for a couple of weeks (I have been on holiday). This being my only day in for the rest of this year, I thought I should give it another go, as I did not want the server down for another week...\n\nWell, I found a little called [kb841216](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841216/en-us) that describes the problem:\n\n> \"0x80040E14\" or \"HTTP 500\" error message when you connect to your Windows SharePoint Services Web site after you install a Windows SharePoint Services service pack or a security update\n\nThe reason I get the errors is that the content databases are not at the same version as the application files causing an inability for SharePoint to read the database. You can solve this by running a nice little stsadm command:\n\n> cd /d %commonprogramfiles%Microsoft SharedWeb Server Extensions60Bin\n>\n> stsadm -o upgrade -forceupgrade\n\nThis may not fix your problems, but it sure fixed mine....\n\nNow to get the [Virus Protection problems](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/no-love-between-mcafee-enterprise-and-moss-2007.aspx) solved....\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

With a little luck and some saved holidays I will not be back in the office until the 3rd January 2008 :) I will be in the office for damage control on the 31st, but apart from that I am a free man...\n\nWell, I have been looking after my daughter and playing my [XBOX](http://www.360voice.com/blog.asp?tag=hinshelm \"hinshelm's Xbox 360 Blog\") and generally [faffing](http://www.elfyourself.com/?id=1466005756 \"I got Elfed!\") around with a lot of miscellaneous Christmas stuff online. I have still not got my [Sharepoint 2007 development box working](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx) after the [Service Pack 1 / McAfee](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/no-love-between-mcafee-enterprise-and-moss-2007.aspx) fandangle, but I am hopping that I can get it done at some point this week, if for nothing else but piece of mind...\n\nI am keeping up with my feed reading, an I came across an [article](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/features/article.aspx?editorialsid=1788) on the Visual Studio Magazine site that highlights the little known uses of WPF. The author (Kathleen Dollard) highlights the things that I thought WPF was for anyway (but largely ignored) and its benefits over WinForms. I think that Kathleen has hit the nail right on the head that WPF will be the way foreword for future .NET application development, but it does have a steep learning curve and it is different from the way that we have built applications in the past. I have resigned myself to learn this black art of WPF and increase my skill set with this worthwhile weapon in my arsenal.\n\nI can only hope that Kathleen Dollard and other experts provide the same level and topics of articles, and like Kathleen said, Microsoft should also push its developers to show off WPF in this way.[![](images/hinshelm-2-2.png)](http://profile.mygamercard.net/hinshelm)\n{ .post-img }\n\nSo its WPF for me this holiday...\n\nI will leave you with the \"[Hinshelwood family Christmas elf's](http://www.elfyourself.com/?id=1466005756 \"Hinshelwood family christmass elfs\")\" or \"[me as scrooge](http://www.scroogeyourself.com/?id=1538113679)\" if you are on the other Christmas spirit :)\n\nP.S.

This is more than coincidence and I have requested that our infrastructure team remove McAfee from all SharePoint servers so we don't have this kind of problem in the future.\n\nNow, McAfee say that they support SharePoint Services 3.0, but MOSS has a bunch of extra features (Enterprise Search being one) that are not around in WSS. It seams that there are specific versions of Anti-Virus products for SharePoint Portal Servers and for good reason...\n\nHopefully I can get this sorted soon.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

I will try a reboot and see if there are any pending updates or just general trash interfering. If you have ever had to read a SharePoint install log, you will know that they are next to useless.

At the moment it just does not connect at all to my laptop at home, which is just as well as I would end up with a multitude of duplicate contacts ever time I sync between two mobile. And not just my contacts, at some points I have had my phone go off at midnight (when I am sleeping) with five or six birthday alerts for the same person!\n\n[ActiveSync](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/activesync/default.mspx) has many of the same problems...\n\n## Interim Solutions\n\nI even went through a phase of installing [Exchange 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server) and [Active Directory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory) on my server just to use [Exchange ActiveSync](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998357.aspx)...Which is cool, and useful.. But not really worth the overhead of managing it at home.\n\n[![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_2-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI wanted to go further and have my contacts update their own information. So I started using [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood) as a contact repository, and using the [LinkedIn Outlook toolbar](http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=outlook_toolbar_download&trk=ftr_otb) I had a lot of success. I have used [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood) for this purpose for a couple of years now, but I am now finding that I have a multitude of these collaboration sites under my belt, and I really need a tool that sync's with all my online tools and my offline ones.\n\n## A better way\n\n[![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_2.png) And so this leads me to [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com). This is by far and away the best tool I have come across. It's so good, I even paid the subscription fee to get the extra features like Mobile Sync, contact backup and others. _And you know that is not like me :)_\n{ .post-img }\n\n[Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com) has this marvelous tool called the \"De-duper\". Can you imagine what it does :). And I will tell you something, I went from 1250 ish contacts to 920 without even breaking a sweat...\n\nThere are many more Syncing options available, although some are only for paid up members...\n\nAnd what does [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com) do for me...\n\n### **Contacts**\n\n[![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_5-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_12.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nPlaxo provides a single point of truth for all my contacts. I can have an email sent to any of my contacts to get them to update their details, and they do not even need to be members of Plaxo to do this :).\n\n- Sync's my Contacts from Outlook at work\n- Sync's my Contacts from Outlook at home\n- Sync's my contacts from my phone\n- Sync's my contacts from LinkedIn (One Way)\n- Sync's my contacts from Google\n\nI get a very nice little profile ([http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com)) that I can control how and who can view my information.\n\n### Calendar\n\n[![image](images/InformationSync_1CD-image_thumb_6-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InformationSync_1CD-image_14.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have two calendars setup on Plaxo that overlay. One for my personal and one for my Office calendar items. Both calendars applier in both my Outlook's and as I am using 2007 I can overlay them if I want to.\n\n- Sync's my Calendar from Outlook at work\n- Sync's my Calendar from Outlook at home\n- Sync's my Calendar from my phone\n- Sync's my Calendar from Google (One Way) \\[hopefully not for long\\]\n\nMy calendars are published in two formats: one that has a friendly URL ([http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com/calendar](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com/calendar)) that is publicly available as a free busy publication and one that has a crazy URL that has my actual meeting subjects in them for private access.\n\nAll of my calendars are synced to my phone \"over the air\" in a consolidated view...\n\n## The future\n\nThere are a number of features I would like to see in Plaxo as, although they are in beta testing of version 3 of their website (the one I am using) there are a couple of niggly things that mildly irritate me. Though I am impressed with the number and functionality of the syncs that are available. Many more than I use...\n\n- The ability to see the last time contacts details were updated by me, and by them (even if they are not members of Plaxo)...Maybe an option to request an update from all contacts that have not updated details in 1 year.\n- No notification on my windows mobile for PlaxoSync when it fails to connect unless I manually initiated a Sync.\n- The ability to choose when adding an event which calendar it goes into from my phone...Currently I am not sure what will happen...\n- The ability to control the viability of individual fields of information on my profiles...mainly to control what is displayed on my [http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com](http://martinhinshelwood.myplaxo.com) page.\n- Adding the ability to sync RSS feed lists with Outlook, IE, Google and others....\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [WM6](http://technorati.com/tags/WM6)\n",

It is a bit of a pain in Flash as the system resources required for flash these days seams a little excessive, but I would like to see it running as a WPF XBAP.\n\nIn fact I would go as far as to say, that would be something my company would pay money for. You see we have generators in service and at depots all over the world. that is our Fleet if you will, and our board members would eat up this kind of thing. If we could pass it some geographical data and plot all of our generators and coolers around the world in real time it would be a fantastic data presentation tool for the board.\n\nI think that the globe above , while cool, is a wee bit to gimmicky for that purpose, but the [NeoEarth](http://www.neoworx.net/blue/neoearth_page.php) feature would better suit our needs...\n\nAll it needs is for [NeoWORX](http://www.neoworx.net/) to provide some sort of SDK with a local install of the engine for corporate customers to send their application any Geo tagged data :) With, hopefully, the ability to control what appears in the popup's :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I am having a look at Microsoft's [Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) as a solution to our disparate user identity problem. Some of the bigger companies out there have solved this problem, and in many of the smaller companies it just does not exist, but we have many system that hold meta data about our employees. From HR systems to Active Directory and custom web based address books. Because of Aggreko's unprecedented growth these systems have outgrown our capacity to maintain the consistency of the data, with small groups responsible for each repository and everyone not knowing where ALL the repository's are or who controls them.\n\nThe idea of [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) server is to provide a single \"metaverse\" where all of the data is stored that has agents and adapters for all of the systems that you have. These agents and adapters are responsible for pulling and pushing the data between the stores in a consistent manor, so if HR in France updates a users job title it gets pulled into the \"metaverse\" and then pushed out to all of other system connected to [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx).\n\n> #### **How Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007 Works**\n>\n> [![](images/48505_375x262_miis_f.jpg)](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/overview.mspx)\n> { .post-img }\n\nOut of the box ILM 2007 [supports](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/overview.mspx) the following agents and connectors:\n\n> **_Network Operating Systems and Directory Services_**\n>\n> _Microsoft Active Directory Windows Server 2003 R2, 2003, and 2000  \n> Microsoft Active Directory Application Mode Windows Server 2003 R2 and 2003  \n> Microsoft Windows NT 4.0  \n> IBM Tivoli Directory Server  \n> Novell eDirectory 8.6.2, 8.7, and 8.7.x  \n> Sun Directory Server (Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE) 4.x and 5.x_\n>\n> **_Mainframe_**\n>\n> _IBM Resource Access Control Facility  \n> Computer Associates eTrust ACF2  \n> Computer Associates eTrust Top Secret_\n>\n> **_Email and Messaging_**\n>\n> _Microsoft Exchange 2007, 2003, 2000, and 5.5  \n> Lotus Notes 6.x, 5.0, and 4.6_\n>\n> **_Applications_**\n>\n> _SAP 5.0 and 4.7  \n> Telephone switches  \n> XML-based systems  \n> DSML-based systems_\n>\n> **_Databases_**\n>\n> _Microsoft SQL Server 2005, 2000, and 7  \n> IBM DB2  \n> Oracle 10g, 9i, and 8i_\n>\n> **_File-Based_**\n>\n> _Attribute value Pairs  \n> CSV  \n> Delimited  \n> Fixed Width  \n> Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) 2.0  \n> LDAP Interchange Format (LDIF)_\n>\n> **_All Other_**\n>\n> _Extensible Management Agent for connectivity to all other systems_\n\nBut [ILM](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/ilm2007/default.mspx) supports way more than just data consistency. It will even provision Active Directory accounts and mail accounts automatically if an employee is added by HR enabling this process to be automated. You could have HR create a user in their system and set the relevant \"profile\" that the relates to the user and have their AD and mail setup along with permissions for SharePoint sites, folder shares and any other custom system you care to name ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif) I like this system already... even if it only does half of what it says on the box it could be a very effective tool in the arsenal of any companies automation strategies.\n{ .post-img }\n\nA good point to note is wither the Data protection Act covers information about a person stored by the company they work for! I am not sure wither the same rules apply, but it is of benefit to any company if users details are accurate across all of their systems.\n\nThe [benefits](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/idm/default.mspx) according to Microsoft's\n\npropaganda marketing:\n\n> - _**Improve Operational Efficiency**  \n>    Now businesses can aggregate identities across the enterprise into a single view, simplify user access to multiple applications, reduce IT costs, and increase productivity._\n> - _**Boost Compliance**  \n>    Companies can ensure that every user has proper access to resources, create auditable processes for access rights, and deploy single sign-on capabilities that comply with company policy._\n> - _**Heighten Security**  \n>    Businesses can reduce the risk of security leaks by ensuring that only authorized users can gain access to company resources and that people know who they are dealing with electronically._\n> - _**Enable Business Success**  \n>    By securely sharing identities across organizational boundaries, businesses can collaborate more efficiently with partners and customers._\n\nWe will see! I am currently installing a dev box and I will evaluate it according to the specific needs of our business...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Misc](http://technorati.com/tags/Misc)\n",

The photos of the kids, your correspondence, all your work... You need backup...\n\nI have been looking for a solution that does not brake the bank, but the best I could find was \"BT\" who charge and arm and a leg while probably losing your data. If the government can lose 7 million peoples personal details (du..post? How dumb can you get!) then BT can lose your backup. With Mozy being a smaller company, all be it partnered with someone bigger, loosing your data could brake them, so it is in their interest to provide the best service rather than best-effort as you would get from BT or another monolithic company that really does not care about your data, just your money...\n\n[![image](images/MozyBackup_10C2F-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI have only just started using [Mozy Backup](https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) but I think it is a winner. With 2GB of free space (which never does the job :)) it is a fantastic solution. And it is only $5 for unlimited space, Wow...\n\nIt has a really simple setup, even my dad could work it, and just chugs away in the background. You get options (pictured above) for wither you want quicker backups or a faster computer, but with 2.5GB of data to get through I opted for the faster backup.\n\nAnd speaking of data size, did you notice that I don't have enough space for a full backup? Well if you sign up using this URL [https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG](https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) you get an extra 250mb, and so do I :)\n\n[![image](images/MozyBackup_10C2F-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nOnly 11 hours to go till I have a full backup :)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal)\n",

Although I eagerly signed up for it, I did not expect to learn a lot:\n\n**Windows SharePoint 3.0** - [Martin Parry](http://www.martinparry.com/)\n\nI am not usually a fan of Martin's speaking, but it seems that it might have been due to the content that I have heard him present in the past. maybe he just always got the short straw for the boring content at previous events I have attended, but this time I was presently surprised.\n\nI found Martin's incite into SharePoint Services 2007 very informative and interesting and I learned the following key points about WSS3.0 that interested me:\n\n- Office SharePoint Designer is for users\n\n> _Although SharePoint designer is the \"new\" front page, it is definitely for \"power\" users of SharePoint. Its ability to make simple Workflow easy and to allow the user more control over many facets of the sites and lists is invaluable. Granted this is not the tool for all users. Most users are content to point and click within SharePoint itself, but when that is not enough (and when you need a new type of workflow it is not), this is the tool that they will turn to. It works very like all of the office products with a friendly users interface and a default tendency to hide the code that may frighten a less experienced power user._\n\n- Not for relational things!\n\n> _Martin pointed out that this is a mistake that many developers get into with SharePoint, and being one of those unfortunate developers who has tried to struggle with relational content, I agree with him that SharePoint does not handle it well. This is not a bad thing, just a limitation to be aware of. I have spent many hours trying to get a list in Site A to load content from another list in Site B, which is just not the way to do it..._\n\n- SharePoint workflow with VS2008\n\n> _The new SharePoint 2007 Workflow projects within Visual Studio 2008 look very impressive and beats the previous method in VS2005 hands down. You can find the new projects under the \"Office\" section of your chosen language in VS2008._\n>\n> [_![image](images/EventMSDNSharePointforDevelopers_F0A9-image_thumb-1-1.png)_](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-EventMSDNSharePointforDevelopers_F0A9-image_2.png)\n> { .post-img }\n\n**An introduction to MOSS 2007** - [David Gristwood](http://blogs.msdn.com/david_gristwood/)\n\nThis was the first time I had seen David perform on stage and I was quite impressed. He initially seams agitated, as he hops about on stage, but as the session unfolded it becomes just part of his presentation style. He gets very exited about the subjects he is talking about and can make even boring subjects seam interesting. Here are the cool things I found interesting:\n\n- Enterprise search is very cool\n\n> _This is something that I knew already, but it was good to see a demo implementation and even a quick look at Microsoft's own internal implementation of Search within an organisation._\n\n- Search can search exchange and custom databases (BDC)\n\n> _The ability to integrate BDC information into your search results, I think is invaluable. You could give users the ability to look up Customers or in our case Fleet units or products and link them all together. Very powerfully..._\n\n- Use info path for forms\n\n> _I had not really seen any info path implementation prior to this presentation, but I had played about with it and noted the lack of customisation and lack of direct integration inside of SharePoint. What David showed us however convinced me that if users need to fill out a form, it should be done in info path. It is a fantastic tool to add to the arsenal of SharePoint._\n\nI found the whole thing very informative and I would recommend it to both novices and experts as it helped me fill in some of the blanks and gain incite into future improvements.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

Eventually giving you a 401 error.\n\nI consulted with one of Aggreko's Infrastructure Team guys, Gary Hay (no blog! Gary...Get a blog) , who when I pointed out the problem said, in way more polite terms, \"WTF\"!\n\nAfter a surprisingly short time, he sent me a link and told me it was fixed: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861 \"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861\")\n\n> _This issue occurs if you install Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1). Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 include a loopback check security feature that is designed to help prevent reflection attacks on your computer. Therefore, authentication fails if the FQDN or the custom host header that you use does not match the local computer name._\n\nFirst, why would you want your server called the same as your website, and second, why would you NOT be hosting multiple sites under multiple host headers on the same server. I can only think of a couple of servers I have setup that have only one site, and it is NEVER called the same thing as the server...\n\nAfter some testing I found that it was indeed fixed. Now, I had this exact same problem at Merrill Lynch and even with their hundreds, if not thousands of technical folk, no one could solve the problem. Just goes to show...just coz you are big and have masses of people, does not mean you have the right people...\n\n![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-1-1.gif) Thanks Gary...\n{ .post-img }\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

    "BodyContent": "Well, setting up TFS 2008 is pretty easy. I have done an upgrade before, but I have now deployed my first pure TFS 2008 server to a clean environment. I have Reporting Services, SQL and TFS on one box and SharePoint 2007 in my Farm. Word of warning:\n\n> **_RTFM_**\n\nThe first thing I did after a successfully install of TFS was make sure that I could create my first project \"Test 1\". This is essential to determine that everything is working and should be done on the server to prevent any other issues getting in the way.\n\n[![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_2.png) \n{ .post-img }\n\nThe only problem I had was getting the reporting working. The first issue was authentication. When I checked the \"Default Website\" config it was set to anonymous only, so I changed that to \"Integrated Windows\" and that solved the authentication issues.\n\n[![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe second problem was that I changed the reporting server URL, again to the friendly one and it broke SharePoint. I have a SharePoint 2007 Farm where all the TFS portals will be deployed. Even though I ran \"TfsConfigWss.exe\" located in the Tools folder on the SharePoint server after installing the SharePoint TFS component I still needed to run a register hack to get it to work. The key is under the Local Machine @SoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio9.0TeamFoundationReportServer and you get a key for each of your SharePoint managed paths.\n\n[![image](images/InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTFS2008fromscratch_C7F-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWhat TFS does now does that is very nice is that you can have multiple TFS servers deploying to the same SharePoint farm. So I created a Managed Path of \"TFS01\" (my first TFS server at Aggreko, Awww) and pointed TFS at it.\n\nI then changed the name of the server to a friendly name. This is no longer the [nasty mess it once was](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/31/Team-Foundation-Server-amp-SharePoint-3.0.aspx): The TfsAdminUtil.exe now has functionality to change all of the URLs for TFS, SharePoint and RS, so that was easy.\n\nBut I still have the old issue of not being able to authenticate when I am on the server once I have changed the \"name\" of TFS from the server name (default) to a friendly URL.\n\nThis is no problem as that was how it worked in my previous environment. I think it is a proxy server issue, but I am not sure. Not much of a problem though...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2008)\n",

My boss came to me a couple of days ago and asked for a Work Item Tracking system in SharePoint 2007. I did my best, but as the requirements got more complicated and the metrics that they wanted to report on exploded, I said that TFS was the answer...\n\nThis is not just a deployment of TFS for the purposes of tracking development projects. Nor is it only to be used for non-IT projects, but across the board of our companies project management. If I can prove that it will work :)\n\nSome of the features that they have hinted at I know will not be there until Rosario is available, and other features will require some amount of customization, especially some of the fleet utilization capabilities we want to build in among other things.\n\nIn the short term we want to use as many of the out of the box functionality as possible, but major customizations are on the way... I will need to resurrect my [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) for some of the things we have been discussing and implement the Windows Workflow functionality that I threatened to do before.\n\nOn that note, and to bring SharePoint 2007 properly into the mix...has anyone setup any Business Data Catalog stuff that points to SharePoint?

Information should include:\n\n- Where the server is\n- What operating system it is running\n- wither it is an application or database server (or a virtual hosting environment server)\n- What the application or system it is running\n- the environment it is for\n\nThis is a tall order, and I have worked many places that have server names like \"glasgow1\", \"glasgow2\", \"exchange\" or \"fileserver\". I even went through a phase of naming servers \"Titan\" or \"Colossus\". This is fine if you have at most 5 servers, but once you get to the data center or multiple data center level you need something more meaningfully.\n\nAll this was knocked out of me when I started working for Merrill Lynch. They have thousands of servers and applications and systems that consist of 70-80 servers at a time and you need to be able to identify servers on your network more easily.\n\nI grew to like Merrill's naming convention which is:\n\n> _\\[where\\]\\[virtual?\\]\\[OS\\]\\[Application|database\\]\\[system\\]\\[environment\\]\\[identifier\\]_\n\nIf you had a server in London that runs on a virtual host with a Microsoft operating system that is an application server for SharePoint in the development environment, and it is the first server you would get \\[elon\\]\\[v\\]\\[m\\]\\[ap\\]\\[sp\\]\\[d\\]\\[01\\] (elonvmapspd01).\n\nLets look at an example where you have 2 web servers, 1 application server and 1 SQL server for your SharePoint production deployment:\n\n> _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_\n\nNow add your development, Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing environments:\n\n> _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14_\n\nNow, in the intervening time, the company adds a TFS server development environment for testing:\n\n> _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14_, Glasgow15, Glasgow16\n\nDo you see the problem. If you now want to add another web server to your production SharePoint it would be \"Glasgow17\". Oh, and we need to add our TFS UAT environment, and lets not forget a SharePoint disaster recovery environment.\n\n> _Glasgow1, Glasgow2, Glasgow3, Glasgow4_, _Glasgow5, Glasgow6, Glasgow7, Glasgow8_, _Glasgow9, Glasgow10, Glasgow11, Glasgow12_, _Glasgow13, Glasgow14, Glasgow15, Glasgow16, Glasgow17, Glasgow18, Glasgow19, Glasgow20, Glasgow21, Glasgow22, Glasgow23, Glasgow24, Glasgow25_\n\n**Do you remember which server is which?

It seams obvious to me that you would want to show your Work Items in SharePoint and integrate SharePoint Workflow into Team Foundation Server. It only make sense to be able to initially create a SharePoint Work item that is a request from a user into SharePoint, have some sort of approval workflow before assigning it to a project within [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\").\n\nI think that [Mike Glaser](http://bloggingabout.net/members/Mike-Glaser.aspx)'s blog [post](http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx) on _\"_[_How about one Team Foundation Server portal? I had a dream!_](http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx)_\"_ hits the nail exactly on the head. Why can we not view our bugs in SharePoint and create Change requests there?\n\nWhat would be excellent would be Mike's hierarchical project space. You should be able to create work items at the root level and then assign them to projects on the way down. This way, user, who have no idea what project a Change Request is for  can create them in the central pool, and then the project manager or technical experts can filter them down into the actual project that the change is for.\n\nAs a start, instead of releasing \"Web access for Team Foundation Server\" as a power tool, it should have been re-engineered into a set of web parts that can be integrated into SharePoint. That way we could have used the default site, or created our own custom components.\n\nMicrosoft, if you are listening to either Mike or myself...please do not forget the Workflow integration too....\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I recently received a job spec that had the most ridiculous \"Required\" skill set for an \"Analyst Programmer\". I though I should share it with you as I have just spent the last 10 minutes cleaning tea out of my keyboard with cotton bud's. Here is how it was presented in the email:\n\n> _\\* C# Java Script Java  \n> \\* ASP.NET 1.1 ASP.NET 2.0 J2EE  \n> \\* Visual Studio 2003 SOA Visual Basic  \n> \\* Winforms Development Visual Studio 2005 Linux  \n> \\* SQL Server 2000 (TSQL and Database Design) AJAX Data Cleansing  \n> \\* Full Life-Cycle SQL Server 2005 SMS  \n> \\* Object Oriented Design Multi-channel CRM IVR  \n> \\* Strong verbal and written communication skills Call Centre UML  \n> \\* Organisational and problem solving capabilities ISO9000_\n\nNow obviously this list was formulated by someone who has no idea what these things are, so lets brake that up into a proper list...\n\n**Skills Required:**\n\n- C#\n- Java Script\n- Java\n- ASP.NET 1.1\n- ASP.NET 2.0\n- J2EE\n- Visual Studio 2003\n- SOA\n- Visual Basic\n- Winforms Development\n- Visual Studio 2005\n- Linux\n- SQL Server 2000\n- TSQL\n- Database Design\n- AJAX\n- Data Cleansing\n- Full Life-Cycle\n- SQL Server 2005\n- SMS\n- Object Oriented Design\n- Multi-channel CRM\n- IVR\n- Call Centre\n- UML\n- ISO9000\n\nI can't imagine anyone actually knowing how to do all of these things. If they do, they would only have a cursory knowledge of  each think and be useless at programming any one of these. I could understand this for a Architect or Evangelist role where depth of knowledge is not required. But for a programmer there is a necessity to concentrate on one technology at a time, and only with 2-3 years commercial experience would you be considered \"good\" at it.\n\nWhoever this employer is needs to come to the realisation that this is about 5 (or more) roles all mashed together:\n\n- Architect\n- .NET Developer\n- Java Developer\n- Web Developer\n- SQL Developer\n\nIf I am wrong, please let me know! And if you are one of these \"Uber-Analyst Developers\" then...well, I don't believe for a moment that you could actually do all of these things well...\n\n**Advice for an employer:** If you are an employer, only define a list of the absolute essential skills. If you find someone good enough at those, then they can learn the bits and bobs that go with the others.\n\n**Advice for a job seeker:** If you are a prospective employee, don't lie and say that you know all of these things (I have interviewed my fare share of people who did), but instead say that you know a set of core things, and that you can learn the rest...\n\n**Advice for everyone:** I am not saying that it is the holy grail or anything, but read [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), many of his articles are just common sense, but other are down right genius (and, no, I am not looking for a job at [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com) ;).\n\nEspecially:\n\n> - [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html)\n> - [A Field Guide to Developers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html)\n> - [Finding Great Developers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FindingGreatDevelopers.html)\n> - [Writing a programmer job description](http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=24706)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

Don't get me wrong it is a vast improvement over SharePoint 2003 and I have already built 2 Features (but not for public consumption yet).\n\nSharePoint 2007 uses a combination of CSS and master pages to allow the developer to make most of the changes that are required for branding, but it is still just so hard... I am no CSS or html expert so I am relearning skills I have not really used for about 4 years. The last web project I worked on I had the luxury and the privilege to work again with my friend Greg Fyans, who is the BEST CSS, Accessibility and HTML guru I have ever seen.\n\nSharePoint is predominantly built using tables. Why, I don't know, in this world of CSS, but it is.\n\nMSDN has a three part article on \"[Customizing and Branding Web Content Management-Enabled SharePoint Sites](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa830818.aspx)\" which is very informative, but which still lacks lead through. By that I mean that you select and load brands that already exist on the server and only add a single (ish) line of HTML to show how to customize it. This is not quite enough for me, but the articles are very usefully anyway.\n\nXFN:\n\nP.S. Although Greg Fyans CSS and HTML skills are beyond guru(Savant I think) his DotNetNuke skills are still being honed: I look forward to seeing his site up again.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007)\n",

So for now, I will be trying to focus more on Sharepoint 2007 / MOSS and the feature deficient Sharepoint 2003.\n\nMy new job entails maintaining a heavily customized Sharepoint 2003 deployment and some other nick knacks, while deploying MOSS for the company I am now with. I am quickly expanding my knowledge of Sharepoint from that additional bit bolted onto Team Foundation Server to a more rounded look at its enterprise deployment and integration with other systems.\n\nI will need to migrate and integrate a number of other applications into MOSS including:\n\n- Sharepoint Server Portal\n- over 500 team sites in Sharepoint 2003 (Created over time, with no structure...Oh my!)\n- a BI Portal built on Reporting Services and Crystal Reports\n- an extensive intranet that incorporates many Sharepoint like features and an extensive custom workflow system\n- an HR Administration function site\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but those applications that I have either found or been made aware of, and it does not by any measure include the future work already being talked about within the company on workflow and automation.\n\nAt least I have some help, a nice guy from New Iberia (Hi Michael!) and a Gal from Chicago who are both currently snowed under with the current work on the systems.\n\nThis should be fun...\n\n![](images/smile.gif)\n{ .post-img }\n{ .post-img }\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [MOSS](http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

Its just a pity that I can't install it. Why do Microsoft insist on writing these bundle application for installing many products at once? I can see the point for home users, but at work you always get something blocked. They should provide the choice of using the bulk installer or using a direct download link. This would allow companies to unblock a specific URL without allowing users to download and install one of the other, **banned**, applications.\n\nAs it is, if even one of the applications in the installer is _**banned**_, then they have to block the whole thing. This is what has happened in my company with \\_\"WLInstaller.exe\", b_ecause it installs Messenger. This punishes the rest of us who want to use one of the other pieces of software...\n\nAs it is, I had to install [Windows Live Writer Beta 2](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1272.entry), from a direct link:\n\n[http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/e/c/1ecbf3be-298b-467c-84d8-6f86f01478d7/en-us/Install_WLWriter.exe)\n\nIt took me about a week, after getting authorization, to get my download capability un-restricted in SurfControl. The Infrastructure team spent a while going back a fourth testing changes to get it working, all the while saying \"_It must be IE7!_\" or, \"_Do you have Office 2007, ah, that's why! If you uninstall it it will work!_\" and other assorted rubbish.\n\nWhat did it boiler down to? What did they have to do to get it working? Was it permissions? No! Was it IE7? No! Was it Office 2007?

    "BodyContent": "Back in March I [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/03/03/Deep_vein_thrombosis_DVT.aspx) about my friend Katie McPherson that died of DVT and her family's [petition](http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=155) calling for the Scottish Executive to [introduce mandatory assessment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7024788.stm) tools for all health boards for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and to get all newborn babies tested for the \"Factor V\" gene that increases their susceptibility to the condition.\n\nI would like to share this email from my good friend Steven McPherson...\n\n> Subject: Update on epetition for my sister\n>\n> _Hi all,_\n>\n> _Just a wee update on the above. Hope you will remember earlier this year you and many others very kindly signed the epetition for changes to the management and protocols for DVT as a result of the death of Katie._\n>\n> _My parents were at the Scottish Parliament today (which they say is a truly horrendous building) to meet with the epetitions panel to discuss this petition further which I am pleased to say went very well._\n>\n> _They were met there by newspapers and a TV crew, before and after they went into the parliament and the news clip can be found here_ [_http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002_](http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002)_. If you wish to see the full 35mins of their presentation within the parliament drop me a line and I can forward this onto you. I am told it will appear on_ [_www.holyrood.tv/_](http://www.holyrood.tv/) _tomorrow under the archive section, although I have a copy of it if this is not the case. Both my parents did very well within the parliament making their points very clear and answering all the panels questions in great detail._\n>\n> _I am aware from my good friend Martin there were also stories on the radio and teletext (of all places) today, covering this. My parents were interviewed by a number of press after the session, so no doubt this will appear in further papers/TV/radio etc tomorrow and over the remaining week._\n>\n> _It appears that at long last we are beginning to make some head way. I believe the next stage is for the epetitions panel to look into the existing guidelines / protocols to establish the current situation and then look into how things can be changed for the future._\n>\n> _I'm sure you don't need reminding but Katie would have been 28yrs old this Sunday._\n>\n> _Main point of this email is to once again thank you for your support. In the end we managed to get 143 signatures for the epetition which is fantastic and would not have been possible without all your support._\n>\n> _Many thanks and look forward to seeing you soon._\n>\n> _Steven McPherson_\n\nThe family have a Website \"[http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/](http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/ \"http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/\")\"  where they link to many news stories on the subject and a couple of videos. Although it is too late to sign the petition, please lend your support any way you can...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal)\n",

They said that they would setup a telephone interview, and call me back.\n\nWell, after a while (still Thursday) I got a call back to see if I could meet one of their Senior Consultants that night as he was going to be in Glasgow anyway. I though bloody hell, what time.._\"How about in an hour and a half\"_..Oh shit...\n\nSo after a quick shower and shave I drove (I might not have mentioned that I popped my knee this month and can't drive without being in excruciating pain) out to the hotel next to the airport and had a three hour chat with the Senior ADC from Microsoft. After which I was asked down to Reading...\n\nExciting stuff. Until I got the schedule...\n\n- 12:00 - 13:00 Hiring Manager Interview\n- 13:00 - 14:00 Presentation\n- 14:00 - 16:00 Technical Interview\n\nOh man, what do I have to present on? The brief was of a fictitious ISV:\n\n> _We have used the .NET framework using C# on many successful previous projects and have been pleased with the whole development experience._\n>\n> _For our next project we believe that we have the requirement for some peer-to-peer type functionality._\n>\n> _As a busy customer we have arranged a 15-20 minute presentation slot for you to give to our key developers to give them an insight into peer-to-peer development on the Microsoft [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") platform._\n>\n> _We appreciate that the time slot is too short to cover this area fully but we want to get our key developers some idea of the concepts of this technology and its general usage._\n>\n> _An extra 5-10 minutes will be allocated after your presentation for questions from the audience._\n\nI have already blogged about how [badly the presentation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/06/Developing-Peer-To-Peer-Applications-With-WCF.aspx) went, but the technical interview was something else as well. I had about an hour on .NET and the rest on architecture.\n\nThe technical bit was going fine until they started asking questions on CLR, which I know the basics of, but the details I did not, so what did they ask? CLR, CLR and more CLR.\n\nSuffice to say that CLR was critical to getting the job, so I didn't. They did however give me loads of advice on what to do to get it in the future. Here is what I will have to do...\n\n- Learn all about the CLR, everything...\n- become a better public speaker...\n- have lots more practice at architecture...\n\nSo not a total loss. I have learned where my knowledge is deficient and how to rectify it...not a NO, but a NO for now...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [WCF](http://technorati.com/tags/WCF)\n",

TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 3 - Passing the events over a Windows Communication Foundation MSMQ (Coming soon)\n4. TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 4 - Workflow (Coming soon)\n\n# Handling Team Foundation Server Events\n\nBecause of the lack of support for [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") in the Team Edition for Architects I will be replacing all of the auto-generated services with [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") services. But as it turns out this messes up everything, so I have started from scratch and I will post all of the code for doing this without the Architect bit.\n\nThe first thing that you need is the Contract for Team Foundation Server event handling. This is very specific and only works if used accurately:\n\n> ```\n> Imports System.ServiceModel\n> Imports System.Runtime.Serialization\n> Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server\n>\n>     ''' <summary>\n>     ''' This is the service contract for integrating with the Team Foundation Server notification events.\n>     ''' </summary>\n>     ''' <remarks></remarks>\n>     <ServiceContract(Namespace:=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/TeamFoundation/2005/06/Services/Notification/03\")> _\n>     Public Interface INotification\n>\n>         ''' <summary>\n>         ''' The Notify method if fired whenever a subscribed event arrives.\n>         ''' </summary>\n>         ''' <param name=\"eventXml\">This XML defines the data that was changed on the event.</param>\n>         ''' <param name=\"tfsIdentityXml\">This XML identifies the Team Foundation Server the event came from.</param>\n>         ''' <param name=\"SubscriptionInfo\">Information about the subscriber</param>\n>         ''' <remarks></remarks>\n>         <OperationContract( _\n>                         Action:=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/TeamFoundation/2005/06/Services/Notification/03/Notify\", _\n>                         ReplyAction:=\"*\" _\n>                         )> _\n>         <XmlSerializerFormat( _\n>                         Style:=OperationFormatStyle.Document _\n>                         )> _\n>         Sub Notify(ByVal eventXml As String, ByVal tfsIdentityXml As String, ByVal SubscriptionInfo As SubscriptionInfo)\n>\n>     End Interface\n> ```\n\nThis code allows you to capture TFS events and we will be using by reference only. If you have been having trouble handling the events then look know further than here for [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") as this has been tried and tested.\n\nThe real trick for handling TFS events in [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") is that all the events come into the same routine. It would be nice if SubscriptionInfo listed what event it was, but alas it does not. So you may be thinking that you need to parse the XML and find out what type of event it is. Well you can if you want, but I find it easer to have more than one endpoint for the same service. You can then parse the URL for the event type, which is way easier than the XML as the events are all different.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create a project to hold the code. In the spirit of expedition, I have created a \"[Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") Service Application\" to hold all of the Notification service code. But in the real world you would keep the Contract and Implementation classes in different assemblies.\n\n[![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nNow we have the project, you can add the INotification class and the Notification service. I like to keep all of my services in a \"v1.0\" so that I can add other services in new versions without affecting the current version.\n\n[![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nOnce you have your INotification class looking like the code extract above we will add a default implementation and test the service. The default implementation should look like:\n\n> ```\n> Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server\n>\n> Public Class Notification\n>     Implements INotification\n>\n>     Public Sub Notify(ByVal eventXml As String, ByVal tfsIdentityXml As String, ByVal SubscriptionInfo As SubscriptionInfo) Implements INotification.Notify\n>\n>     End Sub\n>\n> End Class\n>\n> ```\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThis class just implements the INotification contract (interface) and has an empty Sub for the notify method that will be called when an event is fired in TFS.\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThe config file will contain a definition of the service as well as two endpoints for the same interface. The services and behaviours occur within the <system.serviceModel\\> tags.\n\n> ```\n> <system.serviceModel>\n>   <services>\n>    ...\n>   </services>\n>   <behaviors>\n>    ...\n>   </behaviors>\n> </system.serviceModel>\n> ```\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThis is the really important part of getting the service working, and goes between the <services\\> tags. The first part of the service configuration contains the service definition. Here we define the name of the service, which should be the same as full namespace and class name of out implementation, the behavior configuration name (we will look at this is a bit) and the endpoints.\n\n> ```\n> <service behaviorConfiguration=\"NotificationServiceBehavior\" name=\"RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.Notification\">\n>     <endpoint address=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.INotification\"/>\n>     <endpoint address=\"CheckInEvent\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" contract=\"RDdotNet.TFSEventHandler.NotificationHost.INotification\"/>\n>     <endpoint address=\"mex\" binding=\"mexHttpBinding\" contract=\"IMetadataExchange\"/>\n> </service>\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nIn a service hosted within IIS there is no need to set a base address as the location of the .svc file sets this for us. In this case it is [http://localhost:\\[port\\]/v1.0/Notification.svc](http://localhost:[port]/v1.0/Notification.svc). The \"mex\" endpoint allows other application to discover the capabilities of the service.\n\nThe other two endpoint point at the same contract and are in fact implemented by the same method in the service implementation. These two endpoints have different addressed so that we can tell team server to send events to different URL's but use the same code to process the events. You could add any of the TFS events in to this list of end points, but it is best to keep the names the same as the event being fired as we will detect it later. We are using the wsHttpBinding as the most advanced that TFS will support.\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nYou only need to set two options on the service behavior, the httpGetEnabled needs to be set to true for the WSDL and the meta data to work. This allows the discoverability of you services. The includeExceptionDetailInFaults option allows the diagnosis of faults when we test the service.\n\n> ```\n> <serviceBehaviors>\n>     <behavior name=\"NotificationServiceBehavior\">\n>         <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"true\"/>\n>         <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"true\"/>\n>     </behavior>\n> </serviceBehaviors>\n> ```\n\nThe service behaviors go between the <behaviors\\> tags and are named the same as the services behaviorConfiguration attribute.\n\nWe now have a working service and can test it by starting a new instance of the web application and going to the URL of the .svc file. You will see a page like:\n\n[![image](images/TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFS.5Part2HandlingTeamFoundationServerEv_1464E-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis shows you how you can connect to the service, but as this will only be connected to by TFS it is not a requirement for just now. What is important is to see the URL's for the two endpoints that we have created. If you click the WSDL URL (\"[http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc?wsdl](http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc?wsdl)\") you will see the generated meta data for the service.\n\nI am not going to display the full WSDL here as it is huge, but here is the important section for what we need to look at:\n\n> ```\n> <wsdl:service name=\"Notification\">\n>   <wsdl:port name=\"WSHttpBinding_INotification\" binding=\"tns:WSHttpBinding_INotification\">\n>     <soap12:address location=\"http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChangedEvent\"/>\n>     <wsa10:EndpointReference>\n>       <wsa10:Address>http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChanged</wsa10:Address>\n>       <Identity xmlns=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity\">\n>         <Upn>comuter1user1</Upn>\n>       </Identity>\n>     </wsa10:EndpointReference>\n>   </wsdl:port>\n>   <wsdl:port name=\"WSHttpBinding_INotification1\" binding=\"tns:WSHttpBinding_INotification\">\n>     <soap12:address location=\"http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/CheckInEvent\"/>\n>     <wsa10:EndpointReference>\n>       <wsa10:Address>http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/CheckIn</wsa10:Address>\n>       <Identity xmlns=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity\">\n>         <Upn>computer1user1</Upn>\n>       </Identity>\n>     </wsa10:EndpointReference>\n>   </wsdl:port>\n> </wsdl:service>\n> ```\n\nThis section of the WSDL highlights the service definition and the two endpoints that exist. We are now able to get TFS to send events to this service. To do this you need to add the URL's of the end points to the notification system within TFS. This is done by using a command line utility on the server, or by calling parts of the TFS API. For ease we will call the command line, but a future version should probably have a user interface to allow the administration of which TFS servers you want to handle events for.\n\nTo subscribe to the events you will need to use the BisSubscribe utility which you can find out how to use [here](http://olausson.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,d9948138-262e-4db0-94f1-4f0a033b0fb0.aspx), or you can use the API and provide an interface to add and remove subscriptions.\n\nIf you call:\n\n> BisSubscribe.exe /userId **TFSEventHandler** /eventType **WorkItemChangedEvent** /deliveryType **Soap** /address http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChanged\n\nUsing the untility you will subscribe to events using SOAP, or if you call:\n\n> ```\n> SubscribeEvent(tfsServer, \"TFSEventHandler\", \"http://localhost:65469/v1.0/Notification.svc/WorkItemChangedEvent\", DeliveryType.Soap, Schedule.Imediate, EventType.WorkItemChangedEvent)\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nUsing a API helper class similar to the one below:\n\n> ```\n>     ''' <summary>\n>     ''' Helper methods for subscribing to and from events\n>     ''' </summary>\n>     ''' <remarks></remarks>\n>     Public Class SubscriptionHelper\n>\n>         Public Shared Function SubscribeEvent(ByRef tfs As TeamFoundationServer, ByVal userName As String, ByVal deliveryAddress As String, ByVal Type As Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.DeliveryType, ByVal Schedule As Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.DeliverySchedule, ByVal EventType As EventTypes, Optional ByVal Filter As String = \"\") As Integer\n>             Dim eventService As IEventService = CType(tfs.GetService(GetType(IEventService)), IEventService)\n>             Dim delivery As DeliveryPreference = New DeliveryPreference()\n>             delivery.Type = Type\n>             delivery.Schedule = Schedule\n>             delivery.Address = deliveryAddress\n>             Return eventService.SubscribeEvent(userName, EventType.ToString, Filter, delivery)\n>         End Function\n>\n>         Public Shared Sub UnSubscribeEvent(ByRef tfs As TeamFoundationServer, ByVal subscriptionId As Integer)\n>             Dim eventService As IEventService = CType(tfs.GetService(GetType(IEventService)), IEventService)\n>             eventService.UnsubscribeEvent(subscriptionId)\n>         End Sub\n>\n>     End Class\n> ```\n\nI may write an article in the future on this, but all the code is part of the current [TFSEventHandler](http://tfseventhandler.codeplex.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk) application.\n\nWe now want to determine what sort of event has been raised in the Service implementation. To do this we need to parse the URL of the endpoint that has been raised and retrieve the event type.\n\n> ```\n> Dim UriString As String = OperationContext.Current.EndpointDispatcher.EndpointAddress.Uri.AbsoluteUri\n> Dim SlashIndex As Integer = UriString.LastIndexOf(\"/\")\n> Dim EndieBit As String = UriString.Substring(SlashIndex, (UriString.Length - (UriString.Length - SlashIndex)))\n> Dim EventType As EventTypes = CType([Enum].Parse(GetType(EventTypes), EndieBit), EventTypes)\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nAs you can see it is just a case of parsing the URL to get the last bit after the final \"/\" and then converting it to an enumerator.\n\n> ```\n> Public Enum EventTypes\n>     Unknown = 0\n>     AclChangedEvent\n>     Branchmovedevent\n>     BuildCompletionEvent\n>     BuildStatusChangeEvent\n>     CommonStructureChangedEvent\n>     DataChangedEvent\n>     IdentityChangedEvent\n>     IdentityCreatedEvent\n>     IdentityDeletedEvent\n>     MembershipChangedEvent\n>     WorkItemChangedEvent\n>     CheckinEvent\n> End Enum\n> ```\n\n[](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)The enumerator lists all of the events that are possible in TFS, but be warned that not all of the events fire effectively. Once you have the event it can be converted into an object. I use code from [Howard van Rooijen's TFS Project Template](http://blogs.conchango.com/howardvanrooijen/archive/2006/04/29/3894.aspx \"Howard van Rooijen's TFS Project Template\") for the event objects and [Larry Steinle's CustomXmlSerializer](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/CustomXmlSerializer.asp) code to convert the XML to Howard's objects resulting in the following code:\n\n> ```\n> Dim IdentityObject As TFSIdentity = EndpointBase.CreateInstance(Of TFSIdentity)(tfsIdentityXml)\n> Dim EventObject As WorkItemChangedEvent = EndpointBase.CreateInstance(Of WorkItemChangedEvent)(eventXml)\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nAll of the objects are now ready to pass over MSMQ to the TFS Event Processor, which will be the subject of the next article in this series...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Visual Studio Team System](http://technorati.com/tags/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System), [Visual Studio 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/Visual%20Studio%202008), [Team Edition for Architects](http://technorati.com/tags/Team%20Edition%20for%20Architects), [TFSEventHandler](http://technorati.com/tags/TFSEventHandler), [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://technorati.com/tags/Microsoft%20.NET%20Framework), [Software Industrial Revolution](http://technorati.com/tags/Software%20Industrial%20Revolution), [WCF](http://technorati.com/tags/WCF), [TFS Event Handler](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS%20Event%20Handler)\n",

Although the technical content was good, my delivery was not. I got stage fright...\n\nAs I approached the room to give the presentation in which I expected to see a couple of people, I was horrified to hear a clamor of voices, no, a venerable din of idle conversation coming from the room. _Not that room, please..._ but that was indeed the room, and I had to give my presentation to more than 25 highly technical people...It was fortunate at least that I had a copy of all of my notes, as my mind (what little was left after a day of traveling) dribbled slowly out of my ears...\n\nI had previously [presented on VSTS](http://skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/self.aspx/Public/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System/VSTS%20Presentation.ppt), but that was to a room of coworkers that somehow seamed less threatening.

The 45 minute [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\") presentation ended up taking 3 hours.\n\nSo, needless to say, I ended up having to almost totally read from my notes.

I did not think that [Jim Lamb](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimlamb/archive/2007/05/30/hosted-tfs-pilot-program.aspx \"Microsoft does indeed listen\") would be reading it and blog about Microsoft's internal ambition to have a hosted model for [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\"). I have been quite excited about this subjects as I have worked for many companies that would find the cost of running an internal TFS server prohibitive, but for whom a hosted option would be perfect.\n\nTo date there is only one hosted option and that is from [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/), if you are interested in hearing more about them then you should read their [blog](http://tfsnow.wordpress.com/2007/07/29/announcing-tfs-now-a-hosted-tfs-service/ \"microsoft does indeed listen\").\n\nNow, if you wanted to setup and offer Hosted TFS yourself, well, you can't. The licensing for TFS as the moment does not allow it but Microsoft is currently looking a this and we can probably expect to see something in this space some time in 2008/2009...\n\nIf you are wanting space on a TFS server, but not an actual server (usually because you have only one or two projects) you will have to wait until Rosario before these features will be available. It seams that TFS 2005 and 2008 are both impractical for this model, but Microsoft is looking to solve these problems in Rosario to allow multiple companies (clients) to share a single TFS instance.\n\nIn the hopes that some one is still listening there are a number of things that TFS requires to be more marketable, and not just for Development projects:\n\n- RAG reporting needs to be built into TFS for management reports\n- There needs to be a higher level of reports that can be used cross project\n- Some targeted presentations would be good (i.e. targeted at Project Managers, or Test Managers, or program managers, or just plain management.)\n\nI think Paul Slater will be posting a more detailed list, but you get the picture. There is not lacking in features for developers, testers or architects, but the ones that sign are paychecks and the budget for TFS are non technical management with little imagination...\n\nI would like to thank [Paul Slater](http://geekswithblogs.net/MMaI/Default.aspx) for his incite into the black art of \"Marketing TFS\" and [Jim Lamb](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimlamb) for continually answering stupid questions...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [TFS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2005)\n",

    "BodyContent": "After my post on the new [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) search engine a fellow by the name of [Anselm](http://www.searchcrystal.com/) pointed out [Search Crystal](http://www.searchcrystal.com \"http://www.searchcrystal.com\"), another visual search engine that produces some good result. I did not get he same Wow that I did from Tafiti, but the amount of information that is provided through the interface is extensive.\n\nYou can change the display of the results from Cluster (the default) to Spiral and list. I did find that the List option is very confusing and difficult to navigate, and the Spiral option seams of limited use to me personally. It was a good idea to use the cluster view as the default and I think they have put the most work into this part of the system.\n\nAll in all, it is very good, but I think that from a visual perspective the Tafiti interface works better, al be it with only one search engine.\n\nBelow you can see an example of the search results, and you should be able to play with it. This does indeed work on Virtual Workstations, while the tree view from Tafiti has some problems due to the slow refresh.\n\nHave you seen any other search visualization website's? Let me know...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia)\n",

I will be using as many of the features of Team Suit as I can, but bear with me as there are a few things that are new to me. I am going to create everything under source control in CodePlex.\n\n**TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Articles**\n\n1. [TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 1 - The Architecture](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/21/TFS-Event-Handler-in-NET-3-5-Part-1-The-Architecture.aspx)\n2.

TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 3 - Passing the events over a Windows Communication Foundation MSMQ (Coming soon)\n4. TFS Event Handler in .NET 3.5 Part 4 - Workflow (Coming soon)\n\n# The Architecture\n\nThe first toy I am going to play with is the Team Edition for Architecture components of Team Suit. This will hopefully allow me to create a system that has a bit of foresight and planning associated with it. I have played with these features before, but I have not, up until now, used them in battle.\n\nI have created a blank solution in my TFS Event Handler Codeplex project, so it is time to create the \"Distributed System Diagram\" that I will use to define the architecture of the system.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb-19-19.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image.png) When you create the diagrams they are added to the Solution and not a specific project. These diagrams will be linked to the code that we will eventually create allowing us to view these diagrams even if we have made changes. They will update automatically with any  architectural changes that I have made after coding had started.\n{ .post-img }\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe logical place to start is with the Application Diagram, and this is highlighted by default. The other diagrams are usefully as well. The Logical Datacenter diagram will allow you to assign parts of the application to different servers and control the communication between these servers. The System Diagram is used to define logical systems that communicate with each other.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_2-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou get a number of diagrammatic options in the toolbox. The Applications section list all of the types of applications that are going to be in your solution and represents the projects that are going to be created under your solution. If you add a Windows Application for example, you will get a windows application project within your Visual Studio solution. It is worth noting that there is no need to think about \"individual projects like what assemblies am I going to need\", or \"how will I arrange my namespaces\" at this point. All we are interested is the main building blocks of the application.\n\n## Application Diagram\n\nThe first application that I know that I am going to need are Web Service applications to handle the incoming events from Team Foundation Server and a web service that will allow us to configure any options for this part of the system and the subscriptions to team servers.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_3-13-13.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nNow that I have added a web service you can see that it is just a different type of Web Application. This will need some configuring to be what we want. I have chosen to only handle two of the events that TFS throws, WorkItemChangedEvent and CheckInEvent. There are many other events that could be handled, but these two are probably the most common.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_4-14-14.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_4.png) [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_5-15-15.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_5.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe completed service looks quite simple, but we now need to configure it to allow it to work effectively. If you leave everything as defaults you end up having a hundred things to change later, so it is way better to get it out of the way and polish it at this stage.  There are different setting available for each application and endpoint type, so the best thing to do is to look though all of the options and se what is what. You can see from the image right that I have configures all of the options on the service end \\[point and I repeated this on all of the endpoints. Many of these setting are used when we generate the code at the end of this process.\n\nThe second application is the decision service. It has a MSMQ service endpoint called EventReciever that the notification service passes all of the events that it has received to. This service will then execute all of the events against the Workflow service that will perform any activities associated with the event. The reason for the EventReciever service is to make the system more robust. Because the EventReciever is a MSMQ service the Notification Service can still send messages to it even when it is down.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_6-16-16.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe final end point to add is a web based administration system for the workflow system. I have added all of the links between the applications that define the communication between the services. The ability to create these diagrams is not limited to being done at the start of the process, you can add this diagram to any solution and it will have all of your applications and links defined already. This is because there is a direct link between the solution and the diagrams. You can change either and affect both with the change, and this does not just apply to these architecture diagrams but to the Class diagrams that are part of Team Edition for Development.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_8-17-17.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_8.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWith the application diagram done, I can now do an number of things. One of which is to \"implement All Application\" which will build my main projects for me.\n\nWhat I am going to do first is take you though the \"Define Deployment\" and \"Design Application System\" options to get a better understanding of the capabilities of the system. Before I can do this, I will need to create a Logical Datacenter diagram to define what infrastructure is available, namely a single server that may or may not be the same server that Team Foundation Server is installed on.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_9-18-18.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_9.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIn creating the Logical Datacenter I realized that I had made a mistake in my diagram of the system and I had not allowed for the additional web interfaces for the application. I have updated the diagram to reflect the problems I encountered. The diagram now has a separate web administration application that talks to both of the main admin services to get information and to make changes to the way that the system operates.\n\nIt has two web end points, one for administering the workflow in the event handler and the other for administering the subscriptions for the notification service.\n\nThis is one of the best advertisements for this way of working as you spot more of the mistakes at this point and not half way through coding.\n\n## Logical Datacenter Diagram\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_10-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_10.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe logical datacenter diagram is very simple for this application as I want it to run initially in a single server environment. At the moment I have no need for a database, but it can easily be added to the system at a later date, I could even separate out the services from the website without having to change much of anything as far as the developers are concerned, it just impacts the architects.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_11-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_11.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe options that you get are mainly self explanatory, you can add \"Zones\" which are your firewall areas and put your servers with these areas. You can then add endpoints and their links through the firewalls to show how communication occurs. You can add all of your firewall rules into the system so it more readily replicated your network.\n\nFor this application I only have one zone and one line of communication as all other communication takes place on the server.\n\nYou could have a much more complicated infrastructure, but for this application it is unnecessary.\n\n## Deployment Diagram\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_13-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_13.png)  [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_19-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_19.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe deployment diagram allows you to place all of you applications onto the diagram so you can define the  communication lines and determine wither the applications can talk to each other in the desired way.\n\nIn this case we only have one Zone and one server with HTTP inbound for the web sites. You can see from the diagram that I have added all of the applications to the one server.\n\n## System Diagram\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_14-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_14.png) [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_18-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_18.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIf you have a complicated system with more than a few applications you will want to brake up the diagram into manageable Systems that you can see the input and output of the system. You could say that there is a Core system that contains the web services and that only two of the web services are accessible outside of the system. If you add the applications to a System diagram and right click on a web services you get the option to create a \"Proxy endpoint\" that sites at the edge of the system but is linked to the main service.\n\nI can now create a From End System diagram that has the website and only a definition of the Core system without any of the internal components.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_15-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_15.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou can see the result in the diagram to the left. In much larger system it allow your to view the components and the interaction of the components from a variety of differing angles to see how the whole thing interacts.\n\n## Implementation\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_20-11-11.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_20.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe last part of this is to initiate the implementation of all the application that I have created. This will create the projects under a solution that can then be used to build the final application.\n\n[![image](images/TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_thumb_21-12-12.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerin.5Part1TheArchitecture_8892-image_21.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAs you an see, without doing any code or creating any projects within VS manually I have a full solution. That is my job as the architect over, unless there are any changes from development. This would not be handed over to the developers for completion.\n\nNOTE: I have found that using this method you can only create ASMX services, and not WCF. This will hopfully (PLEASE) be sorted for RTM of Visual Studio 2008.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Visual Studio Team System](http://technorati.com/tags/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System), [Visual Studio 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/Visual%20Studio%202008), [Team Edition for Architects](http://technorati.com/tags/Team%20Edition%20for%20Architects), [TFSEventHandler](http://technorati.com/tags/TFSEventHandler), [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://technorati.com/tags/Microsoft%20.NET%20Framework), [Software Industrial Revolution](http://technorati.com/tags/Software%20Industrial%20Revolution)\n",

[Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) that's what.\n\n[![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nTafiti is a new search front end from Microsoft, it is still in beta, but what a beta. I think you would need a reasonably good computer to run it, but from a dyslexic persons point of view it is revolutionary. Although it does not give you the complete ability to search visually, it goes a long way to achieving it. Hopefully many other people will find it as equally usefully as I do...\n\nWhat do I like so much about it you may ask... Well...\n\n[![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb-5-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI love the way you can select what type of data to view from the search, there is a little spinning widget at the bottom left of the screen that you can use to view only feeds or web among other things. It is easy to use and extremely obvious what each button does (I think some hallway usability testing went on here).\n\n[![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_2-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI love the way you can pile up search terms on top of each other and then get back to your previous search with ease.  Although it could do with a way to flip between them...There is a way to filter your searches even further to tweak the results.\n\n[![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_3.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI love the way that you can save searches in your never ending search for what you are looking for. You can even add labels, although I have not worked out what they are for yet, but I am sure that it will be cool.\n\nAll that in itself would be good, but the best is yet to come. This is the bit that makes this a must use for all dyslexic people all over the world (well in English speaking countries so far).\n\n[![image](images/Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_thumb_4-4-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Searchjustgotbetter_12674-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe screen shot does not really do it justice, but this is an fantastic way to search the web. I have been doing some searching and, so far, I have been able to find exactly what I was looking for very quickly. Even obscure things we easy to find. This gets the thumbs up from a Scottish dyslexic software developer, and I can't wait to email the link to everyone. I have to thank [Larry Larsen](http://on10.net/Blogs/larry/first-look-microsoft-tafiti/) for pointing this out to me, and I hope the [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) team have even more cool search help up their sleeves.\n\nI will be keeping my eye on this and I hope that even after continued use I am still using it as my main search engine: Oh, I just thought, we have Virtual Workstations in the office and I will need to see if it even works on them: I know that video, flash and big Powerpoint presentations do not.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia) [Live](http://technorati.com/tags/Live) [Answers](http://technorati.com/tags/Answers)\n",

    "BodyContent": "Instead of using the proxy generation features of Visual Studio you can create a custom proxy in .NET 3.0 to handle all of your needs in a more maintainable manor and with less code. This method works best when you have access to the interfaces that created the service.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n> ```\n> Namespace TeamFoundation.Proxies\n>\n>     Public Class TeamServersClient\n>         Inherits System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase(Of Services.Contracts.ITeamServers)\n>         Implements RDdotNet.Proxies.IClientProxy\n>         Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers\n>\n>         Public Sub New(ByVal callbackInstance As System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext, ByVal binding As System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding, ByVal remoteAddress As System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress)\n>             MyBase.New(callbackInstance, binding, remoteAddress)\n>         End Sub\n>\n>         Public Sub AddServer(ByVal TeamServerName As String, ByVal TeamServerUri As String) Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.AddServer\n>             MyBase.Channel.AddServer(TeamServerName, TeamServerUri)\n>         End Sub\n>\n>         Public Function GetServers() As String() Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.GetServers\n>             Return MyBase.Channel.GetServers\n>         End Function\n>\n>         Public Sub RemoveServer(ByVal TeamServerName As String) Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.RemoveServer\n>             MyBase.Channel.RemoveServer(TeamServerName)\n>         End Sub\n>\n>         Public Function ServceUrl() As System.Uri Implements Services.Contracts.ITeamServers.ServceUrl\n>             Return MyBase.Channel.ServceUrl()\n>         End Function\n>\n>     End Class\n>\n> End Namespace\n> ```\n\nBecause your classes implements the service's interface when that interface changes you will be notified in Visual Studio that this has happened. This is a boon during development as changes can happen often.\n\nThis particular class is a duplex proxy, so communication can go both ways. You can download the source code for this from [here](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/SourceControl/DownloadSourceCode.aspx?changeSetId=8644).\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [SOA](http://technorati.com/tags/SOA)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have been tinkering with VS2008 for a week now, but I had not had time to really look at it.\n\nThey have made the interface slicker, and faster making the whole experience a little nicer.\n\n[![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb-7-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWhen you go to create new projects you get a number of nice options that allow you to target multiple versions of the .NET Framework with a single IDE. This will be of real advantage to those companies that still want to use .NET 2.0 while still evaluating 3.0 and 3.5.\n\n[![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIt should come as no surprise though that you will need to upgrade any existing projects to the new solution and project specifications in VS2008 so unfortunately you will no longer be able to open your projects in VS2005 after the upgrade has completed.\n\nIf you use Team System, you should baseline your projects first as the upgrade process disconnects you from source control and you can't reconnect it. Hopefully this will be fixed for the RTM, but it could well be something we will need to live with for the change over.\n\nAs you switch between the framework options the list of possible projects changes and you can see what has been added, but not the updates to functionality.\n\n[![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_2-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_2.png) [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_3.png) [![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_4-4-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_4.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe screen shots above gives you an idea of what will be available for the different frameworks for Windows.\n\nIn the [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") section though I got a pleasant surprise as they have added some workflow options to the list of services you can have. I assume that these are nice shortcuts to have, but that you could produce the same thing manually.\n\n[![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_5-5-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_5.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThe addition of the Syndication Service Library is a nice touch though.\n\nOne of the things to watch is that even if you cerate an application that targets .NET 2.0 and add a Setup project to the mix, you will need to manually change the prerequisites from .NET 3.5 to .NET 2.0 yourself as .NET 3.5 is the default.\n\n[![image](images/UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_thumb_6-6-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UsingVisualStudio2008_CDB8-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis is only mildly annoying as the .NET Framework 3.5 installer will automatically install .NET 2.0 if it is not there already. Once VS2008 is in RTM I think I would leave it set to the default, that was there is only one big install and you know that when you start using .NET 3.5 features you will only have a small install to go.\n\nIf you are connecting to a Team Foundation Server you will still need to install the \"Team Explorer\" client as it is not included. Personally I think it should be included in all versions of Visual Studio as standard, but I think it is likely that we will continue to be required to install it separately.\n\nOne of the really nice features in VS2008 the the ability to debug and step through JavaScript! I think I just heard your jaw hitting the floor! That's right, you can debug JavaScript. Oh for this feature 5 years ago...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

These are the things that will help you identify the problem and rectify it. In this case the Team Foundation Server Project Creation Wizard is trying to create a sub site under what it thinks is a managed path of [http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/](http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/).\n\nNow the default setup for Sharepoint is that there is a managed path called \"Sites\" that sits under the main directory and this is the default for creating sub sites using [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\"). But in this case there is already a site created in Sharepoint called \"Sites\" that is a portal to the other sites in Sharepoint including site maps and the like. (try your equivalent of [http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/](http://rddotnettech.amrs.win.rddotnet.com/sites/) to see what is there. You will also need to check the Sharepoint Administration site for the settings. To do this you need to go to the Sharepoint Administraion site:\n\n[![image](images/TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nAnd click on \"Application Management\" and then on \"Define managed paths\".\n\n[![image](images/TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nYou should then see a list of the defined managed paths for the particular application (1) and you can change the application that you are looking at (2).\n\n[![image](images/TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamFoundationServerErrorTF30177ProjectC_D920-image_2.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nWhat needs to be done is to choose a new managed path as this one is taken and to add it to the Sharepoint server. Make sure that you check the server for sites of the same name, you could use \"TFSProjects\" so as not to get an overlap.\n\nOnce you have added this Managed Path you will need to modify TFS to create sites under that path. To do this please refer to my previous post \"[Team Foundation Server Error TF30177 : Team Project Creation Failed](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/14/Team-Foundation-Server-Error-TF30177--Team-Project-Creation-Failed.aspx)\" which tells you how to update the project references.\n\nWell that's it, debugging team server errors is fun, but not for the faint hearted...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [SP 2010](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010) [SharePoint](http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint)\n",

    "BodyContent": "When you create your first project, you may get an error during the creation process. When you look at the log file and see a \"proxy error\" message detail it may be to do with the way that TFS installs.\n\nI  many large networks you can't connect to the server in the browser if you use the server name. This is because the proxy server is checking DNS for the name and unless you get every server in your company added to the proxy PAC file, you will get an error. To see if this is the issue try putting the server name into the browser:\n\nhttp://myServerName.\n\nIf you get the error then you should try the FQDN:\n\nhttp://myServerName.myInternalDomain.com\n\nIf this work then you need to change the URL's within TFS that it uses to define these calls. You can check what the current settings are by:\n\n1. Open http://tfs01.uk.company.com:8080/Services/v1.0/Registration.asmx in your browser.\n2. Click on GetRegistrationEntries.\n3. Then click on Invoke.\n\nSave (or just view) the resultant XML so you can have a look at it. There are two section of importance here. One is the Reports section which will look like:\n\n> ```\n> <RegistrationEntry>\n>   <Type>Reports</Type>\n>   <ServiceInterfaces>\n>     <ServiceInterface>\n>       <Name>BaseReportsUrl</Name>\n>       <Url>http://[serverName]/Reports</Url>\n>     </ServiceInterface>\n>     <ServiceInterface>\n>       <Name>DataSourceServer</Name>\n>       <Url>[serverName]</Url>\n>     </ServiceInterface>\n>     <ServiceInterface>\n>       <Name>ReportsService</Name>\n>       <Url>http://[serverName]/ReportServer/ReportService.asmx</Url>\n>     </ServiceInterface>\n>   </ServiceInterfaces>\n>   <Databases />\n>   <EventTypes />\n>   <ArtifactTypes />\n>   <RegistrationExtendedAttributes />\n> </RegistrationEntry>\n> ```\n>\n> [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)\n\nThe second is the is the WSS section that is in the same format.\n\nNow, we have established that \\[serverName\\] will not work so we will have to update TFS with the new details. To do this you need to:\n\n1. Create an XML file called RSRegister.xml with just the xml above.\n2. Modify the server name from \\[serverName\\] to the FQDN of the server and save it.\n3. on the TFS server you need to open a command prompt and execute the following:\n   1. `iisreset /stop`\n   2. `cd \"%programfiles% Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation ServerTools\"`\n   3. `TFSReg.exe RSRegister.xml [yourDataTierServerName`\\]\n   4. i`isreset /start`\n4. Then call the web service above to make sure that the settings are correct.\n\nYou can repeat this for the WSS (Windows Sharepoint Services) section.\n\nAll done and TFS should work. Although it is worth noting that in my company environment I could then no longer create projects from the TFS App server itself as \\[serverName\\] works but the FQDN did not.

    "BodyContent": "Rather than confuse the issue with my verbal dexterity (or excrement from my brain is more likely) I will quote from a source on the web:\n\n> [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") is an inherited condition. Researchers have determined that a gene on the short arm of chromosome #6 is responsible for [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\"). That gene is dominant, making [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") highly heritable. It definitely runs in families.\n>\n> [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") results from a neurological difference; that is, a brain difference. People with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") have a larger right-hemisphere in their brains than those of normal readers. That may be one reason people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") often have significant strengths in areas controlled by the right-side of the brain, such as artistic, athletic, and mechanical gifts; 3-D visualization ability; musical talent; creative problem solving skills; and intuitive people skills.\n>\n> In addition to unique brain architecture, people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") have unusual \"wiring\". Neurons are found in unusual places in the brain, and are not as neatly ordered as in non-dyslexic brains.\n>\n> In addition to unique brain architecture and unusual wiring, f/MRI studies have shown that people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") do not use the same part of their brain when reading as other people. Regular readers consistently use the same part of their brain when they read. People with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") do not use that part of their brain, and there appears to be no consistent part used among dyslexic readers.\n>\n> It is therefore assumed that people with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") are not using the most efficient part of their brain when they read. A different part of their brain has taken over that function.\n\nAs a result of this dyslexic children often start with a lack of  [phonetic awareness](http://www.dys-add.com/define.html#Phonemic) that impairs their ability to learn in school. Teachers assume that this phonetic awareness exists and thus the child is at a disadvantage before they even start learning.\n\nI hope from this you can see that although dyslexic people start with a disadvantage caused by the way we are taught in school, if they manage to get past that hurdle then the tend to end up with an advantage in the long run...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia)\n",

Well I got 80% through the book, got board, and stopped... I even managed to get my company to buy me all of the books for the MCPD and they are just sitting on the shelve at home.

I have not met many developer who have the same avid interest in technology as me. Many developers seam to think that being a developer is _just_ a _**career**!_ Perish the thought, its more than a career, its an adventure...\n\nWell I think that I am done...yes, I'm done...Now all that is left is to tag some people. I think I would tag Sandy Cormie and Ajay Patwari if they had blogs, but I will tag [Jason Franks](http://geekswithblogs.net/jasonfranks/archive/2007/08/12/Better.Dev.aspx) because he makes me laugh, [Mickey Gousset](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/) because TFS is cool, and [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/) because he is an inspired speaker who can also write code...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia) [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal)\n",

    "BodyContent": "The reasons I think that VB.NET is better than C# are many, but I will try to put some of them down in a coherent manor unlike the usual C# developer that can only come up with \"[vb is a language for mediocre programmers...anyway looks ugly and smells ugly..](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/05/114415.aspx#140605)\" (Hmm, he must have thought long and hard to come up with that).\n\n**Reason 1 - Business sense**\n\nliviu is right that many mediocre programmers are VB programmers. This is because VB is easier to read and easier to code, thus there are actually many more VB.NET programmer than C# in the world, so ov course there are more mediocre ones, statistics demand that. But this is its advantage, you can have a superb developer produce your application, then have on of the mediocre programmers maintain it. This keeps costs down for the business, and frees up the superb programmers time to work on the next complex project.\n\n**Reason 2 - Visual sense**\n\nThe readability of VB.NTE is what makes it more popular. Take these pieces of code for example:\n\n![](images/image_thumb.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nor (thanks [Mihir Solanki](http://www.mihirsolanki.com/) for the timely translation)\n\n> NorthwindDataContext ctx = new NorthwindDataContext();\n>\n> var query = from c in ctx.Customers  \n>                   where c.Country == \"UK\"  \n>                   select new { Name = c.ContactTitle + \" \" + c.ContactName };\n>\n> foreach (var c in query.Skip(2).Take(3))  \n> {  \n> Console.WriteLine(c.Name);  \n> }\n\nForget for a moment that the VB is nicely formatted, this looks pretty similar. There are the same number of lines. The same amount of text. But I find the VB version easier to read as it is more logical, it flows better and you can read it much more effectively.\n\nBut this is just personal preference.\n\n**Reason 3 - Disability friendly**\n\nVB.NET unlike C# is not case sensitive. I have always wondered why in this day and age that C# is still case sensitive. It seams to me that this is a historical thing, but it just avoids confusion and makes you code more readable if \"variable\" and \"Variable\" and \"vaRiable\" are the same thing and not different.\n\nIf you are [dyslexic like me](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/23/What-is-dyslexiaAgain.aspx) then this is very confusing as although \"r\" and \"R\" are difficult to confuse, \"v\" and \"V\" is the same letter, only slightly bigger. This means that you code is more accessible and disability friendly if you do not have case sensitivity.\n\n**Reason 4 - Intellisense**\n\nOh how I love intellisense, the joy to have all of your code write itself. In effect this makes the argument of C# being more concise mute, as your code almost writes itself.\n\n**Reason 5 - Dynamic checking**\n\nUsing VB.NET I do not need to wait till compile time to see if I have any typos or errors in my code and the \"write-time\" compiler for VB.NET checks my code as I type. As a dyslexic who can write the same work six times in the same object differently and not be able to see the difference you can imagine how helpfully this is.\n\nWould you like Word to only check your spelling when you try to save, and refuse to save until you had fixed it? I think not...\n\n**Reason 6  - Personal**\n\nI don't know if it is a symptom of my dyslexia, but curly brackets ({ and }) give me the heebie jeebies and I find I am unable to see where one method, or loop ends and the others begin. If it is part of my dyslexia then that is an even better proponent of VB.NET over C# and should be added to reason 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAlthough the use of VB.NET over C# is a personal preference it also has many advantages. The more noted of which is Readability, disability friendly and 'write-time' code checking. With all this it is actually faster to write in VB than C#.\n\nLets all try to make our code more accessible and use VB.NET.\n\nP.S. I don't know what I am doing wrong, I can't seems to 'smell' any of my code, neither VB.NET or C#. Hmm...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Dyslexia](http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia)\n",

The issue with Hosted [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") is that there is no real partitioning of projects within the system and thus if you had two clients on the same server they would be able to view each others data.\n\nI even asked a [question](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/46649-1363184?browseIdx=0&sik=1186315050351&goback=%2Eahp%2Eamq) on LinkedIn and got an amazing response.\n\nYou may think that this is an oversight, but TFS was not really designed for the hosted environment. The problem is that in my company we would need to keep different areas of the business separate. This requires separate instances of Team Foundation Server for this to work.\n\nThere are changes coming in Orcas that will help with this and ones in Rosario that should solve the problems and allow proper hosting.\n\nAt this time there is only one commercial hosted team server called [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/) that has been blogged about by [Jeff Beehler](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/07/31/hosted-tfs-available-from-readify.aspx \"hosted team foundation server\") and [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/07/30/the-first-commercial-tfs-hosting-service-is-live.aspx) last month.\n\nCheck out [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/ \"TFS Now\")...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

In my battles to get my company to use Team Foundation Server I recently contacted the manager of the most highly regarded development team in the company.\n\nApart from being initially disheartened by his initial question \"Does it run on Unix?\" the manager of the team's main reservation was that he is always dubious about a product from  Microsoft that they do not use internally...\n\nObviously he has not had much exposure to [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") otherwise he would know that Microsoft now has 21 instances of TFS running for its internal development teams with a total of 734 projects and 5,600 users.\n\nNow that is around 10% of all Microsoft employees, which is quite impressive for a product that has been out less than two years.\n\nThis internal use seams to be encouraging Microsoft to put a lot of effort into this product and Service Pack 1 was released within a year and version 2 ([Orcas](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/) or [Visual Studio 2008 Team Foundation Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/)) will be available by the end of this year, with version 3 ( [Rosario](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/08/04/rosario-august-ctp-released.aspx \"rosario august ctp released\") or Visual Studio 20XX Team Foundation Server) to follow.\n\nThe future is bright, the future is [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx \"Visual Studio Team System\")...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [VS 2008](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2008) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

Personally I think that this is a job for a Project Manager, not a developer, as it is about management and is not particularly technical. You do not actually have to carry out any of the work on the application, just:\n\n- Manage the relationship with the vendor\n- Manage the infrastructure teams to keep the application running\n- Manage all issues and problems with the application\n- Manage any updates to the application\n- Manage all access to the production system\n- Manage any documentation for the system and its operation\n- Manage SOX audits on applications that require it\n\nThis is no small task and incorporates only part of my job. When everything is well, there is little to do, but as usual everything happens at once.\n\nI currently own:\n\n- Our general ledger application (soon to be decommissioned)\n- All of our Mortgage Souring systems (around six applications)\n- Visual Studio Team System (includes Team Explorer, Web Access to Team System, Office Integration, )\n- a CRM that I built\n- and a few others\n\nI am performing a SOX audit on our general ledger application and all of our Mortgage Sourcing application have stopped working due mainly to the way they are built being incompatible with our infrastructure.\n\nFixing these problems, or managing the solutions is slow and painfully. At least my company has just implemented a SOX audit management system that is taking the audit from two months last year to only a few weeks this year.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

Needless to say it has been difficult and my copy of the documentation is now full of notes to take back to the vendor.

It has much nicer features than TeamPlain 1.0 and is much more stable that 2.0RC.\n\nI still have the old long project name problem:\n\n[![image](images/2788dc67eeca_9897-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2788dc67eeca_9897-image.png) \n{ .post-img }\n\nBut I already have a [solution](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/04/02/TeamPlain_Revisit.aspx \"TeamPlain Revisit\") for this, but it will probably need some modification, although I have confirmed that it works just fine with 2.0RC.\n\nThere is still the problem of not being able to go directly to a work item from an external link and this will prohibit us going into production with this. I did raise this on the Microsoft Forum for TeamPlain, but maybe it is a bigger issue.\n\n[![image](images/2788dc67eeca_9897-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2788dc67eeca_9897-image_1.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI use my [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") Event Handler to send out an email to anyone a work item is assigned to, which could by anyone in the company (75,000 users) but in reality only those on the project get emails.

    "BodyContent": "In the modern era networking is not just the preview of business men. There have been many sites created over the last few years but they only seam to implement one or maybe two if the strategies for providing either a community or business networking site. A [list of social networking sites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites \"list of social networking sites\") can be found on Wikipedia.\n\nThe problem with the current [social networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) is that you need to set all of them up separately, and although they provide ways to import your contacts it is time consuming and is prone to error if your contact details are out of date.\n\nWhat we need is a central contact, connection and linking system that all of these sites can communicate with to update their details. Such a system would, of course, require to be secure and have the ability to partition the data so that it only pulled information on people who are registered for the calling site.\n\nIf it used CardSpace (or similar) to authenticate users then users could be identified whatever community site they were using. To add to security the core service could provide components, or a client infrastructure that could pull back data and present it without the community site being able to skim it, allowing users to invite their friends from other networks to other specialist networks. This way if a user updates their email address on one service it is updated on them all.\n\nI have started a [Community Foundation](http://www.codeplex.com/RDdotNet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Community%20Foundation&referringTitle=Home) to provide this but it is still in the early stages, and honestly, the amount I have learned in the last few years, would require a sever refractor.\n\nIf I coupled this with some of the more recent features I have been working on a service could be created that would provide a hosted community service that would provide a Framework for any community site (all right, only the ones in .NET).\n\nIn this way some of the more complicated, but usefully services provided by social networking sites would be much easier to implement for fledgling services.\n\nI will need to think of some sort of pricing model tough... Hmm, maybe [Paul Slater](http://geekswithblogs.net/MMaI/ \"Paul Slater's Blog\") can help; if he ever posts to his blog!\n\n_A possible pricing model:_\n\n- _A service access charge  +_\n- _Per user cost: with the cost per user being divided between all the services that a particular user uses +_\n- _Per transaction charge for communicating with the service_\n\n_This model may be complicated but would be fairer to smaller sites, while still charging more for small sites that have a high number of transactions._\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SOA](http://technorati.com/tags/SOA)\n",

    "BodyContent": "[Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") is many thing to many people, but it always involves reading. Some people are heavily dyslexic to the point where the are unable to function at all in normal schooling. Many people think of [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") as a disability, but the only time I think of it that way is if I can get something:\n\n- Free laptop, Dictaphone and other things at university.\n- Extra time in exams (in the UK it is 15 minutes for every hour)\n\nThe rest of the time I use my [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\") as a gift!\n\nIt would be different if I did not work with computers. With spell check at least all of the words are spelled correctly (if not always the correct word), but in the real world, it is the ability to get your point across that is the big advantage to [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/ \"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\"). Dyslexic people have a very high level of Oral skills and coupled with the ability to visualize things in three dimensions it is a boon to anyone.\n\nThe three dimensional visualization is one of the reasons that spelling and working with words is a problem. Take the letters \"b\", \"d\", \"p\" and \"q\": A non-dyslexic will see four different letters, but I see a single letter that is at four different orientations. Mirror a \"b\" and it becomes a \"d\", and many time I can't see the different between these letters.\n\nDespite this I can actually read very fast, around a hundred pages in an hour of a novel. This is because I have developed the visual compensation of reading the shape of the words and not the word itself.\n\n**You wlil fnid taht you are sltil albe to raed tihs txet qiute elsiay eevn tuhgoh I hvae jbuelmd the ltetres auonrd, as lnog as I keep the fsirt lteetr and the lsat leettr in the smae plcae.

    "BodyContent": "Over the past week I have been working on creating and documenting a deployment process for our new main business application. This application is very complicated and requires twenty servers per four environments. We need to track and control deployment to UAT, pre-production, production and C&R (disaster recovery site), but my company as a larger organization only requires control of production.\n\nNow at the moment all the deployments are done by the vendor and is done by updating Assemblies on various servers, then running a custom tool that updates the config files based on the version of the assembly that has been updated. All database updates are currently done manually, and I rather doubt that there is any pre scripted rollback for the schema changes.\n\nI have been tasked with coming up with a solution that allows us and not the vendor to easily update and rollback any deployments necessary. Now, this project has been one of those \"Of-The-Shelf\" products that has required eight months of \"configuration\" (I can configure any system with Visual Studio too) and is not yet stable.\n\nThe application is made up of over twenty components that exist on multiple servers over multiple environments and soon over multiple instances.\n\nOnce it is stable however, I would like to see the vendor providing their updates the same way that any major application is delivered:\n\n- The Major Release (v1.0 to v2.0) + rollup of all Service Packs and Hotfixes\n- the Service Pack (v1.0 to v1.1) + rollup of Hotfixes\n- and the Hotfix (v1.0 to v1.0.1)\n\nIf it works :) then we will be able to do deploy any number of instances of the solution and be able to replicate any version of the solution.\n\nI want the vendor to provide MSI or EXE's for all releases of each of the components, but the rollback function must be implemented religiously. This will reduce the risk in any deployment as it currently takes two to three days to do a clean build of the application. It should also force the vendor to invest in the quality of their application, because if any of the installations or rollbacks go wrong in the Dev environment then we will \"return to sender\" for a recheck or rebuild.\n\n**Has anyone ever tried to get their vendor to do this?**\n\n**Has anyone been successfully?**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET)\n",

The benefits of having dyslexia far outweigh the negatives: The concepts of multi-dimensional thinking are incredibly difficult to learn if you have not been born with the ability, and if you are dyslexic, you have.\n\nThe advantages of Multi-Dimensional thinking is that you can visualize problems from all different angles and provide a solution that would not have occurred to a linear thinker. Although [Sigmund Void](http://www.sigmundvoid.com/?p=75 \"The gift that keeps giving.\") mentioned three dimensional thinking, the capability of thinking in more than three dimensions can assist you enormously if you are a software developer.\n\nI am not saying that all dyslexic people can think in more than three dimensions, but they are all **capable** of it: not everyone is...\n\nThe advantages of being a Free Thinker are also incalculable. It adds a creative element to the way your brain works and makes incredibly complex ideas seam simple. The disadvantage is getting others to understand you, but this is off-set by dyslexic people usually having superb oral skills.\n\nProfessions for such talented people include but is not limited to:\n\nengineers, architects, designers, artists and craftspeople, mathematicians, physicists, physicians (esp. surgeons and orthopedists), dentists, it professionals (esp.

    "BodyContent": "Well in my current war to get my company to use [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\"), I am loosing the battle for Visual Studio Team System adoption. I have fought many battles, against Jira, Confluence and Subversion, but they are currently wining. I cant seam to get the Architecture & Strategy guys to get behind the project. They are sitting on the sidelines encouraging me, but with no active participation.\n\nTime and again I am running up against the problem that no one will read any of the content that I have provided. It is difficult to fight a battle on many fronts and the fact that Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server is such an excellent product with complete integration between all of its services is actually not working in its favor.\n\nOthers are able to concentrate on selling Jira to one group of people while others are concentrating on selling Subversion. I have to lobby them all...\n\nThe call has now come down from on high to have all Risks and Issues stored in Jira. This will cripple the effectiveness of my arguments as the best arguments for the business revolve around Work Item Tracking, as they don't really care if the developers can link their source code to tasks, or test results to Releases or even bugs to Change Requests.\n\nThus, I have created a [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") project for [TFS Work Item Tracking to Jira Synchronization](http://www.codeplex.com/TfsWitToJiraSync) in the hopes that some enterprising developers would be interested in working on the code. I will not have time to work directly on the code as all development projects are now being outsourced to our Indian development team or to external companies, and I have been relegated to the bench of release management  documentation...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

There was a time that I was allowed to Code for a living and not just support applications and document deployment strategies. I have ended up filling my free time with my love of Coding and now, with the new baby, I find that my free time is drying up.\n\nMy current thoughts are to expand into the field of contracting. That way when I get board I can just not renew my contract and find some greener pastures. The reason that I have not done this is the past is fear! Fear of having no income; fear of starting something new. I feel that it is time to bite the bullet and get on the Money ladder like 50% of my coworkers...\n\nTo that end I have been asking about and it seams that the going rate for a bog standard developer is around £300 per day... My, that would be nice. And I would hope that I am no bog standard developer! How many developers are already up on .NET 3.0, Team Foundation Server and Sharepoint 2007. How many developers are familiar with large scale deployments, enterprise architectures, disaster recovery and software factories.\n\nI have turned down contracts before for a lot more than £300 a day, purely on the basis that they are a hundred miles up the road and I don't like to commute... Well I have decided that is someone again offers me a 9 month contact for £650 a day, I will take it. I may not like being away from home, but I like my bank balance even less! And even the lowest rate would be double my salary...\n\nIs anyone out there on the look out for a Senior .NET Developer with the skills I have listed? If so, _ping_ me (see, learning the management jargon as well) and maybe we can take it _offline_ and discuss the _space_!\n\n**How did you get into contracting?**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have been thinking a lot recently about the future of software development and where I see it going. I have worked for seven companies since leaving university (two design studios, two software studios, one community startup, one Internet bank and one investment bank), and my conclusion is that all of the SSADM (Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodologies), or Development Lifecycle, that I learned in university does not work in the real world. Yes, if you can charge your customers two million for an intranet that you will deliver over two years you can do what you like, but these days your customers business moves too quickly for this to work. A solution that was started last year, or the year before in my current company, is obsolete and has to be binned and started again. Or if the business has had its fingers in your specification from the get-go and if they have no idea what \"signed-off\" means you will get only one result; you will never finish and what you do finish will not meet the business need (80% syndrome).\n\nWith all of this in mind we need to concentrate on Software Factories and web services that will allow us to reduce the time to market and increase the happiness of our clients. To do this you need two distinct teams and an interface between them.\n\n**Why software Factories?**\n\nSoftware factories are the answer to the ever increasing need to shorten development lifecycles. You can build and test large blocks of code in preparation to building certain types of applications. If you write effective software factories that you use regularly you will be able to achieve a situation where you are 80% complete even before you start.\n\n**Why web services?**\n\nThe main reason to use web services is centralized access to data and functionality. If you build your contact management system with web services on the back end you will be able to link any other systems that require all or a part of that data. If you build your address checking system with web services then any time you need and address in any application you will be able to leverage the same tools.\n\n**Factory Development Team** (the brains)\n\nThe role of the factory team is to produce generic code packages that can be utilized by many applications to make the job of the product team easier and quicker. This can be done at the totally generic level, like the Web Service Software Factory from Microsoft, or at the specific level, for example an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm as a factory. The members of the factory team would spend a lot of their time in research and development of factory solutions and quickly integrate any new technologies into their models. The Factory team must comprise the very best, guru and above, developers to be able to get useful solutions from them and they need to be able to adapt quickly and not be upset if an entire factory has to be dropped, due to the direction the business is taking, and a new one built from scratch. For the factory team testing and stability is paramount so it will take time to get to the right level.\n\n**Product Development Team** (the brawn)\n\nThe product team concentrates on delivering effective business solutions quickly using the factories provided by the factory team. The developers on this team only need to be of average skill to be able to use the provided  frameworks effectively. The test time for solutions will be a lot quicker as the most complex code parts will have been fully tested by the factory team and it should be like using a boxed product.\n\n**Developer Evangelist** _(the nerves)_\n\nThe responsibility of the developer evangelist in this instance (although they have other roles) is to help the developers get to grips with the software factories and to take any feedback from the product team back to the to the factory team for them to incorporate into the next version of the factory. In addition to this they should make sure that any developmental production problems are communicated effectively to the factory team. This is probably the most important role, encompassing trainer, developer, diplomat and negotiator into one role for the aim of producing more value to the business, be it internal or external projects. The developer evangelist should be aware of, and be conversant in all of the new technologies to be able to alert the factory team in new factory opportunities and to train the product team in them. They should have good links with the vendor of the products to be able to prepare the entire development and management teams in the advantages that can be gained by the new features.\n\nWith this model your business will be able to effectively deliver solutions that will provide your, or your clients, business with an advantage over the competition. Yes, it takes dedication and perseverance to start this approach as it takes time to build your initial software factories. Obviously if you already have  a development team that is currently producing solutions then it will be all but impossible to change, but if you are starting out and have the freedom to construct a development team from scratch...\n",

    "BodyContent": "Well, this being my hundredth post I thought I should mention something special... Something that will change my world forever... Something that will keep me up at night...\n\nMy daughter, Evangelina Jade Hinshelwood was born yesterday (24th June 2007) at the Southern General Hospital. Her due date was the 23rd June 2007.\n\nMy wife is someone who does not seam to have contractions until the last minute, so we were happily sitting at home when her waters broke on Saturday (23rd June 2007). We waited, and we waited, but no baby. The midwifes booked us in for my wife to be induced at 8am on Sunday.\n\n**8:00am**\n\nPhoned hospital but they said that they were too busy and we will probably get seen the next day. _Ahh well, back to bed..._\n\n**9:30am**\n\nJadie wakes me up with the screams of labor. What do we do, what do we do! I got her into a bath as we both thought we had plenty of time.\n\n**9:45am**\n\nAhhhhhhh...Ahhhhhh... I think that means its hospital time. But getting my wife out of the bath, dressed and into the car, while she was having full on contractions was a trial.\n\nEvery red light was against us, so, when _safe_ to do so ( ;) ) I just ignored them.\n\n**10:30**\n\nGot to the hospital and I had to drop Jadie at the front door and park. Just as I was parking another contraction hit and all I could see in my rear view was my wife curled up on all fours in the car park.. Dumped the car. Got out to see that one of the Workmen (the hospital was having some serious renovations) was trying to help my wife up, but she had hold of his arm, and the look of pain on his face was plain to see. The other Workmen had called ahead for help, so I just rubbed my wife's back and tired to get her to breath... (I think we managed to scare the workmen as they all had the look of shock about them.)\n\nA wheel chair arrived with two midwifes, and then another with another two midwifes (what excellent service).  All the time my wife screaming, \"Get me drugs, get me drugs now...\"\n\nWe were in a room in about 2 minutes, and between contractions managed to get Jadie onto a bed.\n\n\"ohh\", said the Midwife, \"I can see the head\"....\n\n_(gory details omitted)_\n\n**11:14am**\n\n9 pound baby Evangelina was born! And very proud I was. She was a bit blue and she had a scuffed face from exiting so quickly. The midwife nicknamed her \"the missile\", but I had my baby girl. My wife managed it without any serious drugs, only Gas & air, so Eva was bright and awake when she came out. She did not even have the usual cone head look due to the speed of her delivery.\n\n[![](images/t_BABYEVA.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-6423-r_BABYEVA.jpg)\n{ .post-img }\n\nI would just like to thank the Midwifes of the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow for there fantastic efforts and exemplary service dealing with my wife, the workmen for their speedy response, and mostly my wife, for giving me such a gorgeous girl.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I know that you are not supposed to do it, but I updated my phone to [Windows Mobile 6 Black](http://wmblack.info/), specifically Black 4 (Shadow). This is a fantastic ROM and, if you are not that technical, much better than trying to cook your own! It is described as a Hybrid OEM of [HTC Hermes](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctytn.html) and [Touch](http://www.htctouch.com/) designed specifically for the Hermes. This is good as the current [HTC Touch](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctouch.html) phone does not have 3G or a keyboard, it looks fantastic though. I knew the iPhone would be good for something, pushing HTC to advance the interface!\n\nI have to say that I enjoy updating my phone. I enjoy cooking my own ROM, I just don't always have the time, so this is a grate option. You still need to know some background to be able to do this, but there is an excellent tutorial from [Mr Vanx](http://www.mrvanx.org) called [Windows Mobile 6 Black Shadow (4.0)](http://www.mrvanx.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=26), which gives you step by step advice on what to do, which as this is only the sixth or seventh update I have done, I still needed to read every line thoroughly.\n\nI can confirm that this OS update worked perfectly (for me) and I even updated my Radio to the latest version( which if you have a [SPV M3100](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly) from Orange you will know that it needs it). For those that don't know what I am talking about; this is the stage in the update process where you are most likely to \"brick\" you phone, this is a commonly used team for turning your phone into a paperweight. Which would suck...\n\nHaving performed a successful update I am happy with the result and will probably keep it at least until some other ROM catches my eye!\n\n**How have your updates gone?**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WM6](http://technorati.com/tags/WM6)\n",

First I would like to air some of my assumptions and results:\n\n- Can [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") 1.1 support this out of the box? **No!**\n- Will \"Orcas\" support this out of the box? **No!**\n- If you write a custom Portal creation wizard for TFS will Sharepoint support this? **No!**\n- Will \"Rosario\" support this out of the box? **Unknown!**\n\nTo support this as an automated process you would need to:\n\n1. Write a custom web service for Sharepoint 3.0 that uses the API to create the sub site and set it up on Sharepoint 3.0\n2. Write a custom Project Creation Wizard module that uses this web service to create the sub site.\n3. Update the process template that you use to use your module instead of the default one.\n4. Create a site for each of your existing projects and migrate all of the data.\n5. Update the Team Foundation Server application-tier SharePoint Service Registration location entry to point to the new WSS 3.0 location.\n6. Install the WSS3 update to all Team Explorers that are going to create projects.\n\n\\[If I have missed a step, let me know\\]\n\nAs a stepping stone to creating this process I have implemented an interim solution:\n\n1. Update the process template to **remove** all Sharepoint site creation.\n2. Create a site for each of your existing projects and migrate all of the data.\n3. Update the Team Foundation Server application-tier SharePoint Service Registration location entry to point to the new WSS 3.0 location.\n4. After the creation of a new TFS Project, visit the site you want the projects to appear under and manually create a site using the project name in the URL and using the TFS Sharepoint 3.0 Template.\n\nAlthough this is a manual step you need to visit the site anyway to add permissions for users. This way, all of the project portals have the same permissions as the parent site.\n\nThis works for us for a number of reasons; firstly only two users have permission to create projects; secondly we have a small total number of projects; thirdly we are not creating projects every day, not even every week. This led us to the opinion that our volume would need a major increase to require spending the time implementing the automated approach.\n\nWorks for us: Would it work for you?\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I had a plan. I wanted to create a way of accessing services in multiple locations from any location. Each location could have one or more services which may be duplications or different. That is a really abstract way of thing about it, but I eventually came up with a solution.\n\nAfter using Reflector to view the Team Foundation Server source code, which gave ma many pointers for which I would like to thank the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") Team At Microsoft, I came up with the following solution:\n\n[![image](images/Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_thumb_4-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_5.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nThis allows you to host any number of services, regardless of wither they are remote or local within a \"Server\" construct and to access that server easily. Remote and local services can exist side by side in the same server, for example you could have an ActiveDirectoryClientService hosted in a ClientServer\n\nFrom the server level (IClientServer) you can request a service based on its type or on an interface that it implements. To achieve this the IClientService interface has a property called contracts that loops through all of the interfaces that the client service object implements and pulls out only those interfaces that have the ClientServiceContractAttribute added to them. Thus you need to make sure that all of your interfaces (e.g. ITeamServer) have that attribute regardless of wither it also has a ClientServiceContractAttribute.\n\nFrom the factory level you can again request either services by type or by implementation, but this request is cross server. If you have two servers added to the factory and they both implement different contracts, you can pull any one back you like, if both servers have the same implementation you can choose wither you bring back the first or a random implementation. The potential for a load balancing solution is there but not implemented.\n\nBelow is a diagram of my TFSEventHandlerServer that included's both local and remote services. For ease of development and because it is a common thing to do I created the WcfClientServiceBase class that provides a number of features that allow less code to be written in the individual service client classes.\n\n[![image](images/Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_thumb_5-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Creatingaservicemanager_8C3D-image_6.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\nIn this example you can call any of the ClientServices with the same code:\n\nGet the server with a call:\n\n```\nDim Server As Servers.TFSEventHandlerServer\nServer = Servers.ClientServerFactory.GetServer(Of Servers.TFSEventHandlerServer)(New System.Uri(http://server:6873))\n```\n\nAnd get client services with the Subscriptions being a local service and TeamServers is a remote one.\n\n```\nDim Subscriptions As Clients.SubscriptionsService\nSubscriptions = Server.GetService(Of Clients.SubscriptionsService)()\nDim TeamServers As Clients.TeamServersService\nTeamServers = Server.GetService(Of Clients.TeamServersService)()\n```\n\nAs I hope you can see this makes it easier to implement many features with an enterprise enviroment. All you have to know is what services are available where. There is also the possibility that a lookup service could be implemented that would allow the Factory to bring you services when you do not even know here they are!\n\nI hope this helps those trying to find a way to achieve the same goals without being too restrictive. You can download the code from my [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) project.\n",

    "BodyContent": "There are a number of config options for the [TFS Event Handler Prototype](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057). I will describe all of them in depth here. The first step is to set the [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") service options, which really only requires you to change one value.\n\n```\n<system.serviceModel>         <services>             <service name=\"RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.NotificationService\">                 <endpoint address=\"http://[LocalMacheneName]:8677\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"\n                    bindingConfiguration=\"\" contract=\"RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.INotificationService\" />             </service>         </services>     </system.serviceModel>\n```\n\nThe important one is the \\[LocalMacheneName\\] variable, which should be set to the local machine name, or the domain name that points to your computer if you have a crazy proxy.\n\nThe next step is to set the real options for this software. This starts with the <[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\").TeamFoundation\\> options and requires you to set a number of things.\n\n```\n<BaseAddress url=\"http://[LocalMacheneName]:3624/\" />\n```\n\nAgain you need to set the machine name, but make sure that the port is different.\n\n```\n<TeamServers>             <TeamServer name=\"[TFS Server Name]\"\n                        url=\"http://[TFS Server Name]:8080/\"\n                        subscriber=\"[Subscriber AD Account]\"\n                        mailAddressFrom=\"[From Email Address]\"\n                        mailFromName=\"[Form name]\"\n                        mailServer=\"[email relay server]\"\n                        logEvents=\"True\"\n                        testMode=\"True\"\n                        testEmail=\"[email to send testes to]\"\n                        eventLogPath=\"C:tempTFSEventHandler\">             </TeamServer>         </TeamServers>\n```\n\nIn the Team Servers section you need to list all of the team servers that you are going to be handling events for. The system will automatically add the event subscriptions for all team servers added here, but I have only tested with two and I now always run the service on the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") server.\n\nTeamServer Options\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"577\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"138\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width=\"144\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width=\"293\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=\"141\" valign=\"top\">name</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"291\" valign=\"top\">This should be a friendly name for the team foundation server</td></tr><tr><td width=\"142\" valign=\"top\">url</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.Uri</td><td width=\"290\" valign=\"top\">The URI for the TFS server you wish to connect to including protocol and port.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"144\" valign=\"top\">mailFromAddress</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\">The address from which you want all emails sent by the system to say that they are sent.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">mailFromName</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"288\" valign=\"top\">The display name of the from&nbsp;email address</td></tr><tr><td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\">mailServer</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"287\" valign=\"top\">The mail server that you have permission for to send emails</td></tr><tr><td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\">logEvents</td><td width=\"145\" valign=\"top\">System.Boolean</td><td width=\"287\" valign=\"top\">A true or false value that enables logging of all events within that system.

Set to the name of your TFSSetup or TFSService accounts.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nNow you are ready to set the event handlers. These are defined within the \"Events\" section:\n\n> <Events\\>\n>\n> <!--\n>\n> Use one of the following events:\n>\n> AclChangedEven\n>\n> Branchmovedevent\n>\n> BuildCompletionEvent\n>\n> BuildStatusChangeEvent\n>\n> CommonStructureChangedEvent\n>\n> DataChangedEvent\n>\n> IdentityChangedEvent\n>\n> IdentityCreatedEvent\n>\n> IdentityDeletedEvent\n>\n> MembershipChangedEvent\n>\n> WorkItemChangedEvent)\n>\n> Then you need to add handlers for the events.\n>\n> Example:\n>\n> <Event eventType=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\">\n>\n> <Handlers>\n>\n> <Handler type=\"RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedToHandler\"\n>\n> assemblyFileName=\"RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedTo.dll\"\n>\n> assemblyFileLocation=\"~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking\">\n>\n> </Handler>\n>\n> </Handlers>\n>\n> </Event>\n>\n> \\-->\n>\n> <Event eventType\\=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\"\\>\n>\n> <Handlers\\>\n>\n> <Handler type\\=\"[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedToHandler\"\n>\n> assemblyFileName\\=\"[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedTo.dll\"\n>\n> assemblyFileLocation\\=\"~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking\"\\>\n>\n> </Handler\\>\n>\n> </Handlers\\>\n>\n> </Event\\>\n>\n> </Events\\>\n\nAs you can see you are theoretically allows to us any events. Please keep in mind that only the WorkItemChangedEvent and the CheckInEvent have been tested. When you add the \"Event\" tag with the corresponding eventType (which is an enumerator) this tells the system which specific events to subscribe to.\n\nYou can then add handlers to an event. These handlers are fired whenever these events are received.\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"571\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"90\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width=\"277\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width=\"202\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=\"93\" valign=\"top\">eventType</td><td width=\"279\" valign=\"top\"><a title=\"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\" href=\"http://www.rddotnet.com\" target=\"_blank\">RDdotNet</a>.TeamFoundation.EventTypes</td><td width=\"199\" valign=\"top\">Enumerator that&nbsp; defines the list of possible events.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"95\" valign=\"top\">type</td><td width=\"281\" valign=\"top\">System.Type</td><td width=\"197\" valign=\"top\">This must be a valid type in the assembly listed in assemblyFileName</td></tr><tr><td width=\"96\" valign=\"top\">assemblyFileName</td><td width=\"282\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"196\" valign=\"top\">This must be a valid assembly found in the assemblyFileLocation</td></tr><tr><td width=\"96\" valign=\"top\">assemblyFileLocation</td><td width=\"282\" valign=\"top\">System.String</td><td width=\"196\" valign=\"top\">A location within the servers file system that holds this assembly. ~ denotes the applications root.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nIf you are using friendly server names or TeamPlain the you can change the  TFS server links to be TeamPlain ones using the UrlReplacements config element:\n\n> ```\n> <UrlReplacements>             <!-- The Url Replaces change the url listed in the event to valid public items             Examples:                 This item changes the TFS url to a TeamPlain v1 url                 <Replace eventType=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\" old=\":8080/WorkItemTracking/WorkItem.aspx?artifactMoniker=\" new=\"/workitem.aspx?id=\" />                                              These items change the server location to a public host header:                 <Replace eventType=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\" old=\"[ServerProductionEnviromentName]\" new=\"[PublicProductionEnviromentUri]\" />                 <Replace eventType=\"WorkItemChangedEvent\" old=\"[ServerDevelopmentEnviromentName]\" new=\"[PublicDevelopmentEnviromentUri]\" />             -->\n> ```\n>\n> ```\n> </UrlReplacements>\n> ```\n\nThis works by replacing values within the URL in the events. You specify the event type, what to look for and what to replace it by. This allows grater control and the integration of TeamPlain into your world. If a task is assigned to someone outside of your departmental sphere who you have given permission to TFS but who know nothing about it, they will still get an email that will link them through to TeamPlain.\n\nAnd that is you all set. if you have installed the service and set the account that is used to run the service you should get no errors when starting. No guarantees though :)\n",

    "BodyContent": "Creating an event handler with the [Team Foundation Server Event Handlers](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/) is very easy. You will need to inherit from the AEventHandler class which is part of [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\").TeamFoundation.dll located in the install directory (I will make an SDK later).\n\n[![image](images/CreatingyourownEventHandler_DC01-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingyourownEventHandler_DC01-image.png)\n{ .post-img }\n\n```\nImports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client\n\nPublic MustInherit Class AEventHandler(Of TEvent)\n\n    Public MustOverride Sub Run(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of TEvent), _                                 ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of TEvent))\n    Public MustOverride Function IsValid(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of TEvent), _                                         ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                         ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                         ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of TEvent)) As Boolean  End Class\n```\n\nBoth of the methods that the AEventHandler exposes have the same signature. Hear is what it all means...\n\n<table width=\"666\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" unselectable=\"on\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"139\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Name</strong></td><td width=\"196\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Type</strong></td><td width=\"329\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=\"139\" valign=\"top\">EventHandlerItem</td><td width=\"193\" valign=\"top\">EventHandlerItem(<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Of</span> TEvent)</td><td width=\"334\" valign=\"top\">The event handler item contains information about the handler.

The IsValid method denotes wither the handler will acrualy run at all:\n\n```\n    Public Overrides Function IsValid(ByVal EventHandlerItem As EventHandlerItem(Of WorkItemChangedEvent), _                                      ByVal ServiceHost As ServiceHostItem, _                                      ByVal TeamServer As TeamServerItem, _                                      ByVal e As NotifyEventArgs(Of WorkItemChangedEvent)) As Boolean         If e.Event Is Nothing Then             Return False         End If         Dim assignedName As String = WorkItemEventQuerys.GetAssignedToName(e.Event)\n        If String.IsNullOrEmpty(assignedName) Then             Return False         Else             Return Not assignedName = WorkItemEventQuerys.GetChangedByName(e.Event)\n        End If     End Function\n```\n\nThis method initially checks to see if the event exists and then queries the assigned name from the event using a work item event query which consists of:\n\n```\nReturn eventData.CoreFields.StringFields.Find(New Predicate(Of StringField)(AddressOf FindAssignedTo)).NewValue\n```\n\nAll this does is search the String fields associated with the core work item bits to find the \"System.AssignedTo\" value. You could so this manually, but I have a number of queries there and you can add any number you wish.\n\nThe logic: If Event exists and assigned name is not empty then check that the assigned name is not the changed name.\n\nSo in English with all of the crap split out: Did the user assign the work item to himself? If not then send them an email!\n\nThe rest, as they say, is just logic. The \"Run\" method calls the \"IsValid\" and then sends an email if it is in fact valid, hardly rocket science.\n\nHopefully with this knowledge you will be able to make many many event handlers!\n\n_For the delayed CTP 1 of the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/) I have changed the logic quite a lot but the same IsValid and Run methods exist. The parameters are, however slightly different. I have taken into account security and you will have to make your own connection to the TFS server using your own username and password. I have changed this to protect the security of the application as I want developers to be able to upload event handler assemblies and WF workflow without having to get access to the server. I ahve also changed it so the service that captures the events is not the same one that runs the handlers. This allows me to send the events between these services using MSMQ, thus giving the service some much needed redundancy._\n",

I have, however made a number of enhancements of the surrounding framework that will allow the smother function of this and other releases.\n\nCurrently I have completed:\n\n- [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\") Server Factory - this set of classes and interfaces allows the management, connection and creation of multiple services (both local and remote) even if they are in multiple physical locations.\n- [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\") TFS Event Handler Queuer - this architecture captures all of the events from a particular team server and feeds those events onto a MSMQ [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") service that enables the processing service to be restarted without loosing any events.\n- [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\") TFS Event Manager - this is a tree based structure for managing your servers and uploaded event handlers.\n- [RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com \"RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET\") Services Framework - a quick method of creating [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") services that does most of the work for you. This in purely for programmatic implementations as, obviously, the config route is the easiest, but does not fit every bill!\n\nWhat I have not yet completed:\n\n- Getting it all working together :)\n- An effective way of managing the TFS Subscriptions\n- Testing and debugging the whole thing.\n\nI do have an implementation of the event handler idea that requires hard coded implementation of assemblies. This works, but has no redundancy and is not robust. I have been using it for a couple of months with no problems. I will try to package this up for you guys when I get a moment - unless I have to rush to the hospital, in which case, tough!\n\n_note:_\n\n_If I get into work tomorrow I will try my best to upload the installer for the current Alfa version. It is slightly configurable with Event Handlers listed in a config file. Not what I am trying to achieve and you have to restart the service manually when you add a event handler. Oh, and this MUST be installed on the team server and you need to enter a TFS Server Administrator password into the config file. I will call this the \"TFS Rubbishy manual Event Handler\", and it **will** need some installation instructions..._\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT)\n",

After consulting with blogs, forums and Microsoft the end result is that it will not work in an automated way. You can't create a sub site to and existing site with Sharepoint without customizing the Sharepoint site creation process, which I am not going to get into at the moment. Maybe later. The best I can hope for at this time is to disable the creation of the Sharepoint site during the project creation process and to create the site manually after the project has been created. Although this adds a manual step to the process this is not a problem for us as there are only 2 users allowed to create new projects in our environment.\n\nExtending the project creation wizard may not be that hard! I have only looked at the [examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Extensibility_Guided_Tour/Extending%20Project%20Creation.asp), but it looks doable.  Just don't have the time at the moment as I am trying to concentrate on the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler).\n\nI will just have to add it to my [Wish list of TFS Tools](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/06/My-Wish-List-of-Team-Foundation-Server-Tools.aspx)...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SP 2007](http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007)\n",

You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.  \n**You like coding at a Low level.**  \nYou're from the old school of programming and believe that you should have an intimate relationship with the computer. You don't mind juggling registers around and spending hours getting a 5% performance increase in an algorithm.  \n**You work best in a Team.**  \nA good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.  \n**You are a liBeral programmer.**  \nProgramming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task.

Like me you will probably not really rate these devices as phones, but it beats carrying multiple technobits in your pocket. You can use it for pictures, email, mp3 (until the [Zune](http://www.zune.net \"Zune MP3 player\") is released in the UK), reading books (using MS Reader), browsing the web (its not a bad as you would think), and many other things that you require extra software for. What many users of these devices do not know is that Orange does not actually make these phones, it is a company called HTC and they make around 90% of the Smartphones and Pocket PC mobiles. Everyone will have seen the new iPhone that Mac are producing, and although nice to look at, it has a horrendous price tag and you cant get any software for it. Does that remind you of anything, hmmm, any Mac product maybe?\n\nWell HTC has come up with a first step competitor for the iPhone, and they call it the [HTC Touch](http://www.htctouch.com/ \"HTC Touch\"). After viewing the promo website I will definitely be looking for that in my next phone.\n\nMy only question is: **When will this be available on orange?**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [WM6](http://technorati.com/tags/WM6) [Answers](http://technorati.com/tags/Answers)\n",

I am trying to interrogate the Team Foundation Server work item store to find all the required fields only and just display those, but I think it will need some sort of configuration utility to specify what fields are available for which projects over and above the default set.

His answer? _Try it and see._ So I did.\n\nI updated the dev server with the details I provided in my previous post and Manually created Sites under that http://server:888/Projects site with the same name as the project. I tested this by both clicking \"Show Project Portal\" and creating a new document library in a project. These two features worked a treat.\n\nThis allows us to seamlessly integrate TFS with our intranet, and have a decent project portal for things like TFS Global reports and links to TeamPlain among other things.\n\nThe real test will come once I get my hands on the Hotfix detailed in KB article #932544 (watch out for the [gotcha](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1658067&SiteID=1 \"Configuring TFS with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0\")) and I can try creating projects on the new server and in the new location. If this does not work, I will probably have the projects created in WSS 2.0 and manually create projects in WSS 3.0. This will be a minor inconvenience as only two people have permission to create projects.\n\nHopefully it will work...\n\n_Something to check will be the permissions that are setup!

    "BodyContent": "If you want to create a [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\") Service Host on the fly then you will need to first create a base address. I would recommend using the DNS host entry instead of the My.Computer.Name as I had many problems on the corporate network with \\[computername\\] not working with our proxy settings.\n\n```\nDim baseAddresses() As Uri = {New Uri(String.Format(\"http://{0}:{1}/TFSEventHandler/Queuer\", System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName).HostName, Port))}\n```\n\nThen you need to create the service host itself.\n\n```\nDim sh As New System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost(GetType(Services.QueuerService), baseAddresses)\n```\n\nThen set the service meta and debug behaviors so that you can both enable the MEX and remote exception handling.\n\n```\n' Set service meta behavior\nDim smb As ServiceMetadataBehavior = sh.Description.Behaviors.Find(Of ServiceMetadataBehavior)()\nIf smb Is Nothing Then\n  smb = New ServiceMetadataBehavior()\n  smb.HttpGetEnabled = True\n  sh.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb)\nElse\n  smb.HttpGetEnabled = True\nEnd If\n' Set Service Debug Behavior\nDim sdb As ServiceDebugBehavior = sh.Description.Behaviors.Find(Of ServiceDebugBehavior)()\nIf sdb Is Nothing Then\n  sdb = New ServiceDebugBehavior()\n  sdb.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults = True\n  sh.Description.Behaviors.Add(sdb)\nElse\n  sdb.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults = True\nEnd If\n```\n\nThen comes the easy bit, adding the Endpoints. I have chosen to use a Secure wsHttpBinding as I am using Active Directory authentication and I want another level of security. Here I am creating a number of static end points, but also an endpoint for each of the Team Foundation Server SOAP Events, which uses the same code to handle each one, but you can determine the incoming URL for the event type.\n\n```\nsh.Description.Endpoints.Clear()\nFor Each EventType As Events.EventTypes In [Enum].GetValues(GetType(Events.EventTypes))\n    sh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.INotification), GetSecureWSHttpBinding, \"Notification/\" & EventType.ToString)\nNext\nsh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions), GetSecureWSDualHttpBinding, \"Subscriptions\")\nsh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Services.Contracts.ITeamServers), GetSecureWSDualHttpBinding, \"TeamServers\")\nsh.AddServiceEndpoint(GetType(Description.IMetadataExchange), GetSecureWSHttpBinding, \"mex\")\n```\n\nYou will need to create the binding programmatically as well (see the GetSecureDualWSHttpBinding method referenced above) and you may need to set some specialist options. I needed to increase the size of some of the payloads to implement my service. I have chosen to use the same method to create the service on both the client and the server so I have included the ClientBaseAddress property to get around the problem on Windows of a \"http://+:80 error if you have IIS installed.\n\n```\nDim Binding As New WSDualHttpBinding(WSDualHttpSecurityMode.Message)\nBinding.MaxReceivedMessageSize = 655360\nBinding.ReaderQuotas.MaxStringContentLength = 655360\nBinding.ReaderQuotas.MaxArrayLength = 655360\nBinding.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType = MessageCredentialType.Windows\nBinding.Security.Message.NegotiateServiceCredential = True\nBinding.ClientBaseAddress = New System.Uri(\"http://\" & System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName).HostName & \":660\")\nBinding.BypassProxyOnLocal = True\n```\n\nUsing this in conjunction with the custom proxy creation will allow you to build versatile integrated services on the .NET platform.\n\nYou can find all of the code listed above @ [http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler)\n",

This means that you always have to write convertors or adapters to convert one object type to another even though they are the same object (only core class and proxy of that class).\n\nI decided to solve the problem by creating custom proxies for my Windows Communication Foundation services. What you need to do is add a reference to your DataContract and ServceContract assemblies and do the following:\n\n> Friend Class SubscriptionsClient  \n>       Inherits System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase(Of Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions)  \n>       Implements Services.Contracts.ISubscriptions\n>\n> ...\n>\n> End Class\n\nThis way you have no need of a convertors or adapters between object types. Obviously this only works for .NET to .NET implementations of servers, you Java guys are still on your own, but it a usefully tool to add to your arsenal.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [SOA](http://technorati.com/tags/SOA) [WCF](http://technorati.com/tags/WCF)\n",

I have to say, that I have had none of these problems and I use both a locally hosted team server and [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") hosted projects. I do have some users in the office who have a very slow connection to [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\"), but they are on a remote network and use a 2mb link to the main network, so I am not surprised by this.\n\nIf you are having problems with the speed or responsiveness of your team server there are a couple of things you can try!\n\nPing: do a \"ping -n 20\" from the command line to see if there are any problems connecting to your server over a longer time than 4 pings. On a local network you should get an average of 0 to 1 ms ping time with a max of 4-8 ms depending on the size of your network. If you are getting more than this you need to check with your infrastructure team and see if there is something they can do..\n\nServer Spec: I think that I am spoiled as my server speck is a lot more than the min for [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\"). This was not deliberate, but the minimum spec I can get from my company for a dedicated server is dual xeon processors and 8gb of RAM. The RAM is way above spec but this helps when many people hit the team server at the same time, and I have a dual server installation with the same spec on both servers.\n\nI can only guess what the [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") servers spec's are, but I am sure that they are beefy.\n\nIf you have a slow team server, check the network and then check the performance spec's on your server and see where the bottle neck is...\n\n**Do you have a slow team server?**\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM)\n",

This would be similar to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") but with much more control given to the project owners... i.e. custom Process templates, full work item suite and full customisation capabilities.\n\nOn 5/18/07 10:44 PM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  \nI think that we would be talking about a server per customer.

This will have an apeal to small and medium companies and those that do not have any development resource and wish to use team server to manage non-development projects.\n\nOn 5/20/07 12:27 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  \nI will need to look into the idea of Single-Sign-on, but I am dubious about its achievability. I think that the best we can hope for is a web interface that is single sign on but still require additional AD authentication for Source Control. I know that this is not what you want to hear, but [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") requires all users to be in the same domain...  \nAnd I don't think that you want to expose your domain to a third party company!\n\nOn 5/20/07 12:31 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  \nTo address latency, I think we would need to use a services like RackSpace, which, although expensive, provides very high connection speeds and low latency. The problem would be the expence!  \nHave you used [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\")? This service is fast, I have been using it at home and work to manage a number of solutions that I work on and I do not find the speed a problem...\n\nOn 5/20/07 12:33 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  \nExternal access on [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") does not require VPN, which would slow it down. It is designed to be made availale over SSL using AD authentication.\n\nYou can view the answers that prompted the clarifications from LinkedIn question [Would anyone be interested in hosted Visual Studio Team System](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/46649-1363184)\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [TFBS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFBS) [TFS Admin](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Admin) [Version Control](http://technorati.com/tags/Version+Control) [Design](http://technorati.com/tags/Design) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT) [Developing](http://technorati.com/tags/Developing) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

I had never done them before as I would have had to pay for them myself. Which sucks...\n\nThe company I am now working for (the first to have more than 30 employees, and has more than 70,000) has kindly decided that I get a training budget. Now, though the budget is large, it would only cover one and a half of the exam courses per year and I can't be bothered to take 4 years to do it, by which time they will be obsolete anyway, so I have decided to go for the self study approach.\n\nI am studying for my [Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/) of the [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) flavor.

First is exam 70-536, the problem is that I have been doing .NET development for 6 years and .NET 2.0 for 2 of those. This means that 80% of things I know already which makes the books rather boring!\n\nAh well, back to the book!\n\n_An excelent resource for 71-510 can be found on the dotnetfun site @ [Prepare for the 70-536 Certification Exam: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation](http://www.dotnetfun.com/articles/certifications/Passing70536Certification.aspx)._\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal) [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

Envisioners tend to have job titles like \"Developer Evangelist\", \"Technical Evangelist\" or \"Architect Evangelist\".

They take their time learning new technologies and do not like using anything first. They are usually very good at delivering working solutions, but not necessarily meeting all the requirements, when the requirements don't fit the technology.\n\nFor a project you probably need at least on Envisioner and one to many provisioners, but not an envisioner on their own.

I have changed it so that instead of one big solution I will have three smaller ones. This will allow me to cross reference the different services.\n\nEssentially the Team Server fires events that a service (TFSEventQueuer) captures and adds them, with a little jiggery porkery, to a message queue. The second service (TFSEventHandlers) reads the Queue and executes the appropriate handlers.\n\nThis should be pretty neat once it is complete, and the interface should allow users to easily administer the handlers.\n\nStill a long way to go...

    "BodyContent": "Will, not really...\n\nI work for a rather large organization and I wanted an easy way for power users of team system to deploy event handlers for the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") events. Essentially they create an assembly with as many EventHandler classes as they like and they can upload their assembly through an administration system, which in turn executes any handlers that exist on the system for any events.\n\nThe Event Handler class format:\n\n> <EventHandler(EventType:=EventTypes.WorkItemChangedEvent, LogEmail:=[someone@company.com](mailto:someone@company.com))>\\_\n>\n> <Logging(Enable:=True, Verbose:=True) \\_\n>\n> Public Class MyEventHandler\n>\n> Inherits AEventHandler(of WorkItemChangedEvent)\n>\n> Public Sub Run(TeamServer as TeamFoundation Server, e as EventHandlerArgs(of WorkItemChangedEvent))\n>\n> ' Run any code for the event\n>\n> End Sub\n>\n> Public Sub IsValid(TeamServer as TeamFoundation Server, e as EventHandlerArgs(of WorkItemChangedEvent))\n>\n> ' Check validity of the event\n>\n> End Sub\n>\n> End Class\n>\n> Public Class EventHandlerArgs(Of TEvent as {ATfsEvent})\n>\n> ...\n>\n> ' This is the type of event that is being created as an enumerator\n>\n> Public Readonly Property EventType as EventTypes\n>\n> ...\n>\n> ' This is the actual body of the event as a WorkItemChangedEvent or CheckInEvent etc..\n>\n> Public Readonly Property \\[Event\\] as TEvent\n>\n> ...\n>\n> ' This holds the URL of the [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") server that the event originated from\n>\n> Public Readonly Property Identity as TfsIdentity\n>\n> ...\n>\n> ' The subscription info shows information about the subscription options\n>\n> Public Readonly Property SubscriptionInfo as SubscritpionInfo\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Public Sub New(ByVal EventType as EventTypes, ByVal \\[Event\\] as TEvent, ByVal Identity as TfsIdentity, ByVal SubscriptionInfo as SubscritpionInfo)\n>\n> ...\n>\n> End Class\n\nThere is then a system that handles all of the events and is subscribed through the Bizsubscribe tool, but that allows a user to administer their own EventHandler's through and admin system (Web, Form or XBAP) through a bunch of web services. There is a lot of code, and not enough room to put it up here, I may start a [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com \"CodePlex\") project. I will be adding the admin system for this to our TeamPlain site and I may set it up to deploy as such. I will also require to create a visual studio project template thingy.\n\nI am afraid I had to code from memory, so any errors or omissions are just my a sign of me getting old, but I hope you get the point and the ease with which you could write and deploy EventHandler's with this.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [TFS Custom](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+Custom) [WIT](http://technorati.com/tags/WIT)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I have found that there is very little content available on the art of selling Team System for developers that want to use it. Developers need to sell it not only to their manager, but to a hole host of people, and it is no small expense to implement it.\n\nThere needs to be some sort of content available to help sell this product, and I mean without trawling through hundreds of MSDN pages, case studies and blogs. Lets face it, if you tell someone a piece of software is good and give them some content, what is the likelihood that they will read it... Zip, that how likely it is.\n\nThe fact is that you not only need to sell this to your management, you need to get every member of the program teams to buy into it as well. This includes Developers, Business Analysts, Project Manager, Testers and Managers, and this is not easy.\n\nYou need an angle for each of these groups and you need to be able talk to each of their needs and concerns. It is a full time job trying to sell Team System to your team. On the upside, if you convince the teams the managers will follow, if only to shut everyone up. I would suggest getting a trial copy of [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") setup under the auspicious title of \"Proof-Of-Concept\" that will allow you to demo the product. And remember if you go down this root, [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") will be your life: Selling, Deployment, Configuration and Customization... It is never ending.\n\nMy advice is to start small, deploy team server and get it working for you and a few select others. Then get the project managers on board and wow them with reports, even if you have to update [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx \"Team Foundation Server\") yourself and keep it in line with their excel lists of bugs, tasks, risks and issues.\n\nForget getting Team Suit or even Team Editions, at £7000 and £2500 respectively these costs are just to prohibitive, you will have enough on your plate getting £2200 per server and £300 per CAL off your budget.\n\nAnd Remember: _If you build it, they will come._\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFS)\n",

Specifically \"CardSpace\" and its use and benefits. A number of other delegates also had concerns which I also shared. Mike managed to answer them effectively for me, I am not sure about the others, and I can see the use of CardSpace as a single sign on solution that does not require a username or password.\n\nMike seams to have a thing for Windows Workflow Foundation as he got carried away with that part of the session and had to skip most of [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\"). I totally agree with him that WF is an excellent piece of work and fills a niche that prior to WF us developers needed to either code ourselves or pay exorbitant costs for a third party product.\n\nAlthough I had heard about 60% of the session before, it was well worth while as there were many bits that helped the rest fall into place...\n\nI was especially interested in a class property manager thingy that is used in workflow. I did not get a chance to enquire of Mike if this can be used by developers independently of WF, but I can see many of the advantages of using it.\n\nMike, if you are listening, and can decipher my cryptic description, can you answer this?\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [Personal](http://technorati.com/tags/Personal)\n",

Well as team server does not support compartmentalization of projects out of the box the long project names must stay.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n> <script type=\"text/JavaScript\">\n> \n> function Remove(ProjectString,ThingToRemove)  \n> {  \n> if (ProjectString.indexOf(ThingToRemove) == 0)  \n> {  \n> ProjectString = ProjectString.replace(ThingToRemove, '');  \n> }  \n> return ProjectString  \n> }\n> \n> var mylist=document.getElementById(\"ph1\\_cmbProjects\");  \n> for (i=0;i<=mylist.length-1;i++)  \n> {  \n> mylist.options\\[i\\].text = Remove(mylist.options\\[i\\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-BusinessUnit1-')  \n> mylist.options\\[i\\].text = Remove(mylist.options\\[i\\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-BusinessUnit2-')  \n> mylist.options\\[i\\].text = Remove(mylist.options\\[i\\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area2-Dept1-')  \n> mylist.options\\[i\\].text = Remove(mylist.options\\[i\\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area1-PP-')  \n> mylist.options\\[i\\].text = Remove(mylist.options\\[i\\].text,'XXEMEA-UK-Area1-TFS-')  \n> }\n> \n> </script>\n\nPut it after the drop down list by the id of \"cmbProjects\" and change the remove function calls for whatever you need.\n\nI know it is ugly, but it is the sort of \"Tactical\" work around that gets the short term problem sorted.\n\nI permanent solution would be nested projects (Or and Organizational Unit separator for the project name) from Microsoft, but I don't think it is on the cards in the near future!\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM)\n",

Even though users have no permissions for a particular project: I am thinking that removing \"Team Foundation Valid Users\" from the project will work, I just have not had time to test it...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [VS 2005](http://technorati.com/tags/VS+2005)\n",

Needless to say, he had a few problems, as everyone does when installing TFS. So he gave me a call and I road to the resque.\n\nThe big advantage of installing TFS in a amall comapany, is that you can OWN the entire server. He gave me teh admin password and I had TFS eating out of my hand in about 20 minutes.\n\nNeil had managed to get TFS working in an imresive mear 2 days, and that is not being sarcastic. It took me 5 days in an enterprise enviroment...\n\nThere were a couple of permission issues, but that got sorted in quick order.\n\nNeil then broke the bad news to me...One of his developers had moved to Spain and still need access! Sh1t...\n\nTune in next week to see how I got on with external SSL!\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM)\n",

    "BodyContent": "I was asked on LinkedIn:\n\n> \"Are you planning to adopt .NET 3.0 in H1 2007?\n>\n> Several clients have asked me if their existing web systems can be upgraded to .NET 3.0. After some investigation, it seems that much of .NET 3.0 is available in other forms. For example, Windows Workflow looks like Biztalk in new clothes while Windows Communication Foundation does not improve on the performance of existing Web Services (though could be useful when setting up new ones). Windows Presentation Foundation/E is still only in CTP form and may require the end user to install a plugin (which removes the main advantage it may have over Flex 2/Flash 9) while I still don't see the USP for Cardspace.  \n> Are your companies using .NET 3.0 purely for new applications?  \n> Is it being used in place of other comparable technologies (e.g. Biztalk)? If so, how does .NET 3.0 compare?  \n> Have you found .NET 3.0's XML-based approach simpler to use?  \n> I am personally waiting for the official .NET 3.0 (Visual Studio \"Orcas\" + C# 3.0 including LINQ) release later this year before recommending .NET 3.0-based systems.\"\n>\n> By [Franco Milazzo](http://www.linkedin.com/in/eyetie)\n\nI answered:\n\nMy company is using .NET 3.0, where appropriate for new applications. We even have Microsoft’s Evangelists doing weekly presentations on WPF, [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com \"Windows Communication Foundation\"), and WF to get all of the developers and IT management up to speed.  \nWe have around 20,000+ IT staff and need to do this as quickly as possible as we are rolling out Vista and Office 2007 to 75,000 employees this year. As Vista has .NET 3.0 built-in, there is not even a support issue.\n\nWF is not Biztalk, it will not replace Biztalk, nor will it have comparable features. However the next version of Biztalk will use WF as its internal orchestration engine as will many of Microsoft’s future products.  \nWF requires coding and integration work while Biztalk provides a much larger package that has masses of automation that is not provided in WF.\n\nWPF/e is essentially Microsoft’s replacement for Flash. WPF/e has a number of advantages over Flash the main one being integration; Flash sucks at communicating with other platforms, such as .NET or Java, while WPF/e uses native .NET thus providing the functionality of this platform in the animation environment; no more (non) action script.\n\nCardSpace provides something that has never been available for all internet sites before. Single sign on! Yes, it has been available in various proprietary and expensive forms before. CardSpace allows the users to manage their identify themselves and to control what information is used by sites. It use open source xml to be platform independent and I believe there is already a Linux version along with Firefox support. Its mainstream use will be dependant on developer uptake and not users, so it will probably have a slow market penetration.\n\nThere is no reason why you should not use .NET 3.0 on new projects. The only reason to upgrade .NET 2.0 projects would be to simplify support and increase flexibility if you are using web services, remoting, message queuing, workflow or single-sign-on. Upgrading to .NET 3.0 is not really the way to think about it as you are still using the .NET 2.0 runtime. When ‘Orcas’ is released so will .NET 3.5 which will bring a new version of the CLR as well. This will not be the same product and even Vista will need updating to support it!\n\nGo with .NET 3.0!\n\nI also sugested an expert:\n\n[Daniel Moth](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/ \"The Moth\")\n\nTechnorati Tags: [.NET](http://technorati.com/tags/.NET) [WPF](http://technorati.com/tags/WPF)\n",

WMDC is the replacement for ActiveSync on Vista and I would have expected it to be available for the business release of Vista. Up until now users have had to make do with the beta version that was originally released for Vista RC1, and I can tell you it was a little flaky in places. Not anything really problematic, just the usual beta unfinishedness, though it was usable.\n\nI was very happy to get my Windows Alert this morning from [Daniel Moth's](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/02/wmdc-rtm.html \"Windows Mobile Device Center\") blog to say that it was released and it was a painless procedure to get rid of the beta and install the RTM.\n\nHave fun...

After that last elongated post I am in the mood to write again...\n\nOur TFS implementation is moving forward. I did a presentation on Friday to my peers and  bosses on the need for TFS and the appropriate uses of it. This has all come about as the scope of the project I have been asked to undertake has increased. Instead of 6 developers an 4 project managers, I have been asked to spec for 10 developers and 20 other users. This requires the sourcing of desktops for all as not only do the current computers not have corporate builds (my company buys the windows source and does strange things with it) but the 20 users have thin clients, which will not support Office 2003 (physically yes, but our infrastructure requires Office 2000). More cost..\n\nI will also have to put in a dev environment and a disaster recovery environment, more cost, and get servers hosted in our datacenters. All in, not including the desktops (which we need anyway to comply with corporate policy) the current implementation of TFS will cost around £100,000 ($200,000). Thus, rightly so, I have higher-uppers questioning the cost and need for the system.\n\nThe result is that for a company of our size, 75,000 est., with over 5,000 developers alone, I do not think that we can operate effectively in the cut throat world of investment banking without the advantages that TFS will provide.\n\nSure, we can calculate the metrics yourself, but we will miss things.\n\nSure, we can have each team build website   wiki's to manage their content so other developers can see what is going on, but with that many developers how will we keep track.\n\nSure, we can implement some sort of open source source control system (Subversion or ClearCase), but will we really be able to see all the code, or incorporate local and global changes?\n\nI think not.\n\nIt would be far better to have a complete solution that covers all aspects of the development life cycle, instead of having piecemeal system knitted together by a variety of technologies.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [SOA](http://technorati.com/tags/SOA) [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [TFBS](http://technorati.com/tags/TFBS)\n",

The only way to get things working is to keep your head down until you have a viable solution, otherwise you get blown out of the water as soon as department z resizes that you product my do away with their solution for one part of of a larger system. Sillyness...\n\nThe only way to get ahead in this industry is to get the software out of the door more quickly than the competition. Last year, our company made billions because they worked out a way to get the data to the traders 600 milliseconds faster than the competition! Now, this is an extreme example, but it highlights the speed of the industry.\n\nIn the sector that I work in, mortgages, the winner is the one who can sell the most mortgages and securitize more often. That means that the information available to the management the collection of the original data, needs to be up-to-date, correct and comprehensive.\n\nTo do this we need to industrialize our activities. This means that we need solid reuse of components that have already been tested and stabilized. We need those components to be able to be used on \"the factory floor\" to produce highly scalable application quickly.\n\nTeam Foundation Server can provide this. I am not saying that it will provide this to everyone, just as a production line does not make every factory successful. But the facility is now there to provide an infrastructure to working collaboratively on IT projects that Outlook just does not mat\n\nJust as there was an industrial revolution over the steam engine in the early 19th centaury and one in the 1920's witchery Fords production line, Team Foundation Server will push IT into a revolution of its own...\n\nTechnorati Tags: [ALM](http://technorati.com/tags/ALM) [Fail](http://technorati.com/tags/Fail)\n",

    "BodyContent": "There are a number of challenges to overcome when developing a new business. One of the hardest to get right is your web presence. I have been involved with [Scottish Enterprise](http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/) before and recently got a question from my sister-in-law who has a new job over at [Islington Enterprise](http://www.islingtonenterprise.co.uk/), and questions are always asked about Websites, SEO, DNS, Blogs, Accessibility and other things that most Internet users just do not understand. The may appreciate the results, but they do not understand the complexities of producing it. I will answer a few questions here for all to see...\n\n# What is SEO?\n\nWell [Search Engine Optimisation](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) ([SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)) is the black art of improving your ranking on search engines. It is well known that users of search engines very rarely get passed the first 10 results (first page) if a search, at most they will look at the first 20 results.\n\nSEO uses key-words and descriptions in [meta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_tags \"Meta element\") tags as well as key word density in the copy. The copy will need tweaked on a decreasingly regular basis as the desired results are achieved. I good SEO specialist may also be conversant in [NLP](https://inlpcenter.org/what-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp/ \"Neuro-linguistic programming\") ([Neuro-linguistic programming](https://inlpcenter.org/what-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp/)) giving your site an edge once users actually get to read the copy.\n\nSEO is highly complex, and requires many experts. There are a good number of company's out there that can provide decent SEO services, but few who are true experts as it is more of a art than a science.\n\nContact: [Iain Frame](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/ \"Iain Frame\") @ [If Only Design](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/) | [Greg Fyans](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Greg Fyans\") @ [Black Red](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Web Developer\")\n\n# What is DNS?\n\n[DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system \"Domain name system\") ([Domain name system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system)) is quite complicated in detail, but simple in concept. Essentially all computers, websites and devices on the Internet are referenced by [IP addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) (e.g. 192.168.0.1), but these IP addresses are not user friendly. Imagine having to type in 64.233.183.99 every time you wanted to go to Google. Thus DNS was born. When you type [www.google.co.uk](http://www.google.co.uk) your computer looks up the address on a DNS server and translates it into the IP address. Simple...\n\nRecommendation: [DynDNS](http://www.dyndns.com/)\n\n# Why would I want a blog?\n\nBlogs drive traffic plane and simple. Even if it is a developer working for you that blogs, it gets additional visibility to your site and reassures customers and partner that you are reputable and capable. But be warned, savvy blog readers can spot a fake 50 pixels away...\n\n# Who do I need to build my site?\n\nYou need a number of people. I will give some examples and contact suggestions for those that are looking for a website for their business or intending to improve their existing website for the benefit of their bottom line. The suggestions I make may not be the cheapest, but they will be the best to my knowledge..\n\n## Designer\n\nYou will need a professionally designed site. It is no longer good enough to do one yourself or to skimp on the design. If you do so you will loose credibility with a majority of your customers and be dismissed immediately by many more.\n\nContact: [Iain Frame](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/ \"Iain Frame\") @ [If Only Design](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/)\n\n## Web Developer\n\nA professionally developed site will contain many things that are not apparent to the user. Accessibility: This is one of the most important part of your site. It ranges from a blind person using a \"reader\" to someone with [myopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia) or [glaucoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma) visiting your site. Do you really want to reject their custom just because they have poor eye site. A good web developer can provide you anything from plane [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) to dynamic content to full [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system \"Content management system\") ([Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)).\n\nContact: [Greg Fyans](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Greg Fyans\") @ [Black Red](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Web Developer\")\n\nRecommendations: [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ \"ASP.NET\") - Due to its quick time to market and the abundance of help available.\n\n## Copywriter SEO Specialist\n\nSee SEO above!\n\nContact: [Iain Frame](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/ \"Iain Frame\") @ [If Only Design](http://www.ifonlydesign.co.uk/) | [Greg Fyans](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Greg Fyans\") @ [Black Red](http://www.blackred.co.uk/ \"Web Developer\")\n\n## Hosting Company\n\nHosting companies are hard. They all end up being rubbish in the end: IMO. Only a few stand out, Rackspace, Serverbeach and a few others, but they are expensive! Your best bet is to shop around and find the cheapest and the most expensive and take and average. Somewhere around £40-£50 per month should suffice for the start. Expect to pay £200-£400 per month for dedicated hosting once you get a lot of hits.\n\nRecommended: None | take the advice of your designer or developer.\n\n# Costs\n\nExpect to pay a LOT for a good web solution. Remember this will become one of your major revenue streams. The company I work for takes around £3 billion a year, 70% of which is through their website. Good SEO can increase these percentages.\n\nYou can look up any of the bits on wikipedia.org to find out more details, linked above. The cost of building a website is tiny compared to the revenues generated as a consequence of having one, but without any details about the target business I can’t say what it will cost. I can estimate though:\n\n- Basic website (design & html only) - £5,000 one off with £40 per month\n- Dynamic website with contact forms / news / blogs (£10,000+ one off with £40 per month)\n- Content managed website with all the trimmings (£50,000+ one off and £400 per month)\n\n# Troubleshoot InfoBites\n\n- Get a professionally made site.\n- If you are getting a website for under £1,000 it will be rubbish, that will not even cover the design!\n- If you are getting a website for under £5,000 it will be mediocre.\n- If you are planning to run your business through your website then budget for £20,000 to £100,000 for your initial outlay depending on your scale.\n- Update your site often.\n- Use blogs on your site, it will drive traffic.\n\nWARNING: I have worked for companies that look like they can do you a good job but are actually a bunch of muppets who will bump you for everything you have!

I think that this change is a good thing. It moves away from emails being HTML and more towards them as documents. This is the way that most users use email, as documents and it would be much better to have email files as Open XML, there by allowing searching and indexing of the emails in a much easier way.\n\nThis is a move forward in email, not backward. It may be a move backward for the design of marketing emails, but who cares, not the users. IT is an ever changing field, if you can't embrace that then you really should not be in IT.\n\nIt is not the users that are angry. Why would they be, this does not significantly affect them. It is the developers and designers that are angry, get with the program...\n\nAre there any USERS out there that are angry?

    "BodyContent": "Now, I have, up until now, not had any experience with proxy servers. Well, to be honest, I still don't... But I do have some experience with IIS as I have been using it since the sad old days of NT4. Yes that's right, before Active Directory, The bad old days when domains were the work of a craftsman.\n\nAnyhoo, my brother [David](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b \"David Hinshelwood's Profile\") called with a little problem with .pac files for a proxy server. My first though was that I did not know a dam thing about proxy servers, except that annoying \"Access Denied\" message you get when you try to go to the one URL that has the exact answer to the problem you have been trying to solve for hours... Well that's not exactly true, I know what a a proxy server does in theory and what a .pac file does, I have just never used one..\n\n[David](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b \"David Hinshelwood's Profile\") had two problems, well three if you count the network security guru bit.\n\nThe first reared its ugly head when he tried to access a .pac file from IIS. 404! WTF! He could see the file, but no download. Change it to a .txt and there it is. It seams that [IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3bEN-US%3bq258141 \"IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types\"), unlike previous versions. Adding the MIME type solved the problem: David did actually get this far, he just entered an incorrect MIME Type that he found on the web.\n\nInaccurate information on the web! Never... ;)\n\nThe second problem was that he was using a proxy server that was an appliance (i.e. a hardware box that probably said something like \"Cisco proxy magic\" on it) and it did not support host files. He needed a domain to resolve to something other than the IP stated on the web. As I have had some ups and downs with  Active Directory I had had this problem, among others, before. What he needs to do is add the domain he wants to repoint (say google.co.uk) to the DNS server and enter the IP address that he wants it to resolve to. Now when an internal request for that domain reaches the DNS server it is handled internally instead of being forwarded to the big cloud.\n\nSo all problems solved, well theoretically... David still need to try them out side of my little home lab.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [Misc](http://technorati.com/tags/Misc)\n",
