title: Slaying the Dragons and How to Successfully Descale at Scale
short_title: Descaling Agile for Successful Transformation
description: Explores why most organisations struggle to scale agile practices, highlighting key principles and strategies used by rare, successful companies to achieve real transformation.
tldr: Most organizations fail to improve software delivery because they resist real change and try to scale without embracing core agile values and principles. The few that succeed focus on small, meaningful changes rather than just scaling existing practices. To achieve true improvement at scale, prioritize genuine transformation over superficial scaling.

Many organisations don't really want to change how they do business and believe that they can continue in the way they always have while still getting better at delivering software.

**They are wrong!**

While there are organisations that are successfully [scaling]({{< ref "/tags/scaling" >}}) out there, they are exceedingly rare. What are the commonalities between these organisations and how have they managed to get past the illusion of scaled agile to the values and principles that are allowing them to leave their competitors in the dust?

**To go big, you must go small!**
