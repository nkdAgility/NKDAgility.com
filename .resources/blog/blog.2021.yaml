    I have been an [accredited Evidence-based Management Expert with Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/ebm-experts) for the last 7 years and I have been using the [Evidence-based Management Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/) to encourage leaders to make decisions based on evidence instead of gut feel.

    For lots of reasons that program had been taking a back burner with [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}).org over the years. The main reason is that there is a lot of thought and practical evaluation that needs to be done to validate the ideas contained within the guide. My fellow [EBM Experts](https://www.scrum.org/ebm-experts) and I have been evaluating it with customers big and small, from defence to [police services](https://nkdagility.com/blog/professional-organisational-change-ghana-police-service/), and media to [healthcare](https://nkdagility.com/blog/professional-scrum-everyone-organisation/), we have run the numbers, crunched the data and integrated the feedback. It's time to announce the latest course in the Agile [Leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) series! A one-day event, the Professional [Agile Leadership]({{< ref "/tags/agile-leadership" >}}) with Evidence-Based Management Training with Certification (PAL-EBM).

    ![](images/Professional-Agile-Leadership-Evidence-Based-Management-1080x720-5-5.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    A couple of weeks ago I attended one of the first events as well as an additional trainer preparation event Scrum.org calls a Virtual Train the Trainer (vTTT). I have to say that I loved participating in this class.

    One of the key value propositions is that this call is not there to give you metrics that you must use. Instead, we encourage businesses to create their own metrics based on your unique context! You need to have metrics but we are not arrogant enough to assume that we have the right ones for you.

    ## Why do we need a \[types field='code' item='46220'\]\[/types\]?

    You would think that we would not have to say to folks that having a Vision and Strategic Goal is a necessity for success, but we do. That Vision and Strategic Goal need to be communicated to everyone that is working on your Product or within your business. Successful organisations do a better job than unsuccessful ones at connecting their employees to that Vision and Goal, at helping them understand how the work they do every day contributes to that vision and goal.

    ![](images/image-837x720-3-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Time and again I and my colleagues visit companies that either doesn't have a vision or have one that is not communicated. Even when there is one, and it is communicated the ability for people doing the work to connect to that vision is in question.

    **How well do the people doing the work in your company connect with your vision and goal for your product or business?**

    Just as the PAL gets you to think about how you lead an organisation, the PAL-EBM gets you to think about how you measure your success!

    ## Overview of the \[types field='code' item='46220'\]\[/types\]

    One of my customers is asking me about the accountabilities of a [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) and how they break down. While I had seen many things around the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master for my post on [Hiring a Professional Scrum Master](https://nkdagility.com/blog/hiring-a-professional-scrum-master/), this was a little bit more of a discovery session, which is why I asked some of my trusted colleagues at Scrum.org to help out.

    This represents my best efforts to pull together a specification of the Product Owner accountability from the Scrum Guide, agile practitioners, and a little bit of experience.

    ## Hiring a Professional Product Owner

    In general, I do not see companies hiring for a [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) but instead promoting from within. Maximizing the value in the product requires intimate knowledge of the business context, the existing state of the market, and the things that make your business distinctive. They need not only these understandings but also the ability to communicate effectively with Developers and Stakeholders.

    > My take on the above…I am seeing the opposite.  I’m seeing more companies valuing Product Ownership as a skill and going outside for it.  I think this is a positive trend and will probably have the benefit of bringing an outside perspective to a company which may be exactly what a product needs.
    >
    > **Data:** LinkedIn has 12,894 jobs for “Product Owner just in the US right now and 25,520 for “Product Manager”.  Didn’t look at global numbers.
    >
    > \- [Jim Sammons | Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/jim-sammons)

    Adding to Jim's data:

    | Country / Job Title | Product Owner | Product Manager |
    | ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
    | USA                 | 12,894        | 25,520          |
    | UK                  | 9,256         | 23,241          |
    | EU                  | 25,254        | 35,626          |
    | Worldwide           | 119,808       | 300,060         |

    Five A's of Product Ownership

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    I do mention certifications, both from Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance, and please be aware that certification is not an indication of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}) but may be used as a simple bar to reduce the load on interviews and assert a minimum level of knowledge, at $200 for a PSPO I assessment and $250 PSPO II assessment. With a reputation in the industry of not being totally easy, these are a no brainer for any aspiring or experienced Product Owner. There are more than 100k people with PSPO I and 2k people with PSPO II at the time of writing.

    ![](images/image-1-1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    The assessments can be used to inspect and adapt your own knowledge and there is even a free [Product Owner Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open) assessment.

    ## A Scrum Product Owner Job Spec

    The [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the [Scrum Team](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/teams/). How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

    ### Role Summary (Accountabilities)

    This [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) is a key position that sets the tone for product [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) and the definition of success in the organization. As such, modern [product management]({{< ref "/categories/product-management" >}}) practices and mindset are expected to be put into practice daily. This [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) is accountable for and has the authority to maximize the value of the product and the effectiveness of the [Product Backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) by using, but not limited to, these 6 key stances:

    - The Visionary

      - Articulating the strategic vision of the product;
      - Developing and explicitly communicating intermediate [strategic goals]({{< ref "/tags/strategic-goals" >}});
      - Propose how the product can tactically increase its value each Sprint;
      - Understand and shape the impact of the product on our company;
      - Each Sprint ensuring that the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) is prepared to discuss the **most important** Product Backlog items;

    - The Influencer

      - Actively manage stakeholders, their desires, expectations, and outcomes;
      - Create an effective communication strategy;
      - Influence the Developers during Backlog Items Sizing by helping them select and understand trade-offs;
      - Work with Developers daily to clarify and renegotiate the Scope of the Sprint;

    - The Collaborator

      - Collaborating closely with the Developers & Stakeholders daily;
      - Developing and communicating budget, investments, roadmaps, vision, & strategy;
      - Developing controls for a change, risk, quality, & incident management to enable professional Scrum;
      - Developing and influencing commercial contracts that align with the [agile values and principles]({{< ref "/tags/agile-values-and-principles" >}});

    - The Customer Representative

      - Understand the desired outcomes of customers within the bounds of the business constraints
      - Defining our product(s) and services and how customers will interact with them

    - The Decision Maker

      - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood;
      - Ordering Product Backlog items;
      - Choosing what and when to release;

    - The Experimenter
      - Using evidence-based management techniques to optimise outcomes and value delivered;
      - Create hypothesis and craft experiments to test that hypothesis quickly;
      - Tracking product use and impact on end-users and drive consistent approaches across all Product Verticals;

    The [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/) remains accountable.

    ### Role Requirements

    The successful candidate must have the following attributes:

    - First level Scrum Product Owner certification (CSPO, PSPO I);

    - **Product Owner Experience;** Demonstrable experience of product ownership;

    - **Business domain knowledge;** a keen understanding of the \[business domain\], market, and other influencers;

    - **Entrepreneurial focus;** A keen understanding of evidence-based techniques to inform strategic and tactical milestones;

    - **Excellent ideation skills;** with a proven track record of successful hypothesis-driven ideation and sustainable feedback loops;

    - **Excellent communication skills;** Communicating Vision, Goals, and Backlog Items with both the Developers and other Stakeholders;

    In addition, the successful candidate will have some or all of the following attributes:

    - Second level Scrum Product Owner certification (A-CSPO, PSPO II);

    - Experience fulfilling the Product Owner role for at least two years;

    - Knowledge and/or experience with complimentary [Agile product management]({{< ref "/tags/agile-product-management" >}}) techniques: Evidence-based Management, Goal-orientated Product Roadmap, Business Model Canvas, Growth Experiment Canvas, Delegation Poker, [Liberating Structures]({{< ref "/tags/liberating-structures" >}}), Three Horizons Innovation, Stakeholder Mapping, Impact Mapping, Value Pyramids;

    **I would love to get your feedback and discussion on this job specification so that we can make it better!**

    ## **What does this mean?**

    When I sent the above to my customer they condensed it into this easy to digest "What does this mean?" section for communication.

    As you read through this its important to note that it is as much about behaviours as it is about accountabilities.

    - Articulating the strategic vision of the product

    - Developing and explicitly communicating intermediate strategic goals

    - Propose how the product can tactically increase its value each Sprint

    - Understand and shape the impact of the product on our company

    - Collaborating closely with the Scrum Teams & Stakeholders on a daily basis

    - Developing and communicating budget, investments, and road-maps

    - Developing and influencing product governance and controls to enable professional Scrum

    - Understand the desired outcomes of stakeholders within the bounds of the business constraints

    - Defining our product(s) and services and how stakeholders will interact with them

    - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

    - Ordering Product Backlog items

    - Choosing what and when to release

    - Using evidence-based management techniques to optimise outcomes and value delivered

    - Create hypothesis and craft experiments to test that hypothesis quickly

    - Tracking product use and impact on end-users and drive consistent approaches across all Product Verticals

    - Actively manage stakeholders, their desires, expectations, and outcomes

    - Create an effective communication strategy

    - Influence the Developers during Planning and Refinement by helping them select and understand trade-offs

    - Work with Developers daily to clarify and renegotiate the Scope of the Sprint.

    - Each Sprint ensuring that the Scrum Team is prepared to discuss the **most important** Product Backlog items

    The key point in the above is the delegation point; we are not thinking that a single Product Owner is able to conduct all of the above on a Programme of this size – and we obviously have other members of the Hiscox team, and Cognizant Business Analysts to share the load… but accountability remains with the Product Owner.

    In [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Events across the world, I hear repeated the phrase "that's how agile works" when describing behaviours that are both unprofessional and the very opposite of an agile mindset. These behaviours will inhibit agility and are a result of a lack of understanding of the underlying principles.

    We need to stop normalising unprofessional behaviour and call it out whenever we hear it.

    In order for agility to function, we need professionalism; a focus on doing things right so that we don't end up with our beards caught in the mailbox (Norwegian saying). Agility requires more planning, more knowledge, more diligence, more discipline, and more [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}})... not less! It's harder to use agile practices as we are expected to have a usable product at all times, well, at least every iteration of a few weeks. We are most definitely not agile if:

    - We don't have a usable [increment]({{< ref "/tags/increment" >}}) at the end of every iteration -

    - We constantly take on work that we don't understand enough to have a reasonable degree of certainty that it will be completed within the timebox

    - Our team members don't understand how their daily work contributes to the goals and vision of the product

    - We have a Tactical Goal that reflects a list of work to be completed

    - We assign work to individuals and hold them accountable as such

    - We create and organize ability-based groups within our team; programmers, testers, operations

    - You have a deployment process that is not within the control of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) or is linear and bureaucratic.

    - You have a fixed set of requirements that cant be changed based on feedback

    In the traditional world these behaviours were still present, however they were mitigated by time... lots and lots of time.

    Think about the lead software engineer at Volkswagen that got a 3-year prison sentence for following orders and writing code that disabled the catalytic convertor when under emissions tests.

    Think about the engineers at Boeing that dont yet know their fate over the 737 Max.

    When you don't know that these behaviours have a negative impact on our ability to deliver its ignorance, once you know and do it anyway, it's incompetence. We have a moral and ethical responsibility to do the right thing, to protect our customer, our company, and ourselves.

    One of my customers is hiring for the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master Role and asked if I had a handy-dandy [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) Job Spec that they could use. I did not, but there have been a few good ones floating around in the ether so I thought that pulling one together would be a good idea anyway. Here is my best effort to use the existing job postings, and combine them with the latest version of the Scrum Guide.

    ## Hiring a Professional Scrum Master

    The Scrum Master is a challenging position to hire for and finding the right person is even more difficult. Ultimately the Scrum Master is accountable for the effectiveness of the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}). That means that they need to have some level of knowledge of both the relevant business domain to help the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), as well as enough technical knowledge to help the Scrum Team.

    - [Are technical skills required to be a Scrum Master?]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2019/2019-09-01-are-technical-skills-required-to-be-a-scrum-master" >}})

    While there is no need for a Scrum Master to be technical, they do need to understand what effective looks like within the product and the technical domain within which you are creating the product. Ultimately it's worth remembering that certification is not an indication of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}), but may be used as a simple bar to reduce the load on interviews and assert a minimum level of knowledge. At $200 for a PSM I assessment and $250 for the PSM II assessment, and with a reputation in the industry of not being totally easy, these are a no-brainer for any aspiring or experienced Scrum Master. At the time of writing there are more than [350k people with PSM I and 11k people with PSM II](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/count).

    In the empirical world, we have 3 key skill areas of accountability that are needed to effectively deliver products of the highest possible value! We need Influencers that can provide [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) and create environments within which groups of people can organise the work. I consider this the Leadership Track where you have [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Masters, Coaches, and CEO. We need Entrepreneurs who can have a vision and project knowledge and understanding of that vision to the people that need to make that vision happen. This is the Value Track and may be made up of Product Owners, Analysts, and Subject Matter Experts. Last we have the Makers who are the ones who do the work that brings the product to life. They are on the Technical Track and focus on turning the vision into a reality. They have many skills and may have coders, testers, and other experts...

    ![](images/image-4-1280x720-4-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    To have a successful company we need all three tracks to exist in the correct balance!

    ## Scrum is made up of Influencers, Entrepreneurs, and Makers

    Ultimately what do you care about? Do you care about the people, the product, or the work? You have lots of choices here, and you can always cross between these tracks, however, there should be progression and growth in each of them. You should not have to change track to grow.

    ### Leadership Track ( Influencer )

    The job of folks on the Leadership Track is to create an environment within which we can create products of the highest possible value within the bounds of our organisational constraints.

    Those on the Leadership Track have often had experience in both the Value Track and the Technical Track and are familiar with the difficulties of both. They focus on enacting change in the organisation that makes others lives easier and focus on inspiring them to greatness.

    Job Titles that might exist in the Leadership Track: **[Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}), Manager, Agile Coach, Human Resources, CEO, Vice President, Practice Lead**

    #### **Our Training for the Leadership Track**

    \[wpv-view name="2021-courseview" limit="5" wpvrelatedto="45953"\]

    ### Value Track ( Entrepreneurs )

    The job of folks in the Value Track is to maximise the value delivered in the product.

    Those on the Value Track should have experience in the Business Domain, and be experts in the product. Ideally, they have an entrepreneurial spirit and are adept at [experimentation]({{< ref "/tags/experimentation" >}}) and understanding that decision needs to be made based on data.

    Job Titles that might exist in the Value Track: **Business Analysis, [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), User Experience Designer, Subject Matter Expert**

    #### **Our Content for the Value Track**

    \[wpv-view name="2021-postlist" limit="5" wpvrelatedto="45955"\]

    ### Technical Track ( Makers)

    The job of folks in the Technical Track is to create a usable product every iteration.

    Those on the Technical Track should have experience in the Technical Domain and some knowledge of the Business Domain. Ideally, they have a broad set of technical skills that allows them to work in any part of the product and some deep expertise that they have or are seeking, mastery over.

    Job Titles that might exist in the Value Track: **Coders, UX Designers, Testers, Security Specialists**

    #### **Our Training for the Value Track**

    \[wpv-view name="2021-courseview" limit="5" wpvrelatedto="45954"\]

    ## **Upcoming Training Opportunities**

    We love training and have many classes! Most of our classes are private for customer, but we also have a few public classes that you can join.

    ## Managers transition to Leaders

    As organisations move towards modern management practices there will be less of a need for Managers. However that does not mean that those same people are not needed! Their role is shifting from managing people, to managing effectiveness and leading people!

    In a traditional organization, people report to people up the chain of hierarchy.  No matter how important we say our customers are to our company, people (even managers) RESPOND to Who is Above Them. We need to change this and upend the story. CxO's become responsible for clearing obstacles for the Leaders in the organisation to do the same for their teams.

    All [technical debt]({{< ref "/tags/technical-debt" >}}) is a risk to the product and to your business.

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    So why is so much of software opaque to the business? Why does the business have a fire-and-forget mentality and little interest in understanding what they are investing in?

    **The modern businesses negligence in understanding their capital investment is in that lack of understanding. You can't hide it in a cost centre forever.**

    **Reviewer(s):** [Adam Moss FBCS CITP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-moss/)

    ## TL;DR;

    Every business (receiving entity) requesting a custom solution should expect valuable delivery of the highest possible quality. Your delivery should valuable and work; be free from known defect.

    _**All technical debt is risk to the product and to your business.**_

    Technical debt is like an unhedged fund! There is no asset securing that risk, no insurance for it. Technical debt is 100% risk.

    Since [Product Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/product-delivery" >}}) is a capital expenditure the output is an asset of your organisation in the same way that a building or equipment is. All of these assets should be accurately represented on a balance sheet and likely part of your year-end accounts. Part of the worth of your company.

    **There is a name given to miss representing an organisational asset, either knowingly or unknowingly, on your corporate accents: fraud.**

    ## "But, not all debt is bad!"

    I hear the phrase "but not all debt is bad" a lot, usually coupled with "some level of debt is manageable" and, as a software developer, it makes me cringe. There is no acceptable level of technical debt.

    - **Poorly written or difficult to understand** - if it takes new people weeks to become productive then you likely have a product that is difficult to read, difficult to change, and prone to error.

    - **Changing things results in faults** - any time your team turns into a bunch of Plumber's sucking air when you suggest a change you know that part of the system has way too much technical debt.

    - **Lack of Automation** - Anything that can be automated should be, anything that cant should be rearchitected so that it can be.

    It's important to understand that technical debt does not accumulate linearly. It can take years for the debt to accumulate, and years for it to become a serious problem. It sneaks up on you, and suddenly you are lying bloody on the floor wondering where your wallet is.

    ## The non-linear accumulation of technical debt

    A good example of this is from the Developer Division (DivDev) at Microsoft in developing a product called Team Foundation Server. This commercial product was built using traditional [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}) practices and delivered on a two-yearly cadence. From 2005 (first beta) until 2012 they worked, successfully delivering a new version every 2 years. Even before 2012 [Leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}), and engineers, had noticed that things were getting bogged down. Things were just taking longer to deliver than before and by 2012, with circa 600 people working on it, they were delivering just over 24 features to production each year.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-2-4-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    TFS was delivered on a 2 year cycle.

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    The gap between their features and competitors was growing, and customer expectations were only able to be met by sacrificing yet more quality for speed. On a two-yearly cadence, it takes four years to deliver on feature requests.

    Technical debt had become a serious business problem!

    ### Paying back the technical debt

    Two visionaries at Microsoft, Brian Harry and Aaron Bjork, started to make changes to tackle this problem. They saw that they needed to get closer to the customers need. To do this they had to shorten the feedback loop, and they settled on 3-week Sprints using [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}).

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-3-5-5.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Three weeks Sprints instead!

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    And boy was that hard! Moving to 3-week Sprints created a level of [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) that instilled fear! Fear of failure, fear of being an imposter, fear of being held accountable. Aaron and Brian worked hard to push forward and alleviate those fears so that they could really see what was going on and create an environment where the product delivery teams could do their best work.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) Team Feature delivery per year!

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    It took them many years of hard work paying back the now transparent Technical Debt to get to where they are now. They have decoupled delivery and release, and while they still have a 3-week release cadence most of the work is done within [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}). Feedback from customers can be implemented and delivered within hours or days, not months and years.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-1-3-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    What metrics to watch, and some to not!

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    This became a game-changer for the whole group and ultimately was rolled out throughout Microsoft changing the company from a large oil tanker to a flotilla of patrol boats looking for opportunities to provide value.

    ## Technical Debt will always bite back

    It’s the compound nature of the debt, its ninja-like hiding ability, and deceptive payback cost that is the risk. You have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.

    **It's like a sub-prime Mortgage pack: We are making a lot of money now by steaming ahead and running that tightrope of debt vs delivery, but at some point, we are just screwed!**

    I just don’t believe that if the business (read CFO) of the receiving entity really understood the risk that technical debt creates that they would ever approve of any level of acceptable debt. If you don't create a culture of quality then we:

    - Are not really sure what is done and what is not

    - Have no idea what we can do and when it will be done

    - Have no idea what even needs to be done

    **It’s a Roadkill Burger! It may indeed be tasty at the moment, but you will eventually get sick and die.**

    The [Scrum Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/) only contains the minimum necessary to create an e**mpirical process control system for managing risk**. The new [Kanban Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide/) reflects the minimum that you need to do to create a **strategy for optimizing the flow of value through a visual, pull-based system**.

    With the integration of the [Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams](https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide-for-scrum-teams/) into the world of [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}).org, I had been waiting for Daniel Vacanti and co to release more around Professional [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}). It was my very first thought when I attended the beta teach of the [Professional Scrum with Kanban](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-kanban-training-with-certification/) training in Burlington, Masatusis in January 2018.

    **I did not have to wait long.**

    Daniel has founded [ProKanban.org](https://prokanban.org/) and collaborated to create, under creative commons, the [Kanban Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide/). This guide is freely available on [kanbanguides.org](https://kanbanguides.org/) and starts a new era of openness and respect between the Scrum & Kanban communities.

    As part of this, I have become the 20th [Professional Kanban Trainer](https://prokanban.org/trainers/) at ProKanban.org and I am now able to teach the [Applying Professional Kanban training](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/) class.

    ### Becoming a Professional Kanban Trainer

    The [journey to become a Professional Kanban Trainer](https://prokanban.org/become-a-trainer/) is documented on the Pro Kanban site and involves applications, interviews, asssessments, and training.

    If you want to become a trainer then please reach out to them. Daniel and Colleen are amazing.

    ### Applying Professional Kanban with Certification

    In the [Professional Scrum with Kanban](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-kanban-training-with-certification/) training, we spend the first day on Kanban and then the second on how Kanban interfaces with the Scrum Framework. In [Applying Professional Kanban](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/) training, we spend two whole days on Kanban:

    #### Applying Professional Kanban Syllabus

    - Kanban theory, principles and practices
    - Applying Kanban
    - Workflow design and visualization
    - How to operate a Kanban system
    - How to get started

    [Applying Professional Kanban Training with Certification](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/)

    #### [Professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) with Kanban Syllabus

    - Dispelling Common Myths
    - Understanding Professional Scrum
    - Kanban Theory, Principles and Practices
    - Kanban in Practice
    - Scrum with Kanban

    [Professional Scrum with Kanban Training with Certification](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-kanban-training-with-certification/)

    These two are very different classes that are founded on the same core theory, principals, and practices to create the same outcome. I love teaching Scrum & Kanban together, and I am really looking forward to teaching Kanban on its own!

    ### Study Guide for Professional Kanban I Assessment

    You don't have to take the [Applying Professional Kanban](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/) training to take the assessment. They are decoupled and they have an excellent [Kanban Learning Resources](https://prokanban.org/kanban-learning-resources/) page that will help you get started. I have forked that resource and will be adding some of my own items on the [Study Guide for Professional Kanban](https://nkdagility.com/study-guide-for-professional-kanban/).

    For many people the traditional [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}) methodologies (see PMI / PRINCE2) are the root of the problems that birthed Waterfall. I assert that this is the tip of the iceberg. These methodologies are just a symptom of a greater problem that has its roots in the changes made during the industrial revolution. These changes, while they generated great amounts of wealth and many jobs around the world,  dehumanised work and destroyed the essence of value and discovery that brought humanity to where it is now. It created processes that turned people into little more than sophisticated robots and enshrined that thinking into the very core of how we do things.

    **These practices, which spread like cancer, have been seeded around the world by the Master of Business Administration (MBA). These practices have been calcified in the malignant bureaucracy that can be likened to an iceberg that may very well sink your company.**

    ## What is Taylorism, and why Waterfall is just the tip of the iceberg!

    Prior to the industrial revolution, goods were made in small cottage industries and people worked close to their home. Customers were local, and both the producer and the consumer knew each other well. Mastery in ones chosen profession was paramount and rewards for the master craftsman were earned through increased money, or more time to pursue other interests.

    ![](images/r760277b192cbd4c9dda3a29a129065064804389101574249955-14-14.jpeg)
    { .post-img }

    When the industrial revolution came along, massive mechanisation was needed to produce goods at scale. However the technology of the time was unable to automate at that scale, so the only available "machines" were people. When, in pursuit of higher production volumes, you take away from people their autonomy, mastery, and purpose in your pursuit, you take away their soul. When you take away the essential elements of rewarding work, people become mindless automatons.

    > Frederick Winslow Taylor is a controversial figure in management history. His innovations in industrial engineering, particularly in time and motion studies, paid off in dramatic improvements in productivity. At the same time, he has been credited with destroying the soul of work, of dehumanizing factories, making men into automatons.
    >
    > _Vincenzo Sandrone_

    Traditional management practices were born out of the disengagement of the workforce. With the outcome controlled and repeatable, management focuses on best practices and incentivising people to work faster and harder. They wanted to remove thinking from the work since thinking creates ideas, and ideas create deviations from the pre-defigned optimal way of working.

    **The thinking goes like this: Ideas and innovation from your workers were a risk to your business and thus must be eliminated. We need to remove thinking!**

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    When you remove thinking from work and turn people into automatons:

    - **People don't care about the work -** and your workforce disengages, so their interest in the work and empathy for the customer also wains. Your workforce doesn't care about the work, and workers primary concern is no longer the success of the company. They are instead concerned mainly with the output of their repetitive operation and maintaining or increasing their levels of remuneration.

    - **People become replaceable cogs -** Indeed the company comes to see an uneducated workforce who just do as they are told as easily replaceable resources. They don't have any discernable skills and the company has many people waiting for those jobs that can be easily slotted in. The company now no longer cares about the individual and they become resources to be allocated and replaced.

    These two outcomes result in an erosion of trust between the workers and the company.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-3-1280x720-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Lack of trust was inherent to the Tayloristic ideals

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    These working practices have resulted in:

    - **Put people in competency-based groups** - this has not only resulted in isolated silos but also hierarchies within organisations.

    - **Create standard practices** - The idea that Best Practices can be created and the best outcomes will result from the use of these practices.

    - **Reduced wage based on expected low performance and bonuses offered for increased output** - in the output-driven world, we need our employees to be competing for the jobs so that they toe the line or lose their jobs and the benefits that come with them.

    **This was the advent of the age of bureaucracy**.

    If you think about the school system in most countries, especially if you are over 30; we all sat in rows, did the same thing at the same time, were forbidden from talking, and teachers used incentive based learning! I assert that there is no difference between this and the treatment of factory workers. **_The modern school system was developed during the industrial revolution to train factory workers._**

    <figure>

    </figure>

    The end result is that many people have been trained from an early age to be factory workers. However very few of us will end up as factory workers today. We will more likely be office workers, solving cognitive business problems.

    ## Is Taylorism ingrained in the way we work today?

    If you are lucky enough to work in one of the small numbers of companies that have already transitioned away from departments, hierarchies, headcount, work breakdown, best practices, and individual bonus systems then you are fortunate, or maybe selective.

    ![](images/2021-01-13_19-34-57-1280x635-1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    **Most people are not so lucky.**

    ### The trouble with departments & hierarchies

    In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived as untrustworthy. Managers were needed to tell workers what to do and how to do it. As our organisations grew we needed managers to manage the growing number of managers and incentivise those managers to increase productivity in our employees through any means that they could.

    > "**Put people in competency based groups**"
    >
    > The Scientific Management Method

    Using the Scientific Management Method the Business Owners should identify each problem domain (e.g. Sales, HR, Marketing, Engineering, Testing) and come up with the "one true way" to do that work within the domain. The Business Owners can then hire managers and workers that will be trained in the "one true way" of doing that work, and minimise deviation from the Business Owners control.

    <figure>

    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Put people into ability-based groups.

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    And so we created departments so we could centralise training and knowledge on a single topic. If you were hired for sales, you ended up in the sales department: Completely disconnected from the makers, the designers, and the implementers. There would be no need for communications between Sales and the other departments since we have planned all of their work methods and need only follow the script.

    As the world became more complex and sales became a creative endeavour the imposed departmental isolation model became a negative impact. Sales personnel started making decisions in the complex world only taking sales concerns into account; that, by design, was all they knew. Creation and delivery had no bearing on closing deals, so they were ignored except in the most general terms. To close the deal and get ones bonus sales personnel only needed to get the customer to sign, it mattered not if you could actually deliver.

    **Often the result of this relationship was animosity between the departments, and unhappy customers when either quality, money, time, or features had to suffer.**

    An example of this was the Microsoft Azure Platform. Salespeople were measures and bonuses paid based on the amount of Azure that customers bought. This measure resulted in salespeople pushing output over the outcome. They sold millions of dollars of Azure to companies that never used it. This resulted in unhappy customers and declining sales. Customer failed to see the value in what they were buying.

    Then Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) changed the measure for Sales from the output based measure to one based on the customer's outcome. Salespeople were no longer bonused based on how much they sold, but instead on how much a customer used. This change was revolutionary for sales of Azure. They were no longer focused on the short term ( to get executives to sign) but on a much longer engagement model with customers. It became critical to encourage customers, with direct help, to move towards [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) practices. Microsoft provided ( and continued to provide) consultants and coaches to help create better outcomes for customers. This has paid off hugely for Microsoft as they are now the largest cloud computing provider despite starting late.

    This seemingly small change in how people are measured changed behaviours greatly. Many salespeople left Microsoft as a direct result as they were only interested in the short term, and not the long term investment in customer success.

    Microsoft also restructured how Sales personnel work so rather than it being one huge department each product was responsible for their own Sales, Marketing, Engineering, and Support. With Sales now a skill within the Product teams instead of a separate organisation, Product Groups can leverage the combined knowledge of all disciplines to encourage customers to use more azure.

    ### The trouble with Best Practices

    In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived as unskilled. Business owners needed to create standard operating procedures for every facet of work within each problem domain. The work of the time existed within the simple space. The work being performed may by categorised as "simple", with relatively few unknowns. Manufacturing created a large volume of pre-defined work in a low variance environment where the outcomes of the work were known before the work was performed. Output was the only control and correlated directly to profitability.

    > "Create standard practices and train workers in those practices"
    >
    > The Scientific Management Method

    Since there was a low variability in the work we could plan it all out beforehand, and simply follow that plan. We could hire managers to maintain order and compliance with defined methods, and treat employees as simple replicable cogs.

    **Business owners created _best practices_ for creating products and expected everyone else to follow them.**

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-8-8-8.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    As the world became more complicated and we were able to create automation using machinery with software to control it. The simple, low variance work could be automated. This allowed workers to focus on more complex cognitive tasks, but the management practices more suited to repetitive, low-variance work persisted.

    Although the work had changed, the belief in predictive planning prevailed. There was a belief that if people just followed the detailed work breakdown and Gant chart, then everything would be fine.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-9-9-9.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    **Best Practices, Centers of Excellence, and Innovation Labs are all constructs of the Tayloristic practices designed for simple, low-variance work. These practices seek to exert more control over the new complex modern world of work.**

    Even in the simple, low-variance domain, the old Tayloristic practices based on the Scientific Management Method destroy the soul of work. These practices create workers that hate the work, their managers, and the company.

    **We need a new way!**

    In the simple world, the Toyota Production System is the poster child of innovation and discovering new ways of working. Optimizing the workspace and creating good practices became the job of the employee and they were encouraged to periodically stop and reflect on how to do things better.

    In the complex world of Sales, Marketing, and [Software Development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) we also needed new ways of thinking that would power the same ideas from Toyota and [Lean]({{< ref "/categories/lean" >}}) into the high variance world of complex cognitive work. This was the birth of the Agile movement with the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Framework (1993), the Agile Manifesto (2001), and later [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) (2004).

    Instead of coming up with best practices, we realise that there are only good practices for the situation at hand. A good practice, today might not be quite so good tomorrow, and thus we need to be a lot more flexible. No longer is the business owner (or manager) the best person to define these practices since they are no longer close to the problem.

    > We are uncovering better ways of developing "products" by doing it and helping others do it.
    >
    > Agile Manifesto, 2001

    The best people to make decisions and define practices are those with the most information. Today that is the people doing the complex cognitive work.

    We need to accept that our practices are imperfectly defined. With this in mind, we need to push responsibility for defining those practices down to the people doing the work: they have the information required to make better decisions about which actions are more likely to yield the desired outcomes.

    ### The trouble with Task and Bonus systems

    In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived to be lazy. It was perceived that revenue was lost due to this lazy, malingering workforce and so business owners needed to figure out how to minimise downtime and maximize output. Since managers were keeping people with the same ability in the same group, and planning everyone's work, the one remaining thing to be controlled was the worker's focus.

    > "Reduced wage based on expected low performance and bonuses for increased output"
    >
    > The Scientific Management Method

    Managers used various methods to incentivise workers to work harder and faster:

    - **Taylor Differential Piece Work System** -  This system provides for higher rewards to more efficient workers. For different levels of output below and above the standard, different piece rates are applicable.

    - **Gantt task and bonus system** - the system consists of paying a worker on a time basis if he does not attain the standard and on piece basis (high rate) if he does.

    - **Emerson’s efficiency system** - Under this system minimum time wages are guaranteed, but beyond a certain efficiency level, a bonus in addition to minimum day wages is given

    The Task and Bonus system is by far the most prevailing practice today, however, all of these systems were designed to create the same outcome and have a similar negative impact on workers.

    Developed by Henry Gantt, the Task and Bonus system is an augmentation to the Taylor Differential piece work system and was intended to pay workers a low wage, since we expect them to have low performance, and then have a bonus that takes them to a potential high wage.

    **Taylor, Gantt, and Emerson all created different "Carrot and the Stick" approaches to management.**

    There are other ways to try and incentivise people, rather than just how they are remunerated:

    - **Employee Of the Month** - The Employee of the Month (EOM) is a type of reward program given out by companies (often to encourage the staff to work harder and more productively).

    - **Performance Appraisals** - A performance appraisal, also referred to as a performance review, performance evaluation, (career) development discussion, or employee appraisal is a method by which the job performance of an employee is documented and evaluated. Performance appraisals are a part of career development and consist of regular reviews of employee performance within organizations.

    - **Hierarchy Progression** - The idea that job title in some way related to reward, success or expertise.

    The idea that you need to dangle a carrot in front of the employees in order to get them to work more efficiently is a logical outcome of the practices we have been discussing throughout this article.

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-10-3-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    The carrot ("equality") and the stick ("Control")

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    There have been many studies done at universities around the world on financial incentives for employees. All of them agree that higher pay and bonuses only resulted in better performance when the tasks were basic mechanical tasks. More money works for tasks that have a pre-defined set of steps with a single answer.

    If a task involved even a small amount of cognitive skills, decisions making, or creativity then more money resulted in **_lower_** performance. This is contrary to the common understanding of wage incentives.

    If you are managing people you should pay them enough so that they feel that they are compensated fairly and not struggling to meet their basic needs. You should pay them enough to take the issue of money off the table.

    There are three key areas that Leaders need to focus on that will increase the performance of your workforce:

    - **Autonomy** — Employees desire to be self-directed. Autonomy increases engagement.

    - **Mastery** — The urge to get better at a skill, craft, or discipline.

    - **Purpose** — The desire to do something that has meaning and is important.

    Clients do not come first. Employees come first.

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    If you and your business only focus on profits without valuing your employees need for autonomy, mastery, and purpose then you may end up with unhappy employees and poor customer service. I don't know about you, but I do not do my best work when I am unhappy!

    ## The trouble with Taylorism

    These Tayloristic practices worked well for employers during the industrial revolution. However, even factory work has progressed in the shadow of the Toyota Production System and the lean movement. People are no longer cogs in a machine that can be replaced at a moments notice. Each employee brings a unique skill or ability to your [product discovery]({{< ref "/tags/product-discovery" >}}) and [product development]({{< ref "/categories/product-development" >}}) story. That story will be unique because of it. These Tayloristic practices kill ingenuity, focus, and enthusiasm.

    In the [The Evidence-Based Management Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/) we talk about the [Intermediate Strategic Goal](https://nkdagility.com/blog/product-goal-is-an-intermediate-strategic-goal/) and I likened that to the [Product Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal) in the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide). If we also think of each Sprint as a tactical move towards fulfilling that [Product Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal) then the [Sprint Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal) becomes an Intermediate Tactical Goal that moves us towards our current Intermediate Strategic Goal.

    ## Sprint Goal is an Immediate Tactical Goal

    The [Sprint Goal is a Commitment for the Sprint Backlog](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal) and should never be "complete those 10 things" but instead should to describe the Why of the Sprint.

    ![](images/naked-agility-hypothesis-driven-2-2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    Just as the [Product Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal) provides the current Strategic direction so the [Sprint Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal) is the smaller step, the implementation step towards it. The [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner) is accountable for maximizing the value delivered and should be thinking hard, with the help of the Developers, on what the next tactical outcome they want to try and achieve is.

    This [Sprint Goal](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal) should be high level and I would recommend that using a [Lean]({{< ref "/categories/lean" >}}) Canvas to help identify not only the business objective but the behaviour that the [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner) is trying to create in users or other systems. While I favour the Lean UX Canvas, which we teach in the [Professional Scrum with UX](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-training/), there are many valid options out there to use as a complementary practice in this space.

    At a minimum, I would expect a [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner) to have a hypothesis. A hypothesis is like an assumption, but also with a measure/metric that tells you if you have validated that assumption.

    [Product Owners](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner) are accountable for maximising value and should be looking to not just build features that customers need now, but predict or drive which features that they need now.

    ### A good [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) will build features now that your customers need now.

    We should always be working to engage with our users; users don't engage when you build a feature that they will need in 6 months. Instead, we should focus on what will solve an immediate business problem for our users. This will engage them in the process and elicit much more excellent feedback from them.

    ### A great Product Owner will anticipate the features that customers need now.

    The trick for any [Product Owner](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner) is to figure out where the market is going and build features that drive it, rather than just following it. Having a vision and entrepreneurially iterating towards that vision empirically with many small hypotheses is key to unlocking this level up of Product Ownership.

    Story Points and velocity have been used for many years in the [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) community and have been engrained so much in the way that things are done that most folks believe that they are part of Scrum. The accepted wisdom is that Scrum Teams are supposed to use User Stories, Story Points, and Velocity to measure their work.

    **Accepted wisdom is wrong!**

    ## Velocity and Story Points are not Scrum

    There are a number of things that we collectively believe are required to do Scrum, and these have been perpetrated by the long-running perseverance of trainers teaching to the lowest common denominator and keeping things as simple as possible. There is the general consensus in the trainer community that folks that attend Scrum training are not smart enough to do anything else. However, if you go have a look at the [Scrum Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/) and see how many time common things that you believe are mandated in Scrum are referenced:

    - Velocity: 0

    - Story Points: 0

    - Burndown: 0

    - User Stories: 0

    - Original Estimate: 0

    - Bug Count: 0

    - Actual Completed: 0

    ![](images/image-11-1106x720-2-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    The answer to all of these searchers is zero! These are complementary practices that may or may not work within the bounds of your organisational complexity, and all of these are an indication to me that your organisations are only [just starting its evolution towards agility](https://nkdagility.com/blog/evolution-not-transformation-this-is-the-inevitability-of-change/).

    ## Managing the unknown is hard

    It's ok for a team to start with Story Points and Velocity. There are many things that change when a team moves from the traditional [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}) practices of the past to the empirical practices of the future, and sometimes we need to pick our battles. One such battle is that of story points and velocity and in fact all of the gubbins surrounding it.

    Perhaps you need to appease other parts of the organisation that are not yet ready for change. Perhaps you have a long journey and this is just somewhere to start.

    **Story Points & Velocity can be a good starting point!**

    <figure>

    Planning Poker

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    I am not saying that there is no value in Story Points or Planning Poker. When a team is just starting out they need to keep things simple and iterate towards better outcomes. We often start from typical traditional practices and Planning Poker becomes a good learning point. Story Points use rough sizing as a way to analyze the work and break it down.

    Because really, the scores are made up and the points don't matter. It's the conversation that is a valuable thing. The shared understanding that the participants get by having some way to know when they don't understand the same things. **That is awesome.**

    However, agile teams try to use Story Points and Velocity for future predictability and this is a fallacy. While I would be OK with a team using it for a while, if an Agile Team is still using Velocity and Story Points after they have 5 or 10 sprints under their belt then I would have serious concerns about their ability to adapt to change and their sincerity towards that change. What I mean is that they just don't understand their work or its nature; This is what I mean by immaturity, and not that something else is a sign of maturity!

    Indeed as the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) using Story Points really has no consistent reference they are just shooting in the dark the same as they were before.

    While they have gained an understanding of the goals, they still don't have an understanding of the predictability and thus no confidence in their predictions. We need concrete data to build trust with stakeholders that we know what we are talking about.

    **We need confidence!**

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-27-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Velocity

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    Velocity was a way to assert that confidence with a plot of our delivered story points, and along with some clever calculations we asserted that we were likely to deliver about 20 story points. This was such a wholly improbable assumption that the vast majority of Scrum Teams talk about "carry-over" points and quiz me about how to represent that. Do you re-estimate and stick it on the backlog, does it move to the next sprint?

    Scrum Teams have been basing their confidence to stakeholders on an agreed consensus that cant be compared and is susceptible to any change from the makeup of the team from the [estimation]({{< ref "/tags/estimation" >}}) room.

    **We need confidence!**

    ## Confidence Through [Transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}})

    Confidence is gained by truly understanding the uncertainty of delivery and factoring it into our projections. How sure are you that you will be able to deliver? No really! what is your statistical level of confidence?

    <figure>

    ![](images/image-5-10-10.png)
    { .post-img }

    <figcaption>

    Confidence in the dace of uncertainty

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    In the empirical world where more is unknown than known, we don't plan all of the work (it will change) and we cant tell you when things will be done.

    **Except when we can!**

    - **The [Increment]({{< ref "/tags/increment" >}}) is the Confidence of Transparency of the Future** - If we have a Scrum Team then I should be confident in saying that we will have a usable increment at the end of every Sprint. If that is true, then we can have 100% confidence that we can deliver the output from the last Sprint. It works, and it's done!

    - **The [Product Backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) is the Confidence of Transparency of the Future** - Since we have a backlog that has been ordered by the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), who is accountable for maximizing the value delivered I can be confident that what we have Done represents the most valuable things that we could have done.

    With both of these being true we can have 100% confidence that we have the most valuable items that the business needs to be completed and ready to deploy. Every additional Sprint just adds to the quantity of value.

    [Cycle Time]({{< ref "/tags/cycle-time" >}}) Scatter Plot lets you find your confidence

    </figcaption>

    </figure>

    Using a cycle time scatter plot we can assess and find our confidence levels, and even [create a Service Level Expectation](https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide-for-scrum-teams/#h-service-level-expectation-sle), that allows us to measure progress against.

    You can use this range of confidence levels to determine your current levels of predictability, and monitor the effect of changes that you make to your system on it. If you have an 85% confidence level of 16 days and you're on 2-week Sprints then you have a problem.

    This data is not hard to collect and find a full list of awesome metrics in the [Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams](https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide-for-scrum-teams/) from Scrum.org.
