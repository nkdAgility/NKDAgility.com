I get asked a lot at conferences and at customers how [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) and [Continuous Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}) can work together. The reality is that they complement each other and at the last Scrum.org F2F I sat down to make a little video on the way I think that it works.

Scrum Tapas is a series of short videos that give you a bite sized look into the Scrum world on a specific topic.
