    One thing I loved, with the update of Media Player 11 and ActiveSync 4.2, on my phone ([Windows Mobile 5.0](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/default.mspx "Microsoft Windows Mobile") - [Orange](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly "Orange SPV M3100") [SPV M3100](http://www.coolsmartphone.com/index.php?option=articles&task=viewarticle&artid=680&Itemid=3 "SPV M3100 Review")) with Windows XP was that it detected that I had a 1gb SD card and added it to the sync devices of Media Player. This allowed me to download my Channel9 and DotNetRocks podcasts and sync them with my phone on a daily basis. I just could not be bothered to sync them manually before.

    Then I updated to Vista! And the feature disappeared :(

    I hope it is just because the "Mobile Device Center" is currently still in beta, but I get to sync with my main memory on my phone (50mb) but not my 1gb card.

    Lets hope they fix this so I can listen to my podcasts again!

    I have found this interesting policy for TFS.

    [http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320 "http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320")

    I can see a number of problems with it.

    - What if a developer gets interrupted!
    - What is they are working on a number of related tasks / bugs!

    The solution to these problems is maybe an external system tray application that the checkin policy can communicate with that allows the developer to select what tasks that he/she is working on and update it accordingly!

    This is something that I will need to look into!

    Has anyone tried this tool in a production enviroment?

    I can see that this project is going to be fun. I need to deploy team system within the investment bank that I work for. The DBA's will not let me access their servers! And the TFS installation needs to be run on them.

    However their is a way round this which a nice man called [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/ "Brian Keller") let me in on, thanks Brian.

    You can create the databases on another server and use "How to: Restore Team Foundation Server Data to a Different Server" to move the database's across.

    Has anyone tried this?

    Check out the TFS Administration Guide at [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2AED0ECC-1552-49F1-ABE7-4905155E210A&displaylang=en](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2AED0ECC-1552-49F1-ABE7-4905155E210A&displaylang=en).  
    Be sure to note the steps in the KB article for assistance opening the guide [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/902225/](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/902225/).

    I have now created a new project within [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") that encompases all of the features of WhiteLabel, but with a whole host of extras. The WhiteLabel project is now complete and a release will be uploaded as soon as [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") starts working again.

    [http://www.codeplex.com/RDdotNET](http://www.codeplex.com/RDdotNET)[](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=RDdotNET)

    The new project is called "RD.NET Community Foundation" and will provide a building block for a number of types of community site. I plan to build a number of services for this system in addition to WhiteLabel.

    - **GlobalisationService** - This service will handle text and other localisation elements for any site. It will allow the user to have multiple languages on one site and hopefully implement such things a LHS/RHS and posibly coloquial layouts as a extention to the WhiteLabel service.
    - **RelationshipService** - The ralationship service will handle multiple types of relationships for multiple sites. e.g. Contact Management, Dating, Networking among others.
    - **ShellService** - The shell service will provide access to an application built using the Client Application block that will load modules on demand from a sql server backend. It will implement versioning and user authentication. I hope to manage the failier of any modules so that other modules are not affected.

    The whole system will be fully extensable in teh same vain as the current WhiteLabel service in that all the services have a set of client assemblies that allow the developer to configure which services he is connecting to and where he is connecting to them from a simple one line config section.

    This is a big chalange for me and will take some time. I will not be giving up... I may write some documentation as well.

    If you are trying to get windows mobile device center running on Vista 6000 RTM then you will need to install the beta as it is not actively released.

    Update 2006-12-20

    Although [Daniel Moth](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog) made a comment about doing a windows update while the phone is connected, this did not work. As the "Windows Mobile Device Center" is not out of beta, you need to download it manually.

    At last .NET Framework 3.0 is live! I have been desperate to use it in work ever since I got a book on Indigo as I can see so many applications for it that would increase developer productivity and consistency.

    I have upgraded my CodePlex project to use WCF, and what a difference it makes:

    - Cleaner code
    - less code
    - more functionality

    It is amazing what a few attribute tags can make.

    Over the last wee while I have been seeing a lot of talk of “Web 2.0” and I wondered what the hell it was! Was it .NET related? No. (Well kind of) So I set out on the onerous task of finding out. So I Googled it, and low and behold, the first result!

    [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html)

    It seams that Web 2.0 or “The Internet 2.0” is more of an ethos than a single point.

    I mention it as “Web 2.0” is becoming a buzz word for middle management, and so when asked if your project is “Web 2.0” you will be able to answer!

    I am currently evaluating WCF for my company. Now, ML has some pretty strong polocies on beta software, but they seam to be missing something with WinFX. I can find information on the company intranet on Vista and Office 2007, I can even request them to be installed on my desktop as part of an internal beta program, but nothing on WinFX or WCF!

    I think that they are considering it as less of .NET Framework 3.0 and more of .Net Framework 2.5, rather like the 1.1 release. Yes, the features that they are providing are amazing, and posibly revolutionary as they are leading the way for other development enviroments that need to rely on third party software for the tasks that can be acomplished by WinFX.

    Having read the white paper [The Future of ASP.NET Web Services in the Context of the Windows Communication Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/aspnetwebservices_wcf.asp) and may others, I am in agreement with Craig McMurtry that WCF represents a gient leap in consistancy and security.

    I will be recommending to my company that any future web service projects be done in WCF, with the ability of older clients to communicate in a basic means, and with the benefits of security, cross-service transactions and token authentication I think that this new technology will serve any company well.

    I was very surprised to find that CAB did not support a higher-level component like the ToolStrip in its basic implementation. I resolved to fix this and added an adapter and factory for the ToolStripPanel initially, but I encountered issues with the ToolStripContainer. As my first post, here is the ToolStripPanel code.

    There are two parts to this and two ways to implement it. The first option is to edit the existing ToolStrip UI factory to include the new code, but I prefer not to do this as future CAB updates might require re-implementing the adaptations.

    The second option is to inherit from the current classes in your own assembly and adapt the class to support both. This way, you extend the functionality without replacing it.

    Here is the code for the new `ToolStripPanelUIAdapterFactory` factory:

    ```vb
    Public Class ToolStripPanelUIAdapter
        Inherits UIElementAdapter(Of ToolStrip)

        Private innerToolStripPanel As ToolStripPanel

        Public Sub New(ByVal objToolStripPanel As ToolStripPanel)
            Guard.ArgumentNotNull(objToolStripPanel, "objToolStripPanel")
            Me.innerToolStripPanel = objToolStripPanel
        End Sub

        Protected Overrides Function Add(ByVal uiElement As ToolStrip) As ToolStrip
            If Me.innerToolStripPanel Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException()
            End If
            Me.innerToolStripPanel.Join(uiElement, 3)
            Return uiElement
        End Function

        Protected Overrides Sub Remove(ByVal uiElement As ToolStrip)
            If Me.innerToolStripPanel.Controls.Contains(uiElement) Then
                Me.innerToolStripPanel.Controls.Remove(uiElement)
            End If
        End Sub
    End Class
    ```

    As you can see, this class inherits from the CAB class of the same name, overrides the same methods, and adds support for the new adapter for the `ToolStripPanel`.

    Now, you can add the factory to the UI Element Adapter Factory Catalog in the `AfterShellCreated` part of the main shell application:

    ```vb
    Dim catalog As IUIElementAdapterFactoryCatalog = RootWorkItem.Services.Get(Of IUIElementAdapterFactoryCatalog)()
    catalog.RegisterFactory(New UIElements.ToolStripUIAdapterFactory())
    ```

    The CAB framework will now handle `ToolStripPanel`s as UI Extension Sites with the appropriate factory. Now, all we need is the adapter...

    Here is the code for the `ToolStripPanelAdapter`:

    ```vb
    Public Class ToolStripPanelUIAdapter
        Inherits UIElementAdapter(Of ToolStrip)

        Private innerToolStripPanel As ToolStripPanel
        Private Shared NumberOfAddedControls As Integer = 0

        Public Sub New(ByVal objToolStripPanel As ToolStripPanel)
            Guard.ArgumentNotNull(objToolStripPanel, "objToolStripPanel")
            Me.innerToolStripPanel = objToolStripPanel
        End Sub

        Protected Overrides Function Add(ByVal uiElement As ToolStrip) As ToolStrip
            If Me.innerToolStripPanel Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException()
            End If
            Dim Row As Integer = 2
            ' TODO: work out how to specify row!
            Me.innerToolStripPanel.Join(uiElement, 0)
            Me.innerToolStripPanel.Controls.SetChildIndex(uiElement, NumberOfAddedControls + 1)
            NumberOfAddedControls += 1
            Return uiElement
        End Function

        Protected Overrides Sub Remove(ByVal uiElement As ToolStrip)
            If Me.innerToolStripPanel.Controls.Contains(uiElement) Then
                Me.innerToolStripPanel.Controls.Remove(uiElement)
            End If
        End Sub
    End Class
    ```

    This code registers the top panel, but you can register another or all of them, though only on separate sites. Once you have registered the site, you can create and add `ToolStrips` to it:

    ```vb
    Dim objToolStrip As New System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip
    LocalWorkItem.UIExtensionSites("MainToolStripPanelSiteName").Add(objToolStrip)
    LocalWorkItem.UIExtensionSites.RegisterSite("MyCustomToolStripSitename", objToolStrip)
    ```

    Don't forget the second registration that allows you to add a button to the `ToolStrip`.

    All done! You should now be able to create dynamic tool strips and populate them. If you want to customize commands, you will need to create a command adapter for the `ToolStripPanel` and add it to CAB.

    The easyest way to customise you display of your ToolStrip, MainMenu and StatusBar is to use a custom ColorTable.

    Just inherit from the ProfessionalColorRenderer and override what you want, with the colors you want:

    ```
       1:  Public Class MortgagesPlcColorTable
    ```

    ```
       2:          Inherits ProfessionalColorTable
    ```

    ```
       3:   
    ```

    ```
       4:          Public Overrides ReadOnly Property ButtonCheckedHighlightBorder() As System.Drawing.Color
    ```

    ```
       5:              Get
    ```

    ```
       6:                  Return MyBase.ButtonCheckedHighlightBorder
    ```

    ```
       7:              End Get
    ```

    ```
       8:          End Property
    ```

    ```
       9:   
    ```

    ```
      10:          Public Overrides ReadOnly Property MenuItemPressedGradientMiddle() As System.Drawing.Color
    ```

    ```
      11:              Get
    ```

    ```
      12:                  Return Color.FromArgb(91, 91, 91)
    ```

    ```
      13:              End Get
    ```

    ```
      14:          End Property
    ```

    ```
      15:

    ```
      16:          Public Overrides ReadOnly Property ToolStripContentPanelGradientBegin() As System.Drawing.Color

    ```
      17:              Get
    ```

    ```
      18:                  Return Color.FromArgb(80, 80, 80)

      24:                  Return Color.WhiteSmoke

    ```
      29:              Get
    ```

    ```
      30:                  Return Color.FromArgb(91, 91, 91)
    ```

    ```
      31:              End Get
    ```

    ```
      32:          End Property
    ```

    ```
      33:   
    ```

    ```
      34:          Public Overrides ReadOnly Property ToolStripGradientBegin() As System.Drawing.Color
    ```

    ```
      35:              Get
    ```

    ```
      36:                  Return Color.FromArgb(80, 80, 80)
    ```

    ```
      37:              End Get

    ```

    ```

    ```
      39:   
    ```

    ```
      40:      End Class
    ```

    Once you have done this, all you need now is to add it to your contols:

    ```
       1:          System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripManager.Renderer = New ToolStripProfessionalRenderer(New MortgagesPlc.Windows.Forms.MortgagesPlcColorTable)
    ```

    All done! If you have problems you can inherit from the ToolStrip control and change the renderer in the constructor...
