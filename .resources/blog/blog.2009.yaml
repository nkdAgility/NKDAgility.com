    On the project I am currently working on we want to change the nasty [http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1](http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1) to a nice friendly URL on the website. This is pretty easy and can result in nice URL’s like [http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx](http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx).

    See Also – [Solution - SEO permanent redirects for old URL’s?](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/01/04/do-you-know-how-to-maintain-your-google-ranking-while.aspx)

    Updated #1 January 5th, 2010: \- As suggested by [Adam Cogan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx), I changed the title and added a link to the Solution post.

    ---

    This has already been implemented by the CMS system that we are using, so what is the problem?

    The problem is that Google thinks the URL to “Big Green Teddy Bares from Paris” is [http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1](http://northwind.com/products.aspx?ProductId=1) and we need to tell them that it is now [http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx](http://northwind.com/products/BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis.aspx). The URLs’ are changing for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) reasons, but we do not want to loose any of the raking accumulated over time on the old URL’s.

    We want to use **Rewriting** and not **Routing** because with [rewriting the change is handled before it is passed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/90112/iis-url-rewriting-vs-url-routing) to ASP.NET.

    Rewriting in this case is like _**reverse**_ URL Rewriting and during this process I need to lookup the database to find the new KEY (“BigGreenTeddyBaresFromParis”) and map the URL with the “ProductId” to the new “ProductKey”. If we also return a permanent redirect (301) then Google will learn the new location of the page and keep any ranking data associated with it intact. This is key as we do not want to start from scratch.

    There are two official IIS7 rewrite engines that were recommended to me:

    - URL Rewrite
    - SEO Toolkit

    ## URL Rewrite

    You an install URL Rewrite from the “Web Platform Installer”, and it has very good integration and is easy to configure within IIS. This makes things a lot easier, but does it support 301 redirects?

    [![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_2.png)   
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Adds an option right into the IIS interface

    [![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_4.png)  
    { .post-img }
    Figure: You can easily add new rules through the integrated UI

    [![image](images/HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HelpmerewriteURLstokeepgooglerankings_9B6B-image_6.png)   
    { .post-img }
    Figure: UI supports 301 redirects, but it does not seam to have any way to load from a database.

    Without a way to load from the database there is no way it will solve the problem, and a quick Google shows that it does not support it. The closest it can get is using a key value pair mapping file, but with 30,000 entries I do not think that will perform well.

    If you look at [Developing Rule Template for URL Rewrite Module](http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/519/developing-rule-template-for-url-rewrite-module/ "Developing Rule Template for URL Rewrite Module") you will see that you can only work within the set of options that are provided by the core functionality and can’t create a new feature, like loading the mappings from the database.

    ## SEO Toolkit

    Having looked at the [bumph for the SEO Toolkit](http://www.iis.net/expand/SEOToolkit "SEO Toolkit"), it does not look like it provides any of the functionality required.

    ## Conclusion

    The conclusion is that neither the SEO Toolkit, nor the URL Rewrite Module are of any use in this case. There are now two options, I can roll my own rewriting framework or use another one that already exists that supports extensibility. One such URL rewriting framework that spring to mind is [UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite](http://www.urlrewriting.net "UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite") which I have used before, but it has not been updated since April 2009. I have emailed the guys to ask them is they are still using/ working on it.

    Even though it has not been updated since April 2009, I think this is the best option. The source code is provided on the site, and I am familiar with the component. It supports a rule provider model that will allow me to achieve the goal I am aiming for and is very easy to setup.

    At SSW we are extensive users of Dynamics CRM. I wanted to give Office 2010 a go, but I had to make sure that the Dynamics CRM plug-in, and my other plug-ins worked.

    You would think that support for Office 2010 Beta 2 was poor! You would be right and wrong…

    I use a number of plug-ins for outlook:

    - LinkedIn
    - Plaxo
    - Team Companion
    - Dynamics CRM

    All of them work…to an extent…

    [![Outlook 2010 Beta 2 and Add-In’s: CRM, Team Companion, LinkedIn and Plaxo](images/GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_thumb-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_2.png)   
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Screenshot of outlook with add-ins

    Outlook 2010 put all of the Add-ins into a single tab called “**Add-Ins**” and they just get stacked up, which is bad!

    [![image](images/GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_4.png)  
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Close up of the LinkedIn, Plaxo and Team Companion Add-ins

    Can you see the problem? No? Well, the ribbon bar is only so tall, so that makes for 3 and only 3 add-ins. Where is the Dynamics CRM add-in? Can you see it in the first image? No! Let me help you.

    [![image](images/GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_6.png)   
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Where is Wally Dynamics CRM4 Add-in?

    This looks useless, and it would be if the same options were not also available as a pull down menu.

    [![image](images/GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_8.png)  
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Dynamics CRM4 pull down menu in Office 2010 have all the bits you need, even if you can’t get to the buttons.

    The story is a little better when you open an email. The options for Dynamics CRM are prominent, as are the Team Companion and LinkedIn options.

    [![image](images/GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_thumb_5-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-GotchaCRM4andOutlook2010Beta2_CC89-image_12.png)  
    { .post-img }
    Figure: Shows the Team Companion, LinkedIn and CRM options on an email; this is a much better format.

    So, what else do you need to know? No 64-bit support yet, so you need to use Outlook 32-bit, and if you need to use Outlook 32-bit then you MUST use Office 32-bit:

    1. CRM4 will not Install if Office 2010 is installed  
       Workaround: [http://bovoweb.blogspot.com/2009/10/ms-outlook-2010-and-dynamics-crm.html](http://bit.ly/7SGhlP)
    2. If you upgrade Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2010 CRM will work  
       [http://dario.blog.viadis.hr/2009/07/outlook-2010-dynamics-crm-40-client.html](http://bit.ly/4NDqFe)
    3. You MUST use the 32bit version of Outlook 2010  
       [http://halo76.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/office-2010-and-crm-4-0-for-outlook-32-bit-only/](http://bit.ly/531VZ7)
    4. If you are using Outlook 2010 32bit, the rest of the Office 2010 bits that you install must be of the same bitness  
       [http://blogs.msdn.com/officedevdocs/archive/2009/11/25/developing-outlook-2010-solutions-for-32-bit-and-64-bit-systems.aspx](http://bit.ly/8iJn7N)

    This post also answers the question of wither you can move to Office 64-bit now? The answer is yes, unless you have any add-ins that you depend on and that do not work in Outlook 64-bit. If you do, you are in a bit of a pickle… Wait for support, or better yet, pester the Product team that makes your add-in to get it to support 64-bit office.

    ## To Dynamics CRM Team, Plaxo Team, LinkedIn Team, TeamCompanion Team

    Please can you:

    1. fix add-in to work with Outlook 64-bit (Team Companion guys are already on the case showing the rest of you up)
    2. fix add-in to have a ribbon tab like the Visual Studio ALM Add-in in Excel.

    I have been a cable customer in the UK since day one when it was Cable & Wireless.

    If you don’t know who they are I am not surprised:

    Cable & Wireless –> NTL –> VirginMedia

    I received my first cable modem in 1998 (ish) which was 512 kbs.. much better than ye ole Dial-up, but while ADSL has lagged behind, cable have rocketed up to 50mbs this year.

    With my new job at [SSW](http://bit.ly/5oZrwI "SSW - Sydney's Leading Custom Software Consultants - .NET, SQL Server, Web, Windows and SharePoint and Database Development")[](http://ssw.com.au "SSW - Sydney's Leading Custom Software Consultants - .NET, SQL Server, Web, Windows and SharePoint and Database Development"), I needed a faster internet connection. Ever since I moved house 5 years ago it has been a little slow, so I opted for Virgins 50mbit.

    Now I thought it would be fast, but OMG:

    [![image](images/Speed_A1AE-image_thumb-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Speed_A1AE-image_2.png)

    I just downloaded Project 2010 in under 3 minutes… Did you notice the important figure in the image above?

    Transfer Rate: 3.201 MB/sec

    That's not megabit! that's Megabyte"!

    Here is the speed in your flavour of choice:  
    \=**25.608** Mbps \[Megabit-per-second\]  
    \=**25608** Kbps \[Kilobit-per-second\]  
    \=**3.201** MB/sec \[Megabyte-per-second\]  
    \=**3201** KB/sec \[Kilobyte-per-second\]

    [](http://www.mediaroad.com/products/speedcheck/free_tools/unit_convert/ "http://www.mediaroad.com/products/speedcheck/free_tools/unit_convert/")[http://www.mediaroad.com/products/speedcheck/free_tools/unit_convert/](http://bit.ly/5QF2HG "http://www.mediaroad.com/products/speedcheck/free_tools/unit_convert/")

    And that's not the fastest it was ripping Project from the Microsoft site, it was just the speed when my PrtScr kicked in… it was up around the 4.xx mark!

    **We have come a long way since 56k in such a short time, and I am loving it….**

    **(Update 06/12/2009)**

    **Before upgrade (was on 20mbs):**

    Previously I created this [the manual way](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/12/07/create-a-vhd-from-the-windows-7-image-disk.aspx), but if you have a fast internet connection and can take the 1.6gb download of the AIK, then this is a much easier way of getting started.

    This is not really the same as the SSW image that I created before, the SSW image was a lovely slipstreamed beauty with all the application I would ever need already preinstalled.. It was 32GB and took a very long time to setup. This will be sum what faster as it  only require a base Windows Server 2008 Setup…

    1. Download [Windows® Automated Installation Kit (AIK)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=696dd665-9f76-4177-a811-39c26d3b3b34)

       Figure: Unpack using WinRAR, don’t burn it as it is a waste of a DVD. Some applications don’t like being run from a Virtual DVD.
    2. Install  the AIK onto your local computer.

       Figure: Weird setup, but what the heck…

       Figure: Its just a script file that you download. I would prefer if it was a command line app with an optional UI, but you can’t have everything.
    4. Mount your Windows 2008 R2 image to a Virtual DVD drive. I am using Virtual Clone Drive.

    You now have a lovely Out Of Box Windows 2008 R2 VHD. I would keep a copy of this in a nice safe place so you don’t need that coffee break every time.

    Whoa there… not so fast..

    Did you spot my mistake?

    Could it be to do with the little “SERVERSTANDARDCORE” tag?

    Could it be the “CORE” bit?

    I think so.. I was just wondering why my resultant VHD was only 2.5gb in size!

    Doh!

    Lets try that properly:

    This being my first week at [SSW](http://ssw.com.au "SSW - Sydney's Leading Custom Software Consultants - .NET, SQL Server, Web, Windows and SharePoint and Database Development"), and still waiting for my nice shiny new laptop to arrive, I am sitting here at my Wife’s laptop (which is PINK, a requirement to keep the [WAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_acceptance_factor) high), until it arrives.

    [![image](images/ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_thumb_7-13-13.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_16.png)

    { .post-img }
    Figure: I know its nearly Christmas, but that's a long time between order and delivery!

    SSW have sent me a .wim (Windows Image) file in the post and I really want to get a look at it before my new computer arrives.

    In order to be able to create a clean install very quickly we need to convert this to a Windows 7 VHD. This way when the new computer arrives we can just move it over :) I also want to be able to reinstall my computer quickly. And what is quicker then mounting a new VHD and rebooting.

    In order to achieve this there are a number of things that need done:

    1.  **Copy all of the .rar files from the DVD’s** ![coffee-cup](images/ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-coffee-cup_3-1-1.jpg)  
        { .post-img }

        { .post-img }
        Figure: Third disk is taking a while

    2.  **Use WinRar to fit the 3 packages back together**  
         [![image](images/ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_thumb_2-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_6.png)  
        { .post-img }
        Figure: Joining the wim file together is going to take a while as well. I don’t want to have to do this more than once!

    3.  **Create a new VHD  
         **[![image](images/ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_thumb_3-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ConvertSSW.WIMimagetoVHD_AAC5-image_8.png)

        { .post-img }
        In order to do this you will need [imageX](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722145(WS.10).aspx>) from the [Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=696DD665-9F76-4177-A811-39C26D3B3B34&displaylang=en). Check [http://blogs.technet.com/aviraj/archive/2009/01/18/windows-7-boot-from-vhd-first-impression-part-2.aspx](http://blogs.technet.com/aviraj/archive/2009/01/18/windows-7-boot-from-vhd-first-impression-part-2.aspx "http://blogs.technet.com/aviraj/archive/2009/01/18/windows-7-boot-from-vhd-first-impression-part-2.aspx") for more details and scenarios that will suit you.  
         note: You may look at the [Windows(R) Image to Virtual Hard Disk (WIM2VHD) Converter](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wim2vhd) as another solution, but it requires that the Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit be installed locally, where I just downloaded imageX separately and bypassed the 1gb download.

        { .post-img }
        Figure: All done, I don’t know how long it took because I got on with some other things, but it was a while!

    5.  Detach the VHD

        Figure: This will allow me to save ssw.vhd for a rainy day, and use the copy as a working install.

         C:>bcdedit /set <guid> device vhd=\[driveletter:\]<directory><vhd filename>  
         C:>bcdedit /set <guid> osdevice vhd=\[driverletter:\]<directory><vhd filename>  
         C:>bcdedit /set <guid> detecthal on

        { .post-img }
        Figure: Added and configured the new Image…lets try it out…

    Although this took a long time with 3 long running processes, it will be a lot faster next time as I can start from step #9…

    I have been trying since SP1 was released to get it installed at Aggreko, but due to our global, three time zones, development team and release schedules it has been very difficult to get some time set aside for it.

    Now that I am leaving, last day is Tuesday 17th November, there was more of an apatite to take the hit on time and get it installed.

    While I may be late to the game for SP1, I was conscious that a lot of gotchas around the installation had been reported when it was released.

    You can find a full list on [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry)'s blog on his [Problems installing TFS SP1 post](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx), but I have to say that I have never had an install, except maybe 2010, go more smoothly. Its always the same when you take lots of precautions for Murphy's Law to rear its head, nothing goes wrong ;).

    We have a single virtual server instance of TFS with the only architectural customisation is the link between TFS and our corporate MOSS environment.

    ### Release Plan

    1. Turn off remote access to TFS websites  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-6-6.png)
       { .post-img }
    2. Verify access to TFS is not possible remotely  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-7-7.png)
       { .post-img }
    3. Run full SQL backup  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-8-8.png)
       { .post-img }
    4. Take a snapshot (VM Ware) of the TFS server \[Infrastructure Team\]
    5. Install VS2008 SP1 if client installed  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-1-1.png)
       { .post-img }
    6. Install TFS2008 Service Pack 1  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-4-4.png)If any problems are encountered refer to Brian Harry’s post on resolving SP1 install issues: [http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/comments/1627061.aspx)
       { .post-img }
    7. Follow test plan
    8. If tests fail, follow back out plan
    9. Done

    ### Test Plan

    1. Check event log for errors  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-9-9.png)
       { .post-img }
    2. Check all services are running  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-2-2.png)
       { .post-img }
    3. Test web access  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-3-3.png)
       { .post-img }
    4. Test Visual Studio Access  
        ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamFoundation_95A1-image_-5-5.png)
       { .post-img }

    ### Back out Plan

    1\. Restore last snapshot

    2\. Start TFS website in IIS

    3\. Test TFS Services by connecting through Visual Studio 2005 / 2008

    4\. Test Web Access ([http://tfs01.northwind.com](http://tfs01.northwind.com))

    ### Conclusion

    Although there seemed to be a lot of noise around the time that SP1 was released, the great god Murphy left me alone in this instance. It just goes to show, simpler is better...

    Its "Dyslexia Awareness Week" here in the UK, and as a person that benefits from being a [Dyslexic developer](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/Tags/dyslexia/default.aspx), I thought I should highlight the specific strengths to programmers of being dyslexic...

    All of the benefits are due to a neurological difference that presents as a larger right-hemisphere in the brain and many more neural connections are formed than is normally found. While this can make it difficult for others to follow the actual thought process the benefits outweigh the cost of this and the random symbol orientation problems that most dyslexic people suffer from:

    - 3-D visualization ability
    - creative problem solving skills
    - intuitive people skills
    - visually interpreting information in 3d while applying a 4th dimension, reasoning. (e.g. value, logic, action, purpose, possibility, personality, emotion, sentiment and action, etc.)

    If only our education systems would take advantage of these differences...

    Well, nothing like hitting the ground running, my first job at SSW was to join the TFS Migration Team, it was a fun experience, let me tell you how it went.

    Update #1 20th January 2010: Have a look at our [Rules to better TFS2010 Migration](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/TFS/RulesToBetterTFS2010Migration/Pages/default.aspx)

    ---

    Adam put a few guys together:

    - [Adam Cogan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx) (Australia) – The team lead who checks everything and makes us follow the [rules to better TFS](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx).
    - [Eric Phan](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Eric.aspx) (Australia) – Created an excellent "Rules to a successful migration from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010 guide”
    - [Justin King](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Justin.aspx) (Australia) – Justin seems to play the part of devil’s advocate. I looked him up in the company directory and he is a previous employee…I guess you never really leave SSW.
    - Me (Scotland) – The implementer
    - [Allan Zhou](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Allan.aspx) (Beijing) – My co-conspirator for the implementation

    We started at 2:30am (GMT+1) on Saturday morning and we did it in 5 major steps:

    1. Backed up TFS 2008 databases (Some 14GB of data)
    2. Restored databases to new 64 bit server
    3. Installed TFS 2010 Beta 2 64 bit
    4. Run the Upgrade of 2008 data to 2010 Beta 2
    5. Tested the deployment

    We completed the migration at 9:15am (GMT+1) on Saturday morning so all in the migration took just less than 7 hours.

    Well done to the SSW team.

    Well done also to the guys involved in the TFS team, the same migration from TFS 2005 to TFS 2008 was a much more painful experience taking days of work, but the guys from SSW made this process easy and straight forward…Preparation does that for a project…

    A possible claim to fame: In addition we might have been the first company (SSW is a company of 52 employees and contractors) to migrate. So far I have not seen any blog posts about other companies migrating everything over to Beta 2. I am a TFS MVP and no-one on that list has posted about a migration yet (I can just imagine Justin King having another fit when he finds that out).

    In the last 2+ years at Aggreko I have worked with Visual Studio 2008 Team Foundation Server, Office SharePoint Server 2007 and a number of WPF, Silverlight and ASP.NET projects.

    There had been some discussion of a new role within [Aggreko](http://bit.ly/8RqEwt) in the solution architecture arena. I also spoke to [Adam Cogan](http://bit.ly/6jCYnH) who has the title “SSW Chief Architect and Microsoft Regional Director”…

    This fortuitous communication, which turned into an interview, resulted in an offer from Adam Cogan of employment as a Senior Software Architect at [SSW](http://bit.ly/5oZrwI)…

    I got through the interview and I decided to take a role at SSW…

    [![SSWLogo](images/Rulestobetteremployment_14DEF-SSWLogo_3-2-3.png)](http://bit.ly/5oZrwI)
    { .post-img }

    If you know of Adam, then you will know that he has [rules and standards](http://bit.ly/8ao5oP) for everything. If you have not heard of him, then I suggest that you have a read of those rules and see what they are all about.

    The first set of rules that I read was the [Rules to better Email](http://bit.ly/75PYS9) and they helped me be more productive even before I accepted the job…

    Check out rule [#32](http://bit.ly/67SSH9) in SSW’s “[Rules To Being Software Consultants Working In A Team](http://bit.ly/67SSH9)”

    > #### _#32 Do you enjoy your job?_
    >
    > _The expectation from Adam is:_
    >
    > - _#1 is to put your heart into your job and enjoy yourself_
    > - _Get your Employee Responsibilities (Scheduled recurring events) done_
    > - _Improve SSW to a better place every week_
    > - _Improve yourself to better person every week_
    >
    > _If you find yourself not enjoying your job this is not necessarily a bad thing. You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have decided you are unhappy you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making you unhappy. The fact is that there are some jobs that you are not suited to. It is probably best for everyone that you start to think about moving on and trying something that may make you happier._

    I totally agree with this and at Aggreko I was supported by many people. I spoke to my boss Andre Vermeulen about the things I was not happy with, and we came to an understanding, but it is difficult for a large company to move at the same pace that I do. I found working with SharePoint 2003 is really just unacceptable.

    In my new role at SSW I will be tasked with:

    - bringing SSW’s rules to European clients
    - helping organisations be more proactive with the Visual Studio 2010 ALM offering,
    - migrating TFS 2005 and TFS 2008 customers to the joys of TFS 2010
    - enabling SSW to have 24 hour operations

    On top of this I will be using SharePoint 2010 and CRM 2005 in order to implement intranets and CRM for clients.

    Its going to be a fun ride, and if you want to take your company to the next step and you are in Europe, please contact me.

    If you get a chance, check out SSW’s Rules. I am sure you will find something that will make you more productive and happier…

    I was recently contacted by [Colin Mackay](http://www.colinmackay.net/), the chairman of [Scottish Developers](http://scottishdevelopers.com) about doing an interview with them. Colin has been pestering me for a while now to do some speaking engagements, but I am still not comfortable with that! (Yes, I am too chicken), so I capitulated…

    My [interview](http://scottishdevelopers.com/2009/10/19/october-newsletter/) appears in the October edition of their [newsletter](http://scottishdevelopers.com/2009/10/19/october-newsletter/) and although I think I rambled a little, understatement of the year, I do think I came across ok, if a little scatter brained…

    New in Visual Studio 2010 is the ability to install TFS on XP, Vista and Windows 7. You can use SQL 2008 Express, so no large overhead, and the Basic version you use for this does have the reporting and SharePoint requirement that the main install does. That does not mean that you can't upgrade later :)

    ![image](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamFoundation_B5ED-image_-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    Once you have TFS2010 installed you will need to [configure](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/10/20/configuring-visual-studio-2010-team-foundation-server-on-vista-in.aspx) it...

    New logo, new install. Microsoft have changed the, lets face it, horrible install, and split it into two separate pieces. Install and Configuration.

    First The Install: The only options are wither you install server and build... nice...

    { .post-img }

    Total install time: 3 minutes (which includes the time to take these screenshots and save them)

    Now that I have TFS2010 installed I will need to [configure](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/10/20/configuring-visual-studio-2010-team-foundation-server-on-vista-in.aspx) it...

    As Microsoft have separated Install with configuration, so I have separated my posts! You will need TFS2010 [installed](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/10/20/configuring-visual-studio-2010-team-foundation-server-on-vista-in.aspx) prior to the steps below.

    ![clip_image001](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-clip_image001_-1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    This is my configuration experience...This wizard is excellent. If you had ever tried to install TFS in the past and it taken you a long time (took me 7 days the first time in 2005) Then you need to give this a go...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-10-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can pick basic and it is...well...basic. It will install everything to the defaults.

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-3-10.png)
    { .post-img }

    I'm picking Advanced because I want to be able to select a pre-existing SQL Express instance...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Install](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-13-5.png)
    { .post-img }

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Database](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-12-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can enter a label if you want to have more than one TFS Configuration database in the same SQL instance.

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Account](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-11-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you are wanting to run on a network, maybe with an externally accessible URL, then you may need to pay attention to the security, but I don't really care for this install... ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Application Tier](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-6-13.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you want to ever be able to connect Visual Studio 2005 clients to the server you MUST remove the virtual directory as Team Explorer 2005 will not be able to anything but the default collection.

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Project Collection](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-7-14.png)
    { .post-img }

    Ok, I have a default collection, but only because I am lazy...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Review](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-4-11.png) All done, now to apply it.
    { .post-img }

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Rediness Checks](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-9-16.png)
    { .post-img }

    No, wait, we need to check all of the system requirements!

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-5-12.png)
    { .post-img }

    Now, usually this is the time to break out a cup of team, and maybe have a siesta. Lets see how long it takes...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure after 20 seconds](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-15-7.png)
    { .post-img }

    ..30 seconds...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure after 40 seconds](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-14-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    ...50 seconds...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure after 50 seconds](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-8-15.png)
    { .post-img }

    .. 1 minute...

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure after 60 seconds](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-2-9.png)
    { .post-img }

    ..Whoa, that was less than 2 minutes for the whole process.

    ![Team Foundation Server Configuration - Advanced - Configure - Complete](images/8c502b9afabd_C17A-image_-16-8.png) Just to prove that this whole process took less than 12 minutes, here is the beginning and end of the log file:

    Whoa, that was fast! Compared to previous versions I was done before I started, like crossing an international date line. Another one is... no documentation... nope, I didn't look at it once! I would not recommend this approach, at least have a look to make sure you are installing the correct version on the correct URL's and to learn what the terms are.

    P.S. Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 any version without the Team Foundation Server 2010 compatibility pack WILL NOT CONNECT! The [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Service Pack 1 Forward Compatibility Update for Team Foundation Server 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d) is [available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d), but 2005 will not be available until RTM.

    [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Service Pack 1 Forward Compatibility Update for Team Foundation Server 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=cf13ea45-d17b-4edc-8e6c-6c5b208ec54d)

    I should note that you should not complain about the limited support for 2005. Microsoft expects the install base to be less than 5% by the time Visual Studio 2010 is released, and they were not going to support it at all. That there is any support at all is due to the lobbying of the Team System MVP community and TAP customers and excelent communication with the product teams...

    Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 is now available on MSDN for download!

    [![clip_image001](images/VisualStudio2010Beta2isavailableNow_10BF1-clip_image001_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-VisualStudio2010Beta2isavailableNow_10BF1-clip_image001_2.png)

    With 2010 comes new SKU's. Microsoft is trying to simplify the layout and features that you can get.

    Visual Studio IDE now comes in these flavours:

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2010 Professional

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2010 Professional with MSDN

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2010 Premium with MSDN

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2010 Ultimate with MSDN

    [![clip_image002](images/VisualStudio2010Beta2isavailableNow_10BF1-clip_image002_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-VisualStudio2010Beta2isavailableNow_10BF1-clip_image002_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    So no Team Edition, and bits of Team Suit has been split between Premium and Ultimate. I addition all of the editions above will include a Team Foundation Server CAL which will make licensing a lot simpler.

    Although Premium and Ultimate will continue to be in the ALM space there are also other elements like the Test Elements and Lab management that are new for 2010 that also sit in this space with Team Foundation Server.

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® Test Elements 2010 with MSDN

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® Team Foundation Server 2010

    · Microsoft® Visual Studio® Team Lab Management 2010

    If you have not already heard there will be a [Team Foundation Server Express](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/10/01/tfs-2010-for-sourcesafe-users.aspx) product that is able to be installed on Vista and Windows 7.

    Although this post is called Scale Transform Behaviour you could use any transform / animation in its place. The purpose is to have a slider control in a menu be able to alter the scale of any number of controls within [MVVM](http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/the-philosophies-of-mvvm/) views.

    ![image](images/WpfScaleTransformBehaviour_7143-image_-2-2.png)

    This behaviour allows you to add any Framework Elements to a list of attached controls by adding an attached property of GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaled to your controls.

    ```
    Public Class GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour

        Private Shared sm_AttachedControls As List(Of FrameworkElement)
        Public Shared ReadOnly IsScaledProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached("IsScaled", GetType(Boolean), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(False, New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaledChanged)))
        Private Shared sm_CurrentScale As Double = 1

        Shared Sub New()
            sm_AttachedControls = New List(Of FrameworkElement)
        End Sub

        Public Shared Function GetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Boolean
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If

            Return element.GetValue(IsScaledProperty)
        End Function

        Public Shared Sub SetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Boolean)
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If
            element.SetValue(IsScaledProperty, value)
        End Sub

        Private Shared Sub IsScaledChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)
            Dim itemToResize As FrameworkElement = TryCast(obj, FrameworkElement)
            If (Not itemToResize Is Nothing) Then
                If Object.Equals(e.NewValue, True) Then
                    sm_AttachedControls.Add(itemToResize)
                    itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)
                Else
                    sm_AttachedControls.Remove(itemToResize)
                    itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(1, 1)
                End If
            End If
        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    As you can see, there is an attached dependency Boolean property defined with a PropertyChangedCallback. When the PropertyChangedCallback method is called we test to see if it is a True or False value and either add the control to a static list and set the current Transform, or remove the control from the list and reset the transform to 1.

    This works grate and you can manipulate the list of controls at runtime by changing the dependency property.

    ```

    There is quite a lot of Wpf here, so I have highlighted the DockPanel to which the dependency has been applied. All we now need to do is provide a way to manipulate this value. We need to add a ScaleValue attached dependency property to our Behaviour that we can bind to our single or set of control controls.

    ```
    Public Class GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour

        Private Shared sm_AttachedControls As List(Of FrameworkElement)
        Public Shared ReadOnly IsScaledProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached("IsScaled", GetType(Boolean), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(False, New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.IsScaledChanged)))
        Public Shared ReadOnly ScaleValueProperty As DependencyProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached("ScaleValue", GetType(Double), GetType(GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour), New UIPropertyMetadata(CType(1, Double), New PropertyChangedCallback(AddressOf GlobalScaleTransformBehaviour.ScaleValueChanged)))
        Private Shared sm_CurrentScale As Double = 1

        Shared Sub New()
            sm_AttachedControls = New List(Of FrameworkElement)
        End Sub

        Public Shared Function GetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Boolean
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If

            Return element.GetValue(IsScaledProperty)
        End Function

        Public Shared Sub SetIsScaled(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Boolean)
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If
            element.SetValue(IsScaledProperty, value)
        End Sub

        Private Shared Sub IsScaledChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)
            Dim itemToResize As FrameworkElement = TryCast(obj, FrameworkElement)
            If (Not itemToResize Is Nothing) Then
                If Object.Equals(e.NewValue, True) Then
                    sm_AttachedControls.Add(itemToResize)
                    itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)
                Else
                    sm_AttachedControls.Remove(itemToResize)
                    itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(1, 1)
                End If
            End If
        End Sub

        Public Shared Function GetScaleValue(ByVal element As DependencyObject) As Double
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If

            Return element.GetValue(ScaleValueProperty)
        End Function

        Public Shared Sub SetScaleValue(ByVal element As DependencyObject, ByVal value As Double)
            If element Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException("element")
            End If
            element.SetValue(ScaleValueProperty, value)
        End Sub

        Private Shared Sub ScaleValueChanged(ByVal obj As DependencyObject, ByVal e As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)
            If Not Application.Current.Dispatcher.CheckAccess Then
                Exit Sub
            End If
            sm_CurrentScale = e.NewValue
            SyncLock sm_AttachedControls
                For Each itemToResize In sm_AttachedControls.ToList
                    ' Apply Tensform
                    itemToResize.LayoutTransform = New ScaleTransform(sm_CurrentScale, sm_CurrentScale)
                Next
            End SyncLock
        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    This value is stored so we can set new controls, and then applied to all of the currently attached controls. I have chosen to bind to a slider, but any way of passing in the required values is just fine.

    As you can see I am heavily utilizing the Infragistics controls, but that would not affect this procedure. The result is the ability to smoothly scale your controls based on a global scale setting.

    You have probably heard me go on about Unity a couple of times:

    - [My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/my.unity.resolveof-ninja.aspx)
    - [Unity and ASP.NET](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/unity-and-asp.net.aspx)
    - [Creating a Data Access layer using Unity](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/07/30/creating-a-data-access-layer-using-unity.aspx)

    I have been using what is now [unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity) since the good old days (sooo not true, WPF is the Windows Forms killer, and good riddance) of WindowsForms and CAB (Client Application Block), but now there is a lightweight alternative: [Ninject](http://ninject.org).

    I decided on my latest project (a Wpf dashboard for HEAT ITSM) that I needed dependency injection. Whenever I start building a [MVVM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx) project I always end up needing some sort of dependency injection to keep everything nice and neat. It is only really needed once you get to a certain size and when you start wanting talk between [ViewModels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel).

    Anyway I was using a method of injecting my ViewModels into the Views using standard binding:

    ```
    <igDock:ContentPane x:Class="SlaTodayView"
        xmlns:igDP="http://infragistics.com/DataPresenter"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfHeatItsmDashboard"
        xmlns:igWindows="http://infragistics.com/Windows"
        xmlns:igDock="http://infragistics.com/DockManager"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Header="Sla Today" MinWidth="30" MinHeight="50">
        <igDock:ContentPane.Resources>
            <ObjectDataProvider
            x:Key="ViewModel"
            ObjectType="{x:Type local:SlaTodayViewModel}"
            />
        </igDock:ContentPane.Resources>
        <igDP:XamDataGrid DataContext="{StaticResource ViewModel}" DataSource="{Binding Calls}" Theme="Office2k7Black" >

        </igDP:XamDataGrid>
    </igDock:ContentPane>
    ```

    But once you move to dependency injection you do not want to keep all those fixed object definitions. These may become interfaces, or you may just want to replace, or dynamically replace, one of these types by a derived one at runtime.

    That being the goal, we need some way to retrieve that type even in design mode. There is nothing worse than components or bits of components that make it difficult to work in both Visual Studio and Blend, and with the new binding features of Visual Studio 2010 for WPF 4 it will be even more important that your usage is as compatible as possible.

    What I decided to do was create a custom [DataSourceProvider,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.datasourceprovider.aspx) called the NinjectDataProvider that I could use instead of the ObjectDataProvider. This is the first version of that provider and it does nothing more than retrieve the type form the [Ninject](http://ninject.org) Kernel. Minimal changes to the WPF enable this:

    ```
    <igDock:ContentPane x:Class="SlaTodayView"
        xmlns:igDP="http://infragistics.com/DataPresenter"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfHeatItsmDashboard"
        xmlns:igWindows="http://infragistics.com/Windows"
        xmlns:igDock="http://infragistics.com/DockManager"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Header="Sla Today" MinWidth="30" MinHeight="50">
        <igDock:ContentPane.Resources>
            <local:NinjectDataProvider
            x:Key="ViewModel"
            ObjectType="{x:Type local:SlaTodayViewModel}"
            />
        </igDock:ContentPane.Resources>
        <igDP:XamDataGrid DataContext="{StaticResource ViewModel}" DataSource="{Binding Calls}" Theme="Office2k7Black" >

        </igDP:XamDataGrid>
    </igDock:ContentPane>
    ```

    As you can see, the only difference is highlighted above and shows the custom [DataSourceProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.datasourceprovider.aspx) in action.

    ![image](images/WpfNinjectDojoTheDataProvider_C6CF-image_-2-2.png)  You can see from the image above that the designer capability is not affected with this actually loading from the database, nice!
    { .post-img }

    So, what do we need to do to achieve this marvellous result. its actialy fairly simple, I got out my trusty [reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/) and found that there is really only one method to override.

    ```
    Imports System.ComponentModel
    Imports System.Threading

    Public Class NinjectDataProvider
        Inherits DataSourceProvider

        Private m_objectType As Type

        Public Property ObjectType() As Type
            Get
                Return Me.m_objectType
            End Get
            Set(ByVal value As Type)
                If Not m_objectType Is value Then
                    m_objectType = value
                    Me.OnPropertyChanged("ObjectType")
                    If Not MyBase.IsRefreshDeferred Then
                        MyBase.Refresh()
                    End If
                End If
            End Set
        End Property

        Private Overloads Sub OnPropertyChanged(ByVal propertyName As String)
            MyBase.OnPropertyChanged(New PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName))
        End Sub

        Protected Overrides Sub BeginQuery()
            If m_objectType Is Nothing Then
                Me.OnQueryFinished(Nothing, New InvalidOperationException("You must provide an ObjectType"), Nothing, Nothing)
            End If
            Dim result As Object
            Try
                result = Application.NinjectKernel.Get(m_objectType)
                Me.OnQueryFinished(result, Nothing, Nothing, Nothing)
            Catch ex As Exception
                Me.OnQueryFinished(Nothing, ex, Nothing, Nothing)
            End Try
        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    I do not yet need all the fancy features of [Ninject](http://ninject.org) yet so I have only implemented the bit that I need at the moment. If I am adding more (and get it working) I will blog about it in the future.

    To get this working I needed to add an instance of an IKernel object to the “Application” file so I have a single Kernel instance through my application unless I want another, but this is a small price to pay and it could well have been done in the same way as the [My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/05/08/my.unity.resolveof-ninja.aspx) post I did on [Unity](http://www.codeplex.com/unity).

It is concise without being boring and it provides a wealth of information on Silverlight 3.
    { .post-img }

    And it is in Colour! I never would have thought that this would make such a difference, I don’t really know why I thought this as I hate looking at code in notepad, but it makes it much easier to read the code pages, both c#/vb and xaml.

    Because I have been using WPF for a number of years this book is perfect for me, although this is a reference book, It has a nice layout that is conducive to both learning and reference.

    Will I be hanging up my WPF hat and replacing it with a Silverlight one? Well, no… but Silverlight 3 is a big step forward…

    I had previously created a Command Line Parser from [Ray Hayes](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=7917) codeproject article [Automatic Command Line Parsing in C#](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/commandlineparser.aspx). I had adapted it to VB.NET and upgraded it to .NET 3.5 but I recently ran into the problem with wanting a single command prompt application to handle multiple processes and multiple parameters. This would allow you to group all of a particular tasks commands into a single application. With the advent of Power Shell this format is increasingly less relevant, but with the proliferation of Power Shell many people still prefer to use the good old command line.

    So, staring from the original [Command Line Parser v1.0](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=28451) code I wanted to be able to add multiple commands, or even nest commands. The result is a nice simple commanding architecture conducive to creating multiple commands.

    [![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_thumb_1-1-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Using this model I can create a simple command…

    ```
    Imports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser
    Imports System.IO
    Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel
    Imports System.Net

    Public Class Demo1Command
        Inherits CommandBase(Of Demo1CommandLine)

        Private m_PortalLocation As Uri

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Description() As String
            Get
                Return "demo 1 command demonstrates a sinle nested command"
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Name() As String
            Get
                Return "Demo1"
            End Get
        End Property

        Protected Overrides Function ValidateCommand() As Boolean
            Return True
        End Function

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Title() As String
            Get
                Return "demo 1"
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Synopsis() As String
            Get
                Return "demo 1 command"
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Switches() As ReadOnlyCollection(Of SwitchInfo)
            Get
                Return CommandLine.Switches
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Qualifications() As String
            Get
                Return String.Empty
            End Get
        End Property

        Protected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer
            Try
                CommandOut.Warning("running Demo1")
                Return -1
            Catch ex As Exception
                CommandOut.Error("Failed: {0}", ex.ToString)
                Return -1
            End Try
        End Function

    End Class
    ```

    Or something more substantial:

    ```
    Protected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer
        Try
            Dim x As New Proxies.MyApp.Configuration.ConfigurationServiceClient("BasicHttpBinding_IConfigurationService", m_PortalLocation.ToString)
            x.ClientCredentials.Windows.AllowedImpersonationLevel = System.Security.Principal.TokenImpersonationLevel.Delegation
            Select Case CommandLine.Action
                Case QuiesceAction.Offline
                    x.QuiesceSource(CommandLine.Source, CommandLine.Message, New TimeSpan(0))
                Case QuiesceAction.Online
                    x.RestoreSource(CommandLine.Source)
            End Select
            CommandOut.Info("Source {0} has been made {1}", CommandLine.Source, CommandLine.Action.ToString)
            Return 0

        Catch ex As EndpointNotFoundException
            CommandOut.Error("Unable to locate site. Check the value you selected for /Portal:{0}", CommandLine.Portal)
            Return -1
        Catch ex As Exception
            CommandOut.Error("Failed: {0}", ex.ToString)
            Return -1
        End Try
    End Function
    ```

    If you are wondering where the variables come from, you can see form Demo1Command that a generic type of Demo1CommandLine is passed in. The application creates an instance of this which wraps the [Ray Hayes](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=7917) parser to provide the values from Environment.CommandLine used on the shared methods on the CommandLineBase class.

    ```
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Created a command line object using the Environment.CommandLine information
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <typeparam name="TCommandLine">The concrete type of object to create</typeparam>
    ''' <returns>An instance of the object</returns>
    ''' <remarks></remarks>
    Public Shared Function CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})() As TCommandLine
        Return CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine)(Environment.CommandLine)
    End Function

    ''' <summary>
    ''' Created a command line object using the Environment.CommandLine information
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <typeparam name="TCommandLine">The concrete type of object to create</typeparam>
    ''' <param name="CommandLine">The command line arguments to parse</param>
    ''' <returns></returns>
    ''' <remarks></remarks>
    Public Shared Function CreateCommandLine(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})(ByVal CommandLine As String) As TCommandLine
        Dim instance As New TCommandLine
        Dim parser As New Parser(CommandLine, instance)
        parser.Parse()
        instance.Parser = parser
        Return instance
    End Function
    ```

    This parser then populates the CommandLine object with values from the CommandLine passed in. For example:

    ```
    Imports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser
    Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel

    Public Class Demo3CommandLine
        Inherits CommandLineBase

        Private m_value1 As String
        Private m_value2 As Value2Values = Value2Values.Value1

        <CommandLineSwitch("Value1", "Adds a string value named value1"), CommandLineAlias("v1")> _
        Public Property Value1() As String
            Get
                Return Me.m_value1
            End Get
            Set(ByVal value As String)
                Me.m_value1 = value
            End Set
        End Property

        <CommandLineSwitch("Value2", "Adds and enum value called value2"), CommandLineAlias("v2")> _
        Public Property Value2() As Value2Values
            Get
                Return Me.m_value2
            End Get
            Set(ByVal value As Value2Values)
                Me.m_value2 = value
            End Set
        End Property

        Public Enum Value2Values
            Enum1
            Enum2
            Enum3
        End Enum

    End Class
    ```

    Would allow you to call \[consoleApp\] Demo3 /v1:”Any value you like” /Value2:Enum3 and have the correct values populated at runtime.

    I have also updated with a DelegateCommand class that would allow you to call a function in the right format from anywhere:

    ```
    New DelegateCommand(Of Demo3CommandLine)("Demo2", AddressOf OnDemo2Run, "demo 2", "no additional information", "demo 2 command", "This command shows how to delegate the run method using the delegate command")
    ```

    The delegate command is really easy in .NET 3.5 with the only change being the addition of a variable declared as a Func in the class:

    ```
    Imports Hinshlabs.CommandLineParser
    Imports System.IO
    Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel
    Imports System.Net

    Public Class DelegateCommand(Of TCommandLine As {New, CommandLineBase})
        Inherits CommandBase(Of TCommandLine)

        Private m_Description As String
        Private m_Title As String
        Private m_Synopsis As String
        Private m_Qualifications As String
        Private m_name As String
        Private m_RunCommand As Func(Of Integer)

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Description() As String
            Get
                Return m_Description
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Name() As String
            Get
                Return m_name
            End Get
        End Property

        Protected Overrides Function RunCommand() As Integer
            Try
                Return m_RunCommand.Invoke
            Catch ex As Exception
                CommandOut.Error("Failed: {0}", ex.ToString)
                Return -1
            End Try
        End Function

        Protected Overrides Function ValidateCommand() As Boolean
            Return True
        End Function

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Title() As String
            Get
                Return m_title
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Synopsis() As String
            Get
                Return Synopsis
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Switches() As ReadOnlyCollection(Of SwitchInfo)
            Get
                Return CommandLine.Switches
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Overrides ReadOnly Property Qualifications() As String
            Get
                Return String.Empty
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Sub New(ByVal name As String, ByVal runCommand As Func(Of Integer), ByVal title As String, ByVal qualifications As String, ByVal synopsis As String, ByVal description As String)
            m_name = name
            m_RunCommand = runCommand
            m_Title = title
            m_Qualifications = qualifications
            m_Synopsis = synopsis
            m_Description = description
        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    If you were wondering why there are so many properties, it is to allow the help to be created automatically. For example if you call the help function on Demo3Command you will get…

    ![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_-3-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    With the values coming from the relevant places:

    ![image](images/UpdatingtheCommandLineParser_AC5D-image_-4-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    It will also support inherited CommandLine objects to minimize duplication.

    I hope that if you are building command line apps that you will have a look, just remember not to spend too much effort on cmd, when Power Shell is much more suitable and accessible to non developers.

  BodyContent: |
    A colleague of mine was having a bit of trouble getting drag and drop working in a way that fitted well with the MVVM pattern. This is really quite simple once you have a certain level of understanding of Patterns, but is a complete nightmare if you do not.

    One of the founding principals of MVVM is that you should never be writing code in your code behind, it should all be encapsulated away and be bindable in XAML to achieve the result. Anyone who has tackled drag and drip will have suddenly found their code behind covered in code for handling both the drag and the drop, and multiplied up when dealing with multiple controls.

    I cruised the web for information, of which I found plenty and settled on an example by [Bea Stollnitz](http://www.beacosta.com "Bea Stollnitz on Silverlight and WPF") of Microsoft. In her [post](http://www.beacosta.com/blog/?p=53 "How can I drag and drop items between data bound ItemsControls?") i had found one of the best and most intuitive examples of the Drag & Drop Behaviour written in C#.

    I am not going to go into all of her code which she has available for download, just to say that it is nice, and is exactly what I am looking for even with the limitations that she described.

    The functionality available allows you to drag a piece of data from one ItemsControl to another of the same data type or to reorder within itself. It provides for a floating template for the dragging item and a visual cue for the drop location.

    ![InsertionAdorner](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-InsertionAdorner_3-4-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    I wanted to augment this to allow for other scenarios while keeping as much functionality as possible.

    Likes:

    - Drag functionality
    - Drag templating – nice!
    - Encapsulation of logic

    Dislikes:

    - No way to control drop behaviour

    My version lets you inject additional functionality at runtime. The adjusted class diagram shows the relationships, but we only really use the DragDropBehaviour class

    ![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_8-3-5.png) 
    { .post-img }

    You can still use the standard options:

    ```
    <DockPanel>
        <Label DockPanel.Dock="Top"  Content="Checkout" />
        <ListBox     hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDragSource="true"
                     hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDropTarget="true"
                     hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DragTemplate="{StaticResource MyTemplate}"
                     ItemsSource="{Binding Items}"
                     MinWidth="100"
                     MinHeight="100"
                     AllowDrop="True"
                     SelectionMode="Multiple">
        </ListBox>
    </DockPanel>
    ```

    But I have added another bindable option of DropProcessor that allows you to override the default DropProcessor to achieve whatever you want.

    ```
    <ListBox hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DropProcessor="{Binding DropProcessor}"
        hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDragSource="true"
        hlb:DragDropBehaviour.IsDropTarget="true"
        hlb:DragDropBehaviour.DragTemplate="{StaticResource moo}"
        ItemsSource="{Binding Items}"
        MinWidth="100"
        MinHeight="100">
    ```

    In this example I have created a little gun shop called “Nutters R’ Us” where you can buy weapons and ordinance. You can see that there is an area for weapons, and area for ordinance and an area for your selected purchases.

    ![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_7-2-4.png)
    { .post-img }

    I have added a custom DropProcessor only to the Checkout area that only applies when you drop items of type “OrdinanceViewModel”

    ```
    Public Class CheckoutDropProcessor
        Inherits DropProcessor

        Public Overrides Function GetDropAdorner(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal adornerLayer As System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer) As DropAdorner
            If TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then
                If TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then
                    Return New OrdnanceToWeaponDropAdorner(behaviour, adornerLayer)
                End If
            End If
            Return MyBase.GetDropAdorner(behaviour, adornerLayer)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Function IsDropAllowed(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal draggedItem As Object) As Boolean
            If Not behaviour.SourceItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then
                If Not behaviour.TargetItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then
                    Return True
                End If
                Return False
            End If
            Return MyBase.IsDropAllowed(behaviour, draggedItem)
        End Function

        Public Overrides Sub Drop(ByVal behaviour As DragDropBehaviour, ByVal draggedItem As Object, ByVal dropEffect As System.Windows.DragDropEffects)
            If Not behaviour.TargetItemContainer Is Nothing AndAlso TypeOf behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext Is WeaponViewModel Then
                If TypeOf behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext Is OrdnanceViewModel Then
                    CType(behaviour.TargetItemContainer.DataContext, WeaponViewModel).AddOrdinance(CType(behaviour.SourceItemContainer.DataContext, OrdnanceViewModel))
                    Dim indexRemoved As Integer = -1
                    If ((dropEffect And DragDropEffects.Move) <> DragDropEffects.None) Then
                        indexRemoved = Utilities.RemoveItemFromItemsControl(behaviour.SourceItemsControl, draggedItem)
                    End If
                    If (((indexRemoved <> -1) AndAlso (behaviour.SourceItemsControl Is behaviour.TargetItemsControl)) AndAlso (indexRemoved < behaviour.InsertionIndex)) Then
                        behaviour.InsertionIndex -= 1
                    End If
                    Exit Sub
                End If
            End If
            MyBase.Drop(behaviour, draggedItem, dropEffect)

        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    ![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_11-1-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    This class inherits from the base class “DropProcessor” that provides the same functionality as the original article, but I have

    overridden couple of methods. The first, “GetDropAdorner” test to make sure that you are dropping a OrdinanceViewModel onto a WeaponViewModel and provides a different and custom DropAdorner that instead of providing the lovely insertion visual it just applied a “IsDropTarget” property to the ListBoxItem to allow a template to control the visual. The IsAllowedDrop also test for this case, as does the Drop method. In all cases they are just testing for a special case of Drop and call the base classes methods.

    The diagram for the demo app is a little large, but you can see how much I still suck at MVVM, and although I have learned a lot doing this demo, I am still tempted to share ViewModels… but that is a bad habit.

    ![image](images/WpfDragDropbehaviour_E187-image_-6-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    I have highlighted the two main classes, and we have already discussed the CheckoutDropProcessor. This allows you the flexibility to augment your drop scenarios without all of your developers having to get too deep in the guts on the behaviour, thus leaving them plenty of time for the real work of actually building something useful.

    I have put this [up on Codeplex](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504), and both the [source](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504#DownloadId=79055) and [binaries](http://hinshlabs.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31504#DownloadId=79056) are available.

    Have you been waiting for a long time for [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/)? Well I have.. I have been able to use Beta 1 and the RC for a good while now, and it surprised me that the Windows 7 Beta 1 was more stable, responsive and cleaner than Vista was after Service Pack 3.

    [![image](images/afdc55547e00_C28F-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-afdc55547e00_C28F-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Today (06/08/2009) [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) RTM will be available for Developers on MSDN and a lovely free copy for those that participated in the invitation only Beta program.

    ![](images/hazmat.jpg)What a joy this day is, we finally get an OS that is both up to date and that we can use… I was nearly ready to hang up my PC and buy a MAC. Well, when I say NEARLY I really mean as far away as possible with a hazmat suit on, but you get the idea. Those of you that use Vista and like it, at least over the aging XP will love [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/). It is what Windows Vista should have been but wasn’t.
    { .post-img }

    If you have not yet seen [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) then head on over to the [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) site, if you have then it will not be long until it is available. September will be the official “buy it in the shops” day, but many new PC’s already come with an automatic upgrade.

    I am always pulling out the Unity assemblies. Maybe it is just because I am lazy, but I really can’t be bothered rolling my own dependency injection and mapping framework!

    ![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image_13-1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    I am going to use Unity only as a mapping frame work for now, I want to be able to pass an Interface into a method, and get back the correct data access class.

    The plan is to meet the diagram on the left. Only the factory and the interfaces are accessible, but are all set to “friend” which will require an assembly tag to be added to both the Factory and the Interfaces assemblies to allow explicit access.

    ```
    <Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Services.Server")>
    ```

    This allows classes in the named assembly to access all classes and methods that have been prefaced with the “Friend” access level. Its a sneaky way of helping to maintain your layer integrity. So with this reference added only the Services.Server assembly, the one with the web service implementation, can access the factory and the interfaces, making them un-callable from any other assembly.

    note: if you use only the assembly’s friendly name and not the explicit signed name then someone could just create an assembly of the same name as above and they will be able to call as if they were Services.Server. This is not to prevent hacking, just those pesky developers (me) who may try to bypass the service tier…

    If, like me you are running tests you will also need to add an InternalsVisibleTo entry for your test assemblies or you will be plagued by “Assessors”..

    First is my IDataAccess class, this is really only exists so there is some validation on my generics.

    [![image](images/CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image34_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingaDataAccesslayerusingUnity_E289-image34.png)

    ```
    ' Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common
    Public Interface IDataAccess

    End Interface
    ```

    I also have a more specific Interface that allows for the loading of Artefacts. I have not yet implemented anything more than get and add, but you can see that it inherits (yes an interface and inherits in the same sentence) from the IDataAccess interface so we can pass it as a generic type that complies with IDataAccess.

    ```
    'Assembly: Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common
    Imports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.Common

    Public Interface IArtifactDataAccess(Of T As Artifact)
        Inherits IDataAccess

        Function GetArtifact(ByVal id As Guid) As T
        Function GetArtifact(ByVal Uri As Uri) As T
        Function GetArtifacts() As ArtifactCollection
        Function AddArtifact(ByVal artifact As T) As Boolean

    End Interface
    ```

    Wow… that was hard, IDataAccess may have a little more than nothing in the future, but for now that is it. Now, what I need is a class that I can inherit from that will provide the functionality I need for any factory. This is mainly coz factories bread factories.

    The UnityFactoryBase class provides a couple of features. It provides a Singleton pattern so that we make sure that there is only ever one instance per factory type T and we initialise a UnityContainer for each Instance of factory T. You can see that on the class definition the generic type T that will be passed in is of the same type as the class itself. This makes sure that the class that represents T inherits from UnityFactoryBase(Of T As {New, UnityFactoryBase(Of T)}). When configuring the Unity Container we get both the container name and the config file to load from the child class. This allows for both different config files per factory and the option to have a single config file and multiple unity configuration elements. Its up to you…

    We need to inherit from UnityFactoryBase(Of T As {New, UnityFactoryBase(Of T)})  to create our factory and provide a config file to configure the UnityContainer. The inherited class is pretty simple as we have done most of the heavy lifting in the base class.

    Imports Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common

            Return UnityContainer.Resolve(Of T)()
        End Function

    End Class
    ```

    The DataAccessFactory provides the data needed by the UnityFactoryBase(Of DataAccessFactory) as well as the method that I need to retrieve an IDataAccess class. I will show you how it is called, but first there is the little matter of config:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
      <configSections>
        <section name="unity" type="Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration.UnityConfigurationSection, Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration" />
      </configSections>
      <unity>
        <typeAliases>
          <!-- Lifetime manager types should be inserted if you need lifetime managers -->
          <typeAlias alias="singleton" type="Microsoft.Practices.Unity.ContainerControlledLifetimeManager, Microsoft.Practices.Unity" />
          <typeAlias alias="external" type="Microsoft.Practices.Unity.ExternallyControlledLifetimeManager, Microsoft.Practices.Unity" />
          <!-- User defined type aliases -->
          <!-- An interface for artifact data access implementation -->
          <typeAlias alias="IArtifactDataAccess`1" type="Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common.IArtifactDataAccess`1, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Common" />
        </typeAliases>
        <containers>
          <container name="DataAccess">
            <types>
              <!-- Lifetime managers specified using the type aliases -->
              <type type="IArtifactDataAccess`1" mapTo="Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml.ArtifactDataAccess`1, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml">
                <lifetime type="singleton" />
              </type>
            </types>
          </container>
        </containers>
      </unity>
    </configuration>
    ```

    I am not going to explain the config file as it is well (ish) documented, but it effectively mapped all generic calls to retrieve IArtifactDataAccess\`1 to the implementation in the XML assembly of ArtifactDataAccess\`1 and makes the resultant object a singleton.

    To call this lovely package after you have populated it with many many DataAccess goodies all you need to do is this:

    ```
    Dim dal As IArtifactDataAccess(Of DynamicPolicy) = DataAccessFactory.Instance.GetDataAccess(Of IArtifactDataAccess(Of DynamicPolicy))()
    ```

    Lovely and simple, and to add a new implementation all I need is an Interface like IArtifactDataAccess.. lets call it IHypotheticalDataBits, a concrete implementation… lets call it HypoDataFromTwitter and a mapping in the config file:

    ```
    <type type="IHypotheticalDataBits" mapTo="Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml.HypoDataFromTwitter, Hinshlabs.TfsDynamicPolicy.DataAccess.Xml">
      <lifetime type="singleton" />
    </type>
    ```

    And you can then call:

    ```
    Dim dal As IHypotheticalDataBits = DataAccessFactory.Instance.GetDataAccess(Of IHypotheticalDataBits)()
    ```

    Any easier and it would be writing for you :)

    [![ConfigurationRequired](images/Aperfictmatch_701B-ConfigurationRequired_thumb-2-2.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Aperfictmatch_701B-ConfigurationRequired_2.jpg) I have always been annoyed with the mechanics of the Team Foundation Server check-in policies. I understand the limitations, but having to have a specific policy installed on every developers computer before you can use it is slightly ridicules and practically unmanageable. Why is there not a way to have a single installation that allows you to select any policy you want and have it execute in the desired manor on every client, including web clients?
    { .post-img }

    I think it is. With the advent of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) it should be possible to have a single (well one for each version of Visual Studio) policy that allows you to pick a DLR policy and have it run. One better would be to have a site that encapsulated those policies and you could just pick the one you want from a list. This could then open up a bunch of other features, like saved policy sets or composite policies for specific methodologies, or many others. But keeping to the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principal all I need are two or three things, a Web Service based data store, a Policy and an editor.

    I am currently working on the Web Services and how to pass and store the data I will need, but it looks promising and my initial investigations certainly worked quite well even though I am hampered by my lack of IronPython or IronRuby experience.

    [![ar123456585516148](images/Aperfictmatch_701B-ar123456585516148_thumb-1-1.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Aperfictmatch_701B-ar123456585516148_2.jpg)Once I have the web services up to scratch (WCF by the way) I will try my hand at the Editor (WPF) and then move onto the Web interface (ASP.NET MVC) all in Visual Studio 2010.  A mammoth task, but one I think I can manage… famous last words…

    I am not sure if this is a good idea, but I was bored one day and decided to add a TFS Error Log provider for [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/). There are 2 ways you can do this. You can create a new WorkItem type and log an error report for each of the errors or you can create one work item for each error type/title. To do this you can create a title that is the combination of error message and application name and then search TFS for an existing work item. If it exists then add the error to it, if it does not then create a work item for that instance. You can use any work item type, and the errors are added as [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) xml log files.

    There are a number of things you need to override when you inherit from [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/).ErrorLog. The first is the Log method.

    ```
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Logs the error as an attachment to an existing work item, or adds a new work item if this error has not occurred.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <param name="error">The error to be logged</param>
    ''' <returns>The ID of the error</returns>
    ''' <remarks></remarks>
    Public Overrides Function Log(ByVal [error] As [Error]) As String
        Dim errorId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
        Dim timeStamp = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-ddHHmmssZ", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)
        Dim Filename = String.Format("error-{0}-{1}.elmah", timeStamp, errorId)
        Dim temp = System.IO.Path.Combine(".", Filename)
        ' Temp Log to disk
        Using writer = New XmlTextWriter(temp, Encoding.UTF8)
            writer.Formatting = Formatting.Indented
            writer.WriteStartElement("error")
            writer.WriteAttributeString("errorId", errorId)
            ErrorXml.Encode([error], writer)
            writer.WriteEndElement()
            writer.Flush()
        End Using

        Dim Title As String = String.Format("{0}-{1}", [error].ApplicationName, [error].Message)

        Dim wi As WorkItem = GetWorkItemForException(Title, [error])

        Dim a As New Attachment(temp, "Elmah error log")

        wi.Attachments.Add(a)
        If wi.IsValid Then
            wi.Save()
            Return String.Format("{0}|{1}", wi.Id, errorId.ToString)
        Else
            Dim message As New System.Text.StringBuilder
            Dim results = wi.Validate()
            Dim isFirst As Boolean = True
            For Each r In results
                message.AppendLine(String.Format(IIf(isFirst, "{0}", ", {0}"), r))
                isFirst = False
            Next
            Throw New ApplicationException(String.Format("Unable to save the work item because the following fields produced a validation error '{0}'.", message.ToString))
        End If
    End Function
    ```

    The idea is that you attach the [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) log file to the work item with a .[elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) extension. This will allow us to find all the error logs in the future. So we create the temporary log file, and then create our key/title for our work item. You can customize this by customizing your exception messages on the server side. We then get our work item, and add the file as an attachment.

    Because I am doing this the quick and dirty way, i.e. just for fun, I have utilised the API’s provided in the Templates add-on for the Power Tools to customize the work items. So when we are creating the Work item:

    ```
    Protected Function GetWorkItemForException(ByVal Title As String, ByVal [error] As [Error]) As WorkItem
        Dim wi As WorkItem = GetExistingWorkItem(Title)
        If wi Is Nothing Then
            wi = CreateNewWorkItem(Title)
        End If
        m_TemplateDefault.Fields.ApplyFieldValues(wi, False)
        ApplyErrorFieldValues(wi, [error])
        Return wi
    End Function
    ```

    So, we either get an existing work item, or we create a new one, but then we need to apply some values to the work item. In the constructor of the class [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) passes an IDictionary object that we use to pass the template names.

    ```
    Public Sub New(ByVal config As IDictionary)
        If config Is Nothing Then
            Throw New ArgumentNullException("config")
        End If
        sm_Config = config

        Dim store As ITemplateStore = GetStore()
        m_TemplateDefault = GetTemplate("Defaults", store)
        m_TemplateErrorMap = GetTemplate("ErrorMap", store)

        If m_TemplateDefault Is Nothing Or m_TemplateErrorMap Is Nothing Then
            Throw New ApplicationException("Unable to load the templates from the store.")
        End If

    End Sub
    ```

    I created a Store (Microsoft.TeamFoundation.PowerTools.Client.WorkItemTracking.Templates.ITemplateStore) for the templates and attempt to load both a “defaults” template and a dynamic “mapping” template. The latter will need some special mapping, but as you can see from the GetWorkItemForException there is already a method on the Template object to Apply all of the values to a work item. Here is an example default template:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <Template xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <FieldValues>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>System.AreaPath</ReferenceName>
          <Value>TestProject1TestArea1</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>System.IterationPath</ReferenceName>
          <Value>TestProject1TestIteration1</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>System.AssignedTo</ReferenceName>
          <Value>Martin Hinshelwood</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>Microsoft.VSTS.CMMI.FoundInEnvironment</ReferenceName>
          <Value>DEV</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn</ReferenceName>
          <Value>Build_v1.13_20090312.1</Value>
        </FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <WorkItemTypeName>Bug</WorkItemTypeName>
      <TeamServerUri>http://tfs01.company.biz:8080/</TeamServerUri>
      <TeamProjectName>TestProject1</TeamProjectName>
      <Description />
    </Template>
    ```

    These values are now mapped onto the work item. But what about any dynamic values that we want to use from the Error. I added a second template called “ErrorMap” that will use the same format, but use something like:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <Template xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <FieldValues>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>System.AreaPath</ReferenceName>
          <Value>TestProject1{ApplicationName}</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>System.Description</ReferenceName>
          <Value>{WebHostHtmlMessage}</Value>
        </FieldValue>
        <FieldValue>
          <ReferenceName>Company.Custom.MethodName</ReferenceName>
          <Value>{Exception.TargetSite.Name}</Value>
        </FieldValue>
      </FieldValues>
      <WorkItemTypeName>Bug</WorkItemTypeName>
      <TeamServerUri>http://tfs01.company.biz:8080/</TeamServerUri>
      <TeamProjectName>TestProject1</TeamProjectName>
      <Description />
    </Template>
    ```

    We can then apply those values with a little reflection by parsing out the value and applying the retrieved object values to the work item.

    ```
    Private Sub ApplyErrorFieldValues(ByVal wi As WorkItem, ByVal [error] As [Error])
        For Each i In m_TemplateErrorMap.Fields
            Dim value As String = GetPropertyValue(i.Value, [error])
            If wi.Fields(i.ReferenceName).AllowedValues.Contains(value) Then

        Else
            Return r.GetValue(target, Nothing).ToString
        End If
    End Function
    ```

    Like I said this is work in progress and it does not support arrays as sub values, but it does add a certain level of versatility to the logging. My last project used a logging system, not [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/), to log errors to TFS in this way and I also added functionality to update the work item in different ways if it was Closed or Resolved to reactivate it depending on the Build number values.

    We have now created a new work item, but what about loading an existing one?

    ```
    Private Function GetExistingWorkItem(ByVal Title As String) As WorkItem
        ' Query for work items
        Dim query As String = "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] " _
                             & "FROM WorkItems " _
                             & "WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @Project  " _
                             & "AND  [System.WorkItemType] = @WorkItemType  " _
                             & "AND  [System.Title] = @Title  " _
                             & "ORDER BY [System.Id]"
        Dim paramiters As New Hashtable
        paramiters.Add("Project", m_TemplateDefault.TeamProjectName)
        paramiters.Add("WorkItemType", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)
        paramiters.Add("Title", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)
        Dim y As WorkItemCollection = TfsWorkItemStore.Query(query, paramiters)
        Return y(0)
    End Function
    ```

    This is a simple search for the title that we created and pass back the first match, just in case we have duplicates.

    And that's all there is to saving your logs into VSTS, but how do we get them out! This is pretty easy as all of our log entries have now been saved to a TFS work item and if you remember from before we used the “String.Format("{0}|{1}", wi.Id, errorId.ToString)“ for the ID so we can find the work item again.

    The two thing we have left is loading a single error, and loading all of the errors. Getting a single error is a little tricky, which is why we passed back the ID in a format that included the Work Item ID.

    ```
    Public Overrides Function GetError(ByVal id As String) As ErrorLogEntry
        Dim idBits() As String = id.Split("|")
        Dim wiId As Integer
        Dim errGuid As String
        If Not idBits.Length = 2 Then
            Throw New ArgumentException("Invalid ID, it must be made in the format {workItemId}|{guid}", "id")
        End If
        If Not IsNumeric(idBits(0)) Then
            Throw New ArgumentException("The workItemId part of the ID must be an integer. Format: {workItemId}|{guid}", "id")
        End If
        wiId = CInt(idBits(0))
        Try
            errGuid = New Guid(idBits(1)).ToString
        Catch ex As Exception
            Throw New ArgumentException("The guid part of the ID must be an integer. Format: {workItemId}|{guid}", "id")
        End Try
        Dim wi As WorkItem = TfsWorkItemStore.GetWorkItem(wiId)
        If wi Is Nothing Then
            Throw New ApplicationException("A work item with that id does not exits")
        End If
        Dim a = (From attachemnt As Attachment In wi.Attachments Where attachemnt.Name.Contains(errGuid) Select attachemnt).SingleOrDefault
        If a Is Nothing Then
            Throw New ApplicationException("The attachment does not exits or has been removed")
        End If
        Return GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(wi, a)
    End Function
    ```

    In this method we do a little validation while parsing out the Work Item ID and the [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) ID, we then load the specified work item, and find the attachment, and return it. I have a little helper method to make a log item from an attachment, but it fairly simple:

    ```
    Private Function GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(ByVal wi As WorkItem, ByVal a As Attachment) As ErrorLogEntry
        Using reader = XmlReader.Create(a.Uri.ToString)
            If Not reader.IsStartElement("error") Then
                Return Nothing
            End If
            Dim errid = String.Format("{0}|{1}", wi.Id, reader.GetAttribute("errorId"))
            Dim [error] = ErrorXml.Decode(reader)
            Return New ErrorLogEntry(Me, errid, [error])
        End Using
        Return Nothing
    End Function
    ```

    And voila! You havve a single Error Log Entry. As you have probably guesses, getting all the errors is easy now. We just need to find all attachements that have a .[elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) extension in our project. A little linq can help with this.

    ```
    Public Overrides Function GetErrors(ByVal pageIndex As Integer, ByVal pageSize As Integer, ByVal errorEntryList As System.Collections.IList) As Integer
        If pageIndex < 0 Then Throw New ArgumentOutOfRangeException("pageIndex", pageIndex, Nothing)
        If pageSize < 0 Then Throw New ArgumentOutOfRangeException("pageSize", pageSize, Nothing)

        ' Query for work items
        Dim query As String = "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] " _
                             & "FROM WorkItems " _
                             & "WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @Project  " _
                             & "AND  [System.WorkItemType] = @WorkItemType  " _
                             & "ORDER BY [System.Id]"
        Dim paramiters As New Hashtable
        paramiters.Add("Project", m_TemplateDefault.TeamProjectName)
        paramiters.Add("WorkItemType", m_TemplateDefault.WorkItemTypeName)
        Dim y As WorkItemCollection = TfsWorkItemStore.Query(query, paramiters)
        ' Query work items for attachments
        Dim wiats = From wi As WorkItem In y, a As Attachment In wi.Attachments Where a.Name.Contains(".elmah") Order By a.Name Select a, wi
        If Not wiats Is Nothing Then
            ' Select specific attachemnts
            Dim results = From wiat In wiats Skip pageIndex * pageSize Take pageSize Select wiat
            ' Add to output
            For Each el In results
                errorEntryList.Add(GetErrorLogEntryFromTfsAttachement(el.wi, el.a))
            Next
        End If
        ' return count
        Return errorEntryList.Count
    End Function
    ```

    And there we go, errors from [Elmah](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) saved into Team Foundation Server and then loaded back out. I don’t know how useful this would be in the real world, but it was good for a little boredom relief.

    Even though this sounds like a really simple thing, what if you do not know the name of the controls, and you do not want to have to add a bit of code that you, or another may developer may forget to every piece of code with a timer in it. The problem I have is that if you have a DropDownList on the same page as a update panel that updates based on a timer, you get a little interference.

    If the user has the DropDownList open when the update occurs then the DropDownList closes. Very annoying.

    The standard FindControl does not work as it requires an ID, so what if all you have is a type?

    Well, you need a little extension method :)

    ```
    Imports System.Runtime.CompilerServices
    Imports System.Web
    Imports System.Web.UI

    Module WebExtensions

        <Extension()> _
        Friend Sub FindControls(Of T)(ByVal control As Control, ByVal list As List(Of T))
            If control.HasControls Then
                Dim timers = control.Controls.OfType(Of T)()
                list.AddRange(timers)
                Dim subcontrols = From c In control.Controls Where Not timers.Cast(Of Control).Contains(c)
                For Each c In subcontrols.Cast(Of Control)()
                    c.FindControls(Of T)(list)
                Next
            End If
        End Sub

        <Extension()> _
        Friend Function FindControls(Of T)(ByVal control As Control) As List(Of T)
            Dim l As New List(Of T)
            control.FindControls(Of T)(l)
            Return l
        End Function

    End Module
    ```

    I am pretty sure this is not the most efficient of code, and any recommendation on improving it are welcome…

    Once this is in place it is easily called and actioned upon:

    ```
    Sub OnPagePreRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)

        ' Fix for pages with drop down lists
        FixForDropdownListsAndTimers()
    End Sub

    Private Sub FixForDropdownListsAndTimers()
        ' Provcess timers
        Me.FindControls(Of System.Web.UI.Timer).ForEach(New Action(Of System.Web.UI.Timer)(AddressOf ProcessTimers))
    End Sub

    Private Sub ProcessTimers(ByVal t As System.Web.UI.Timer)
        t.Enabled = Not DisableTimers
    End Sub
    ```

    DisableTimers is set at the page level and filters down to the control so we can now disable all timers on a page when we want.

    The FindControls method can find a list of all instances of a control type from an entire page, regardless of the nesting…

    UPDATE: OK, so you have probably guessed that I am a complete **_muppet_**.. I have changes my UpdatePanels to UpdateMode=“Conditional” and with a few extra lines of code solved my problem the correct way! I will be keeping this little bit of code as you never know when you need to find all instances of a type of control :)… I am such a donkey…

    I was asked by a colleague to provide a list of all files that were changed under a particular iteration. Rather than delving into the data, I made a couple of API calls to TFS to output a text file with the list.

    This is probably not the most efficient method and it is hard coded, but it does output the goods:

    ```
    Dim tfs As New TeamFoundationServer("http://testtfs01:8080")
    Dim store As WorkItemStore = tfs.GetService(GetType(WorkItemStore))
    Dim version As VersionControlServer = tfs.GetService(GetType(VersionControlServer))
    ' Query for work items
    Dim query As String = "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] " _
                         & "FROM WorkItems " _
                         & "WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @Project  " _
                         & "AND  [System.IterationPath] UNDER @IterationPath  " _
                         & "ORDER BY [System.Id]"
    Dim paramiters As New Hashtable
    paramiters.Add("Project", "TestProject1")
    paramiters.Add("IterationPath", "TestProject1TestIteration1")
    Dim y As WorkItemCollection = store.Query(query, paramiters)
    Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Found {0} work items", y.Count))
    ' Query work items for attachments
    Dim wiats = From wi As WorkItem In y, l As Link In wi.Links Where l.BaseType = BaseLinkType.ExternalLink Select l, wi
    Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Loading {0} changesets...", wiats.Count))
    Dim ChangeSets As New List(Of Changeset)
    If Not wiats Is Nothing Then
        Dim els = From i In wiats Where LinkingUtilities.DecodeUri(CType(i.l, ExternalLink).LinkedArtifactUri).ArtifactType = "Changeset"
        For Each i In wiats
            Dim el As ExternalLink = CType(i.l, ExternalLink)
            Dim artifact As ArtifactId = LinkingUtilities.DecodeUri(el.LinkedArtifactUri)
            If artifact.ArtifactType = "Changeset" Then
                Dim cs As Changeset = version.ArtifactProvider.GetChangeset(New Uri(el.LinkedArtifactUri))
                ChangeSets.Add(cs)
            End If
        Next
        ' ------------------------------
        Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} changesets loaded", ChangeSets.Count))
        Dim files = From f In ChangeSets, c In f.Changes Select c.Item Distinct
        Using x = System.IO.File.CreateText("c:Tempfiles.txt")
            For Each f In files
                x.WriteLine(f.ServerItem)
            Next

        End Using

    End If
    If Debugger.IsAttached Then
        Console.ReadKey()
    End If
    ```

    As you can see I have very bad naming and layout, but this is a one time use version of the code, so quick and dirty. If I am asked to do this again I would create a proper command line utility, or even a WPF interface to display the data prettily.

    I am having a little problem with Visual Studio 2008 that only started after I had installed Office 2010. I found this interesting post on [Visual Studio 2008 Locks or Freezes in ASPX](http://abdullin.com/journal/2009/5/12/visual-studio-2008-locks-or-freezes-in-aspx.html) from [Rinat Abdullin](http://abdullin.com/) that was a complete match to the problem I am having.

    Basically VS just bings at you whenever you click anywhere as if there is a model dialog open after opening and trying to edit an aspx file.

    If you get this problem then there is a simple solution, well, one that worked for me. You need to run a repair on the “Microsoft Visual Studio Web Authoring Component” that is part of Office 2007.

    [![image](images/Office2010gotcha2_876A-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Office2010gotcha2_876A-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }
    { .post-img }

    You can find the setup in the following locations:

    > **Windows 64bit**
    >
    > C:Program Files (x86)Common Filesmicrosoft sharedOFFICE12Office Setup ControllerSetup.exe
    >
    > **Windows 32bit**
    >
    > C:Program FilesCommon Filesmicrosoft sharedOFFICE12Office Setup ControllerSetup.exe

    My guess is that when Office 2010 is installed it has a new version of this component that has not yet been made compatible with Visual Studio 2008…

    It was a frustrating couple of hours this morning to figure it out with the bulk of the time taken up with an ineffectual repair of Visual Studio 2008 SP1, ahh well, now I know…

    Now I have [uninstalled Office 2007 32bit](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/07/16/installing-office-2010-gotcha-1.aspx) I am ready to get this 2010 thing going…

    I am installing on Vista 64, I know, but I cant get Windows 7 in the office yet…

    [![image](images/Office2010Install_D5D5-image_thumb-6-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Office2010Install_D5D5-image_2.png)

    I always do a full install, coz I really hate not having that feature that you need that you did not know that you need ;)

    [![image](images/Office2010Install_D5D5-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Office2010Install_D5D5-image_4.png)

    { .post-img }

    Now, although I am not using very much of the resources on my computer, the install seems to be making it relatively unresponsive.

    [![image](images/Office2010Install_D5D5-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Office2010Install_D5D5-image_8.png) 
    { .post-img }

    Not a big deal, but Visual Studio can be unresponsive anyway…so…where did all my productivity go :(

    I will need to be quick, I have a dentists appointment (arg!), but I could not leave without at least a peek at Office 2010, so Outlook being my weapon of necessity, that the choice:

    { .post-img }

    You can’s see it from a still, but those colours are dancing about, and I just caught a glimpse of the magic words “Importing user settings”… I am a happy man…

    So, its smile time…

    { .post-img }

    I think this form of feedback is both informal and excellent for encouraging user participation…

    Usual activation…

    Woo, when you select an email you get a nice little tasks list, just what I wanted.

    { .post-img }

    Nice… It does a little conversation stuff and from what I can see its a LOT better than Google… When will this functionality hit Live Mail I wonder…

    Well, its dentist time, so that's all I have time for… Will try to install on Windows 7 tonight…

    I am installing office 2010, and I ran into my first gotcha!

    I have a 64 bit computer and I wanted to use the 64bit version of Office, but there is no upgrade option for this, you need to uninstall Office 2007 32bit (the only version there is) and put the 64bit on… Here is the message…

    [![image](images/InstallingOffice2010_CF66-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingOffice2010_CF66-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    This sucks a little, and will suck even more if I can’t keep my settings. Mainly for Outlook, and why I need to uninstall Expression Studio Web I do not know, it may be due to some integration for creating html emails…

    This will be a 64 bit adoption blocker for companies as this will be difficult to automate…

    I think with the prevalence of 64bit hardware, the release of Windows 7, and the RAM now coming as standard in new computers getting above 3.5GB there will be a lot more 64 bit upgrades and this needs to be looked at… I don’t know if it is possible, but can’t the install just uninstall my previous versions? Maybe this is just a Technology Preview limitation…

    Hey, well the dentist was fun! And I have had time to install Office 2010 on my wife's Windows 7 laptop. I will try to put together some of the interesting features…

    This is nice. Much better than the Google Mail one and is starting to make more sense the more I use it. I am connecting to my Google Mail via IMAP and this example illustrates the feature nicely.

    [![image](images/FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Here is a conversation that has three emails. Aaron sent the first message and both Brian and Neno replied. It shows Brian and Aaron’s email  on the same line because Brian’s email is the most recent in the conversation. But Neno also replied and thus it is a split conversation. Think of it like a wee tree with Aaron’s email having 2 branches with Brian’s email being the latest. If you leave it rolled up you never see Aaron’s email, just the latest with the trail in it. This both minimizes the number of emails you have to read, and groups them together so you can follow the conversation.

    [![image](images/FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FindingfeaturesConversations_1343F-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you open it out, it shows all three emails, with the replies with the little dots.

    Here is an example when all of the replies come in order.

    I have been using an excellent piece of software for twittering form my Windows Mobile. [Twikini](http://www.trinketsoftware.com/Twikini) has all of the features you would expect, as well as working fantastically with the IPhone like features of Windows Mobile 6.5.

    ![Screenshot](images/Twikini04.gif)
    { .post-img }

    I had used a few of the other apps that are available, but I think this is the best for the way that I use Twitter. The only thing that I have had a problem with is that on my phone keyboard between the “r” and the “t” is the hotkey for “Tweet”, and I quite often send in an unfinished tweet. Really a phone issue, but could do with an optional “confirm tweet” checkbox.

    Ahh well, can’t have everything…

    I have just finished installing [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") 2010 beta 1 and doing an upgrade of out TFS 2008 data. This did not go well…

    Due to a collation mismatch between my original SQL Server 2005 and my new SQL Server 2008 I received an error when upgrading…

    > \[Error  @13:57:23.665\] TF255184: An error occurred during operation.  Message=Cannot resolve the collation conflict between "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" and "Latin1_General_CI_AS" in the equal to operation.

    > \[Error  @13:57:23.681\] TF254026: An error occurred during the following operation: Upgrade. The error occurred during the following step group: Upgrade.TfsTeamBuild. It occurred on the following step: Check In Build Process Templates. The following message was returned: Cannot resolve the collation conflict between "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" and "Latin1_General_CI_AS" in the equal to operation.

    And then the roll back of the transaction did not quite work as expected, so although the TFS Administration does not know about my OldTfs2008Test1 project collection.

    Solution? Suck it up and reinstall everything, including SQL and change the collation to the same on both servers. :(

    If, like me, you are stuck with the old and decrepit version of Windows that is Vista SP1 at work then you may be interested in Service Pack 2 which became available on the MS Download site today.

    [Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2 - Five Language Standalone (KB948465)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&DisplayLang=en)

    I am not saying that I would rather have XP, but even with my work development computer ( 8 cores, 4gb rams, 2x 10000rpm raptors, raid 0+1) I find that it is sometimes a struggle finding some resources with which to run Visual Studio…

    For me this is not a lot, and I have more running on my wife's laptop (2 cores, 4gb ram, 5400rpm HDD) with less problems on Windows 7 RC. I am not saying that Windows 7 uses less resources, but it certainly makes better use of them…

    Well, lets hope SP2 solves at least some of these problems…

    I think as usual with Vista only Part 1 of 3 will be done while I can still work… with part 2 on shutdown and 3 on reboot…

    You can find out loads about what is in it from:

    Easy peasy, all you need is the full URL from the project collection and you will be able to connect directly to it as if it was a different Team Server. This functionality was added with Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1, so if you don’t have SP1 installed yet you had better get it:

    [Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FBEE1648-7106-44A7-9649-6D9F6D58056E&displaylang=en "Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1")

    You need to use the following in the connection box “http://\[tfsserver\]:\[port\]/\[vdir\]/\[projectCollection\]

    Although this looks complicated, it makes some sense at least, but is nowhere as nice as using the 2010 connection box:

    [![image](images/ConnectingVS2008toanyTFS2010ProjectColle_D5E5-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ConnectingVS2008toanyTFS2010ProjectColle_D5E5-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    One of the new things in [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") 2010 is that you can specify a virtual directory that it will run under, the default being “tfs” so you can have everything on the same ports.

    So, if your tfs server name is “tfs01.domainname.com” and you take the default vdir of “tfs”, all you need is the collection name. So you could end up with “http://tfs01.domainname.com:80/tfs/MyNewCollection”

    Backward compatibility +1

    Connecting from Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 is a different story, there is currently no way to connect VS2005 to TFS2010. There has been some discussion around this and its importance to Business Intelligence teams. If you are just opening VS2005/VS2003 occasionally then you could probably get away with using 2010 to control TFS and working in 2005, but many BI developers are still spending a considerable amount of there time in 2005 :(

    Microsoft recently opened up there beta of the MyPhone service to the general public. The service syncs your Mobile phone with the web and allows access to your Contacts Calendar tasks, pictures and more.

    [![image](images/MicrosoftMyPhoneserviceavailabletothepub_E1A9-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MicrosoftMyPhoneserviceavailabletothepub_E1A9-image_2.png)

    I have just left it running, but you can add stuff to your phone through this interface as well. I see the bonus of this as a backup, which I kinda have with Plaxo.com already for my contacts and calendar, but having your pictures and video up there too is much easier than connecting your phone into the computer.

    I do not know what the bandwidth is like, but the fact that you cant set the sync any more frequently than once a day is an indication that it must be intensive. Make sure that you have a good hold of your data tariff for this one (I have unlimited for £9 from Orange), but for a beta it is a pretty cool service. I would like to see it integrated with SkyDrive for storage and a roll up of all these bits into [http://home.live.com…we](http://home.live.com…we) can but hope.

    Setup you phone by going to [http://myphone.microsoft.com](http://myphone.microsoft.com "http://myphone.microsoft.com")

    This problem it seams is to do with the way Visual Studio 2010 connects to your [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server over HTTPS. The default value for “BypassProxyOnLocal” in Visual Studio 2008 was “False”, but it has been changed to “True” for Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1. It should be noted that this is currently a Beta 1 workaround and this behaviour may be updated for Beta 2 and RTM.

    You can fix this by adding the following registry keys and restarting Visual Studio 2010:

    You need to add a “RequestSettings” key to both of the following location that contains a string value pair of “BypassProxyOnLocal=’False’”.

    32bit OS Key Locations:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftTeamFoundationServer10.0RequestSettings

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftVisualStudio10.0TeamFoundationRequestSettings
    ```

    64bit key locations:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftTeamFoundationServer10.0RequestSettings

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftVisualStudio10.0TeamFoundationRequestSettings
    ```

    You can find out more on the “[How to: Change the BypassProxyOnLocal Configuration](<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb909716(loband).aspx>)” documentation on MSDN.

    The reason is simple, it has no MSDN documentation in it. I for one never install the MSDN documentation and just use the online version and have always found it a pain to have it inside the same installation, but may people find it useful.

    And, why is there no Offline MSDN documentation? The answer is simple, it is not ready yet…

    You may think, why is he uninstalling VS2010? Well, apart from proving that it works…And that it plays well with VS2008 I need to remove the pre-beta beta that I have installed.

    [![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    This is in fact the second time I have uninstalled VS2010 on this computer, and I had no problems last time, but the difference is that I will be installing a slightly different build :) of Beta 1.

    I am hoping that I do not have any problems, but my scenario is largely unsupported.

    I have removed visual studio, but it probably left a few trainer that I will need to remove manually. The easiest way is to see what was installed in the last month and check it all… Gruelling I know, but what can you do…

    There is a nice little feature in Vista when you are in the programs list that lets you filter the list… coz it can be realy big

    [![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_1-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Here is he list of software I have installed in the last month:

    [![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_2-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    I have highlighted all of the 2010 bits and it at first seams like there are rather a lot of them, but as you go through the list (I will finish with the .NET 4.0 bits) you find that it is just a cleanup issue..

    [![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_3-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    So I then had some fun uninstalling .NET 4.0…

    I know that this was unsupported, and that we were warned us not to do it, but we are developers and we like to push the big red buttons, but I installed the pre-beta beta on my production computer…

    During the uninstall there was an infinite number of runtime errors.

    [![clip_image002](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image002_thumb-2-2.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image002_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    And after cancelling and rebooting received lots of .net 4.0 errors for all sorts of applications upon boot.

    [![clip_image004](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image004_thumb-3-3.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-clip_image004_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    The same thing happened during my second attempt at uninstalling. The plan now is to try a repair and then an uninstall...

    Well, the repair failed, so I am going strait to installing from the new .NET 4.0 Beta 1 release and everything seams to be working ok so far. I realise that my computer will be in an unknown state afterwards, but I can always reinstall when I get the chance.

    [![image](images/UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_thumb_4-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-UninstallingVisualStudio2010Beta1_7977-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    And after a restart, no problems… Wohooo….

    Now to VS2010… And if my infrastructure team get me my VPC there will be [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") fun as Well.

    So the end result is that although I have not uninstalled .NET 4.0, I do have the latest version which is what I wanted…

    I have a number of [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") projects that I connect to from work and I have had a problem since 2008 that it does not always send my authentication to the proxy server (ISA). What this manifests as is that I get a popup telling me that “Proxy authentication is required”. The workaround was to connect in offline and then click the connect button and everything invariable works with no additional problems.

    With Visual Studio 2010 the mater is slightly different. It pops up with a vague error that I had not seen before, but a little searching seamed to indicate that it may be the proxy problem rearing its ugly head in a killer way.

    [![SavingToCodeplexOverHttpsThroughISA](images/image-1.png)](images/image-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    So the “ServicePointManager does not support proxies with the https scheme” error has been seen before when connecting to [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") services through a proxies. The fix is code based, so that is not something that I can achieve, so I have raised a [bug](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=453677) on Connect.

    If you are experiencing this problem, then please add your support to the work item:

    ![VS-TS_rgb_thumb[2][5][5][5][5]](images/VisualStudio2010SupportsUML_EC8C-VS-TS_rgb_thumb25555_-3-3.png)Just in case you have been living in a shed at the bottom of the garden, Visual Studio 2010 is to support UML. As you can see from my diagram, my UML skills are a little, erm, crude. But I think you will get the picture and if you want to do better then just download [Visual Studio 2010 on Wednesday](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-gb/products/2010/default.mspx) if you are not an MSDN subscribe, and if you are… well you can get it today :)

    { .post-img }

    As I have not used UML since university so I do not know if this feature will meet the needs of those that use UML extensively, but I would expect that a lot of time and investment has gone into this area, and if it is lacking in some minor but crucial feature, there is still time to get some changes made…maybe...

    ![VS-TS_rgb_thumb[2][5][5][5]](images/MultiTargetinginVisualStudio2010_EBFB-VSTS_rgb_thumb2555-4-4.png)We thought that we had it good in Visual Studio 2008, being able to target .NET 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5, but in reality they were all running on the .NET 2.0 Runtime, just with a different set of available libraries. Well Visual Studio 2010 take it that little bit further by being able to target .NET 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0.

    ![image_thumb1](images/MultiTargetinginVisualStudio2010_EBFB-image_thumb1_-3-3.png)
    { .post-img }

    This will be an invaluable feature as, if it turns out to be stable enough, you will be able to build or work on your existing 2.0 Runtime application and websites in Visual Studio 2010. One feature that I was disappointed to see missing is the ability to open project files in both Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 simultaneously, that way you could move some of your developers over to 2010 and have the rest on 2008 on the same project…

    But I guess we can’t have everything, and some features will be dropped for the sake of actually getting a product finished…

    ![ar123456585516148](images/MultiTargetinginVisualStudio2010_EBFB-ar123456585516148_3-2-2.jpg)Well done to the Product teams for this mammoth feet…

    ![VS-TS_rgb_thumb[2]](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-VSTS_rgb_thumb2-8-8.png)It’s here, [Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-gb/products/2010/default.mspx). This is probably the most exciting product to come out of Microsoft since…well… Visual Studio 2008 ;).
    { .post-img }

    ![image_thumb9](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-image_thumb9-7-7.png)
    { .post-img }

    The install will be totally familiar to those of you that have installed Visual Studio before, but you will note that there are no options like we had before where we could choose which components we want installed.

    ![image_thumb6](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-image_thumb6-6-6.png)
    { .post-img }

    What we do get is the option to install for Managed or Native or both, this makes it easier for the those of us who just want all of the bits for the “thing” that we do.

    ![image_thumb10](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-image_thumb10-1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can, however click “Customize” at the bottom of the page to see the usual bits that, lets be honest, hardly any of us will use :)

    ![image_thumb12](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-image_thumb12-2-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    I will be doing a full install by ticking both “Managed” and “Native” to get the works…Once you kick off the install you get a much nicer progress tracker.

    ![image_thumb14](images/InstallingVisualStudio2010TeamSuitBeta1_EA00-image_thumb14-3-3.png) 
    { .post-img }

    The install took around 30 minutes, also a big improvement over previous versions, And you are done.

I will document the install process here, because well, some people just need assurances that it works ;)
    { .post-img }

    Microsoft are adding some excellent features like the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) and huge improvements to Domain Specific Languages. There will also be Visual Basic 10 and C# 4 that add a lot of features and bring the two languages closer together in everything except syntax. You can find out more about the exciting features that are adding and the updates to existing features by searching the web, but Lets get to the install…

    Just like the previous versions of the .NET Framework, there are really no options on the install… Just accept the licence agreement and install.

    [![image_thumb2](images/Installing.NET4_.0Beta1onWindowsVista64x_E872-image_thumb2-1-1.png)](/Users/martihins/AppData/Local/Temp/WindowsLiveWriter1286139640/supfiles16EE3EF/image6.png)
    { .post-img }

    The install took less than 20 minutes on my computer, which is a big improvement on 3.5! We will need to see how it performs on a virtual environment which I regularly have to leave overnight for a 3.5 install.

    [![image_thumb3](images/Installing.NET4_.0Beta1onWindowsVista64x_E872-image_thumb3-2-2.png)](/Users/martihins/AppData/Local/Temp/WindowsLiveWriter1286139640/supfiles16EE3EF/image7.png)
    { .post-img }

    You can find out what is new in the framework  from these blogs:

    As you can see, when connecting to a TFS 2008 server you can see a single Team Projects collection called “Legacy server”, and a list of your projects. For more information about Project Collections try [Brian Harry’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/04/19/team-foundation-server-2010-key-concepts.aspx).

    I have been attempting to integrate the Unity Application Block into my website to allow me to share the same base object code between a WPF and an ASP.NET application. I will let you know how I am getting along later as I am still knee deep in refactoring, but I have found something a little useful.

    I have created a custom “My” object in Visual Studio. This means that I can do “My.Unity.Container” to retrieve my UnityContainer object form anywhere is my code. I know it my be trivial to achieve in other ways, but I am a VB degenerate having fun, so leave me alone…

    The first thing we need is a way of consistently creating a singleton instance of our UnityContainer across all of our code in the AppDomain.

    ```
    Imports Microsoft.Practices.Unity

    Public Class UnityContainer
        Inherits Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer

        Private Shared sm_UnityContainer As Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer
        Private Shared sm_syncRoot As New Object

        Private Sub New()
            MyBase.New()
        End Sub

        Public Shared ReadOnly Property Current() As Microsoft.Practices.Unity.UnityContainer
            Get
                If (sm_UnityContainer Is Nothing) Then
                    SyncLock sm_syncRoot
                        If (sm_UnityContainer Is Nothing) Then
                            sm_UnityContainer = New UnityContainer
                            'Dim section As UnityConfigurationSection = ConfigurationManager.GetSection("unity")
                            'section.Containers.Default.Configure(sm_UnityContainer)
                        End If
                    End SyncLock
                End If
                Return sm_UnityContainer
            End Get
        End Property

    End Class
    ```

    I have commented the lines out, but you could also initialise the Unity Container from a config file, but remember that it will be the top level config of your application root an not the config from the Assembly that you code happens to be in.

    We could just leave it at that, and If you use C# this is about your lot, but in VB you have the “My” namespace that gives you access to some useful things all in one place.

    [![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_2-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    In order to achieve this you need to create a Module in the “My” namespace that has a single property that access the previous class.

    ```
    Imports Common

    Namespace My

      <HideModuleName()> _
      Module MyUnityExtensions

            Friend ReadOnly Property Unity() As UnityContainer
                Get
                    Return UnityContainer.Current
                End Get
            End Property

        End Module

    End Namespace
    ```

    This the allows you to access the UnityContainer object in the same way that you would access My.User.

    [![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_3-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    Inside the Unity object you will have all of the shared properties and methods that we created earlier.

    [![image](images/NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_thumb_5-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NinjaUnity_B1DE-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    To examine the use of this I have followed [O1eg Smirnov](http://www.codeproject.com/Members/O1eg-Smirnov)’s [Ninja Dependency Injection](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/UnityApplicationBlockNDI.aspx) scenario.

    So, I have a Console application that registers a sword type and the resolves out a Ninja Object using Unity.

    ```
    Imports NinjaCommon

    Module Module1

        Sub Main()

            ' Register Weapon
            My.Unity.RegisterType(Of IWeapon, Sword)()
            'Create Ninja
            Dim ninja = My.Unity.Resolve(Of Ninja)()
            ' Ninja uses weapon
            ninja.Weapon.use()
            ' Create Battle
            Dim battle As New NinjaClasses.Battle
            ' Start the fight
            battle.StartFight()

            Console.ReadKey()
        End Sub

    End Module
    ```

    But it then instantiates a Battle class from the NinjaClasses assembly which uses it own My.Unity class to access the same UnityContainer object.

    ```
    Public Class Battle

        Public Sub New()

        End Sub

        Public Sub StartFight()
            Console.WriteLine("Fight Starting ")
            ' Create 10 ninjas and get them to use their weapon.
            For count = 1 To 10
                Dim ninja = My.Unity.Resolve(Of NinjaCommon.Ninja)()
                ninja.Weapon.use()
            Next
            Console.WriteLine("Fight ended")
        End Sub

    End Class
    ```

    Although this example in no way demonstrates the power of the Unity Application Block, and is a bit silly, I think it demonstartes the use of the “My” namespace.

    Using Dependency Injection in a website can get a little dodgy, but in my ASP.NET site use the same base code as my WPF app, I needed a little dependency injection to resolve references at runtime when the application type is known. Now in your ASP.NET page just like in your WPF application you need a little extra bit to get it all going. Finding this for WPF is easy, not so much in ASP.

    ```
    Imports System.Web
    Imports System.Web.UI
    Imports Microsoft.Practices.Unity
    ''' <summary>
    ''' C# version and source

    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks></remarks>
    Public Class UnityHttpModule
        Implements IHttpModule

        Public Sub Dispose() Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Dispose

        End Sub

        Public Sub Init(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpApplication) Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Init
            AddHandler context.PreRequestHandlerExecute, AddressOf OnPreRequestHandlerExecute
        End Sub

        Private Sub OnPreRequestHandlerExecute(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
            Dim handler As IHttpHandler = HttpContext.Current.Handler
            If TypeOf handler Is Page Then
                My.Unity.Container.BuildUp(handler.GetType(), handler)

                ' User Controls are ready to be built up after the page initialization is complete
                Dim page As Page = handler
                If Not page Is Nothing Then
                    AddHandler page.InitComplete, AddressOf OnPageInitComplete
                End If
            End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub OnPageInitComplete(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
            Dim page As Web.UI.Page = sender
            For Each c In BuildControlTree(page)
                Try
                    My.Unity.Container.BuildUp(c.GetType(), c)
                Catch ex As Exception
                    ' TODO: Some sort of error handling if important
                    WebPortalTrace.Verbose(WebPortalTraceType.Unity, "Unity unable to build up {0}", c.GetType)
                End Try
            Next
        End Sub

        ' Get the controls in the page's control tree excluding the page itself
        Private Function BuildControlTree(ByVal root As Control) As List(Of Control)
            Dim ct As New List(Of Control)
            For Each c In root.Controls
                ct.Add(c)
                ct.AddRange(BuildControlTree(c))
            Next
            Return ct
        End Function

    End Class
    ```

    All you need is to put a reference into your config file:

    ```
      <system.web>
        <httpModules>
          <add name="UnityHttpModule" type="Company.Product.UnityHttpModule, Company.Product"/>
        </httpModules>
      </system.web>
    ```

    And off you go, before you know it you will have dependency injection coming out of your ears.

    One of the advantages to using dependency injection is that you could change a piece of functionality without having to recompile and redeploy your site! How about this…

    ```
    <unity>
        <containers>
          <container>
            <types>
              <type type="Company.Product.ViewModels.IRecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product" mapTo="Company.Product.ViewModels.RecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product" />
            </types>
          </container>
        </containers>
    </unity>
    ```

    The business then decide that they have to have the order of the recent items list changed but that it needs to go into production immediately, so your testing cycle is extremely tight. No problem… fire up a new solution and create a new class that inherits from IRecentItemsViewModel and implement the new functionality. Then compile it as “Company.Product.Hotfix1”, drop it into your test site bin folder and change line above to:

    ```
    <unity>
        <containers>
          <container>
            <types>
              <type type="Company.Product.ViewModels.IRecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product" mapTo="Company.Product.Hotfix1.ViewModels.RecentItemsViewModel, Company.Product.Hotfix1" />
            </types>
          </container>
        </containers>
    </unity>
    ```

    The site will then load your new code and you can test the only functionality that you have changed, before deploying to production. Now this may not seam like much, but if your system is made up of thousands of views then you may just need this functionality. And it is so easy to achieve that even for small projects it is fantastic.

    P.S. Works with MVC… shhhh…

    For my wife’s birthday my brother and his wife bought us a professional photo shoot, and the photographer got some [fantastic shots](http://perfectexpressions.co.uk/blog/2009/05/the-hinshelwood-family-portrait-shoot/). I love the one of my daughter jumping. We have had a couple of go’s at this before, but we have always been disappointed in both the photographer and the results.

    John Johnston at [Perfect Expressions](http://www.perfectexpressions.co.uk) was fantastic, he was patient with the kids, and that takes a lot with my daughter, I think the [shots](http://perfectexpressions.co.uk/blog/2009/05/the-hinshelwood-family-portrait-shoot/) speak for themselves. Looking forward to seeing the rest…

    The [Developer Developer Developer](http://developerdayscotland.com) event held at [Glasgow Caledonian University](http://www.gcal.ac.uk/) (my University) yesterday was excellent. Kudos to [Colin Angus Mackay](http://blog.colinmackay.net/) and the other organisers for all of the effort they have put in once again.

    **Everything you wanted to know about refactoring but were afraid to ask!**

    I attended [Gary Short](http://www.garyshort.org)'s session on refactoring and found pretty much everything he had to say had merit. This session was more about the mechanics of refactoring than the theory, but the theory he did cover was very useful. I especially liked is analogy about code debt. Those things that you just do quickly or in a less than optimal way incur a kind of code debt that you have to pay back at some point otherwise your software will be to waited down to maintain properly.

    I only wish that some of my companies developers and especially the IT management had attended. I for one will be taking away that refactoring necessary to part of your iterations. Having a full iteration for refactoring every few iterations may seam like a lot, but it allows you to pay back that debt in manageable chunks.

    **Embracing a new world - Dynamic languages and .NET**

    [Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/)'s session on dynamic languages was very interesting even though he did get heckled by Gary after having a dig about Gary's “[IronSmalltalk](http://garyshortblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/microblogging-for-march-10-2009/)” project...

    Ben talked about IronRuby and IronPython, both built by Microsoft on top of the new DLR ([Dynamic Language Runtime](http://www.codeplex.com/dlr)) that allows dynamic languages to be built on top of .NET easily. I for one, being a philistine and liking my comfort zone would like to see IronBasic making an appearance. This is not just for my own benefit, but Ben presented a scenario where you would get a user to enter some code into a textbox and have it executed to provide a grater level of customization to your users without them having to compile an assembly. I feel a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Check in Policy coming on :) ) This I feel would benefit from a VB style language that business users, familiar with VB for Office Applications and the macros, could more easily interact with. For example a Check in Policy could allow a project manager to create a custom policy on the fly and have it apply across their project without having to compile an assembly and have it distributed to all of the developer computers...

    **Make Patterns With Patterns - Introducing the MVVM design pattern for WPF**

    The main event for me was **[Ray Booysen](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/)**’s session on [MVVM](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/archive/tags/MVVM/default.aspx). I found his delivery excellent and although there was at least one guy that did not get it, this is the pattern that I have been looking for with WPF. I had been looking at Prism, but this is an MVC WPF implementation and I much prefer the MVVM style, although I think that the Prism framework will support MVVM and it brings dependency injection along with some other mice bits . Ray was compelling and informative and his enthusiasm for this topic pulled most of us in immediately. But, before I can fully commit to MVVM I will need to give it a go, and I have a few ideas…

    [Get the slides](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/nondestructive/archive/2009/05/02/demo-code-and-slides-from-ddd-scotland.aspx)

    **Grok Talks**

    I missed most of the talks, but I got back just in time to see a session about XmlSerilizer verses XamlSerilizer and the sped benefits of using the XamlSerilizer. This was interesting as I had run into some of the same problems myself and opted for the third way which is the WcfSerilizer which provides the benefit over the XamlSerilizer that it can sterilize generic types and over the XmlSerilizer that it can sterilize IDictionary objects as well.

    **When good architecture goes bad**

    Taking a different approach than Gary's session on code debt [Mark Dalgarno](http://blog.software-acumen.com/) went further and provided an interactive session on architectural atrophy that showed why a long running product can suffer for a kind of Architectural degradation if the architectural team is not strong enough to make sure that the developers do not deviate from the architecture over time. If the developers have an architectural change that is necessary then it should be presented to the architects who take this on board and modify the overall architecture allowing the change to be incorporated more fully into the overall solution. Again a session that my management and team leads should attend. Especially when either of the scenarios used could have applied to them. In fact the whole talk could have been based on my company.

    **ASP.NET 4.0**

    Although I was in the room, I could not say that I attended this session as I was suffering from a late night and an early rise, and by the time this session started I was starting to drift off. Sorry [Mike](http://mikeo.co.uk/), it was not you, it was me...

    It took me longer than I thought it would to find this, but is you are using TFS2008 and you want builds to fail if any of the tests fail then you can add the following to the tests properties group in your build project (TFSBuild.prof)

    ```
    <PropertyGroup>
      <!-- TEST ARGUMENTS
       If the RunTest property is set to true, then particular tests within a
       metadata file or test container may be specified here.  This is
       equivalent to the /test switch on mstest.exe.

    I need a little bit of code to get the last processed date for the cube that my site connects to:

    ```
    Public Function GetCubeLastProcessedDates(ByVal AnalysisServer As String) As Collection(Of CubeInfo)
        Dim result As Collection(Of CubeInfo)
        Dim identity As WindowsIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()
        Dim eCode As Integer = CommonUtility.RevertToSelf()
        Dim oServer As New Server
        Try
            result = New Collection(Of CubeInfo)
            oServer.Connect(String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "data Source = {0};", AnalysisServer))

            For Each d As Database In oServer.Databases
                For Each c As Cube In d.Cubes
                    result.Add(New CubeInfo(d.Name, c.Name, c.LastProcessed))
                Next
            Next

            oServer.Disconnect()
        Catch e As ConnectionException
            ' Do some error handling
        Catch e As AdomdErrorResponseException
            ' Do some error handling
        Catch e As AdomdConnectionException
            ' Do some error handling
        Catch e As Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AmoException
            ' Do some error handling
        Catch e As Exception
            Throw
        Finally
            oServer.Dispose()
            identity.Impersonate()
        End Try
        '------------------------------
        Return result
    End Function
    ```

    The only problem I have with this is that while it takes no longer than 5 seconds to return a negative result, it can take as much as 30 seconds to return when in the positive (i.e. you can access the cube).

    This makes it a threading only, and more than that, a nice to have only. If this is critical information then you will just have to wait…

    Coming hot on the heals of Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR is the [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR R2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) which features some new bits and better support for SQL 2008.

    You can get a full description over at the [Microsoft Download site](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en), but this new version of [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) has a number of feature enhancements and bug fixes included in the release…

    If you are an avid [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) user then you will need no encouragement to update, but if you are not and you do any sort of database development then you should take a look, as even with the substantial learning or conversion curve, it will provide the sort of benefits that only .NET code developers have had in the past along with a few other enhancements just for you…

    Have you ever wanted to be able to deploy a new version of your database from a USB memory stick and have it automatically produce a differencing script and run it against the target :)

    I have looked at this topic before but I just got my hands on a new Wrox book called “[Professional Microsoft Sharepoint 2007 Development using Microsoft Silverlight 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470434007?ie=UTF8&tag=marthinssblog-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470434007)”, phew, could that title be any longer!

    At only £16 pounds don't expect a 1000 pager, but at just under 300 pages the content is good. It is pretty heavy on code with endless pages of it, but even if you take them out, there is some good content in there. If you have figured out how to deploy Silverlight to Sharepoint then I can’t promise you will learn anything, but if this is your first outing, I think you will find some useful ideas and methods.

    The book takes you through all of the essentials, creating Custom Field types, Branding and custom web parts with Silverlight along with data interaction to produce a slick little training site. There are even some bits on deploying solutions and debugging against Sharepoint. Not bad for the price…

    If you are in any way involved in or thinking bout Testing code, Websites or Web Services then you should have a look at the [VSTT Quick Reference Guide 1.0](http://vstt2008qrg.codeplex.com/) which the [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") Rangers team has published on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex").

    If only this had been published weeks ago when I was delving into the world of web and load test I would have had a much easier time as most of the problems that I encountered have solutions offered right here in this document.

    Here is a summary of the document from the horses mouth:

    > **Summary**
    >
    > This document is a collection of items from public blog sites, Microsoft® internal discussion aliases
    >
    > (sanitized) and experiences from various Test Consultants in the Microsoft Services Labs. The idea is to
    >
    > provide quick reference points around various aspects of Microsoft Visual Studio® Team Test edition
    >
    > that may not be covered in core documentation, or may not be easily understood. The different types of
    >
    > information cover:
    >
    > · How does this feature work under the covers?
    >
    > · How can I implement a workaround for this missing feature?
    >
    > · This is a known bug and here is a fix or workaround.
    >
    > · How do I troubleshoot issues I am having?
    >
    > This Ranger solution is the result of an on-going multi-year cooperation with Microsoft Services Labs. Some of you might still remember the exciting news after over one year of cooperation with members of Services Labs which resulted in booting our competitor off our campus. Our message was, “yes we admit that we don’t have feature parity with the market leader in testing but we have a flexible framework and can extend and customize to fill the gaps”. In a team effort with Services Labs, we managed to beat Mercury in one of the largest Services engagements (Motorola/911 public project).
    >
    > Services Labs is a professional testing center and until that point, they had specialized in delivering enterprise level professional testing services but their primary tooling was not VSTT. After switching to our products, they had the challenge of mapping their testing knowledge to VSTT which was not as mature as the competitors products. Their test engineers and test consultants had to figure out how to tweak our tools  and find workarounds to do the same testing procedures. The result is a concentrated reference book with 80 pages of no-nonsense prescriptive guide.

    As you can see this document is not a theoretical document, but a real world problems, real world solutions kinda thing that  has been created with a lot of hard work and customer interaction…

    Well done Rangers…

    Although if you are a Windows 7 user like me, you will not be able to download the newly released [Internet Explorer 8](http://www.microsoft.com/ie8), if you have XP or Vista you can dive into the experience that many people have been using for a while now.

    [![image](images/1-1.png)](images/1-1.png)
    { .post-img }

    Join the party and [download Internet Explorer 8](http://www.microsoft.com/ie8) today…

    This is, as you would expect, the best browser from Microsoft to date. And yes, may other browsers are faster… but no other offers the level of compatibility and extensibility offered by IE. I have used Firefox and Google Chrome, and often have Firefox installed for those times when IE will not cooperate, but I always get frustrated and go back to Internet Explorer….

    UPDATE (2009-03-23): Apparently an independent study study by Microsoft has shown that IE8 is faster than Firefox and Chrome! I will be using IE8 even if that is not true :)

    Microsoft has just released a new [Training Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=130354)  for [Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/windowsazure.mspx) that updates the one released at the PDC. Not since [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") and WPF have I been so exited about a new technology, but [Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/windowsazure.mspx) is it.

    { .post-img }

    If you are not really sure what Azure is, it is a set of services that can be wired together with custom Cloud services to create dynamically scaling services and applications. It’s a little more complicated than that ;) but you get the jist.

    The Live services piece is the cream of the crop for providing services to your applications. I am still trying to get access to the CTP so I can super charge my [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://codeplex.com/tfsstickybuddy) application….

    The Azure Services Training Kit February update now includes the following content covering Windows Azure, .NET Services, SQL Services, and Live Services:

    - 13 hands-on labs – including 3 new hands-on labs for the Live Framework & Services
    - 19 new demo scripts – These demo scripts are designed to provide detailed walkthroughs of key features so that someone can easily give a demo of a service
    - 10 new scripted presentations – the presentations used for our 3 day training workshops including detailed speaker notes.

    Over the last month I have been reading [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596007124?ie=UTF8&tag=dyslexicdev-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0596007124)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=dyslexicdev-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0596007124). This an excellent book and I only wish that all tech books used some of the principals of learning that are contained in it. As [Jeff Attwood](http://www.codinghorror.com) has [noted](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000380.html) there are some problems with the content of this book, but the thing that I love is it’s, and all the other books in the [Head First](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) series ability to interact with your brain in a more effective manor.
    { .post-img }

    If you are dyslexic or indeed have any sort of learning difficulty caused by the way information is imparted in our society then you will love this book. Even if you don't then the same disability principals apply… If is easier for people with particular problems to use then that makes it easier for everyone.

    The idea is that the way your brain LIKES to assimilate information is not conducive to a lot of reading. Have you ever read a whole chapter of a tech book, and then thought to yourself, “What was that chapter about?”. This is because, unless your brain is stimulated it will usually disregard the information as irrelevant.

    The [Head First](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) series uses pictures and concepts to encourages your brain to produce chemicals in order to trick it into remembering more of the information.

    I would recommend this book to any budding and exiting author of technical books…

    This was my second attempt at installing Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7 and I ran into a little problem.

    It failed when trying to install the Microsoft Document Explorer 2008. A quick check found the file in WCUDExplore of your installation media, and running the install manually solved that problem…

    We have just had another addition to the family… Kaiden Ryan William Hinshelwood was born at 12:01 on 5th February 2009.

    If you remember 19 months ago when my daughter was born my wife has a [very quick delivery](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/25/The-Delivery.aspx), 45 minutes to be precise. Well it was quicker this time. She went into labour at 11:55am and my son was born at 12:01pm :) Luckily we were already at the hospital for an induction as my wife had been in distress for some weeks…

    [![2009-02-06 003](images/TheDeliveryMkII_65F4-2009-02-06-003_thumb-2-3.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TheDeliveryMkII_65F4-2009-02-06-003.jpg)

    Kaiden is getting on well with his sister, but she does keep trying to shove his “Nonie” (my daughters name for a Dummy/pacifier) in his face wither he wants it or not.

    We have needed a new laptop in the Hinshelwood household for a while now. My old laptop was 8 years old, and although it was a mobile desktop, it ran Vista like a dog… Now the main use of a laptop in our household is for internet and pictures, but I defiantly wanted to run Windows 7.

    My wife's only caveat was that it had to be pink!

    [![JadieLap](images/NewlaptopandWindows7_69D8-JadieLap_thumb-2-3.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NewlaptopandWindows7_69D8-JadieLap_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    I know, but it upped the WAF from about a 3 to a 10.

    If you are looking for a cheap quality laptop in the UK then you should look no further than Tesco Direct. Scary eigh… but true…

    We picked up this [Dell Studio 15 PDC T3400 4GB 250GB 15.4"](http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.205-2678.aspx) for £550.

    Its a pretty good laptop. even if it is pink :)

    [![image](images/NewlaptopandWindows7_69D8-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-NewlaptopandWindows7_69D8-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    And it runs Windows 7 like a dream. Most of the features are actually faster than Vista, but I did install Windows 7 64x and not the 32x OS that it came with.

    With this setup I will not only get my wife's opinion of Windows 7 as a complete non technical, but I will be able to do some of the beta

    tasks that are set us on the [connect site](http://connect.microsoft.com/) without having to boot a virtual computer in work…

    P.S. If I can get the WAF value up I will get myself a [Dell Studio XPS16 T6400 4GB 320GB Blu-Ray 16" Laptop](http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.205-4343.aspx), but I will not be holding my breath…

    We are getting a new carpet tomorrow… my wife is 8 and a half months pregnant and she’s nesting…

    [![iStock_000002524909XnestSmall](images/FunwithVirgin_13775-iStock_000002524909XnestSmall_thumb-1-1.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FunwithVirgin_13775-iStock_000002524909XnestSmall_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    So we cleared the living room and cut up the carpet to dispose of (the carpet fitters charge £25 to get rid of the old carpet, and my wife decided that that was too much…you can’t ague with a pregnant woman.)

    Well, with the TV in the back room and the Virgin+ box in the front, I though I could just bring down my daughters 15” pink LCD and connect it up…

    No picture! Dough… its set for HDMI and the hardware manufacturer in there infinite wisdom has decided that when the HDMI is active SCART is disabled. Not this poses some problems with some TV’s that are slow to respond, but is positively disastrous when you now only have SCART .

    [![VirginHDbox](images/FunwithVirgin_13775-VirginHDbox_thumb-2-2.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-FunwithVirgin_13775-VirginHDbox_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    How did I solve this conundrum you ask! The same way I always do and whipped out Google… for which I had to scramble over to the back of the now overly crowded back room to retrieve my laptop.

    What you nee to do is this:

    Press reset on the box and hold down play and stop on the front of the box until it says boot the little screen. After a couple of minutes it will say “1nput” in a digital watch kinda way. Use the fast forward (>>) button on the front of the box to select “5d” and then press OK. Now reset your box again and you should have a picture….

    Have you ever, when developing a website, been frustrated when you get a different result when you deploy your application to [http://site/](http://site/) and [http://site/app/](http://site/app/).

    [![iStock_000001095647XSmall](images/ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-iStock_000001095647XSmall_thumb-3-3.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-iStock_000001095647XSmall_2.jpg)
    { .post-img }

    I don’t know about you, but it annoys the hell out of me. All that work in CSS and none of your images work when you run it in a different location. This would be especially frustrating when you are running multiple feature branches and need Kerberos interaction. The amount of work required to get Kerberos to work (SPN’s, URL’s, Delegation and AD) limits the number of sites you can have in an enterprise environment.

    I have just two. I have a site for the latest candidate release and one to host all of my feature branches. As I am using TFS I identify my Feature with either a Requirement or Change Request Id and name everything after this.

    Thus I have [http://site/](http://site/) and [http://site-dev/1345](http://site-dev/1345). This makes it easy to find and test, and my CI build at the ends of the day just overwrites the previous version.

    This means that all of your css like this…

    ```
    .down {
       padding-right:14px;
       background: url('/UI/Resources/Images/arrow_down.gif') no-repeat 100% 50%;
    }
    ```

    …will not work in one of your locations :( This makes me sad…

    So, in order to cheer up your CSS, you can give it a little bit of .NET Omph…

    The first thing you need to do is get .NET to handle ALL of your requests, and not just for the ASP.NET pages.

    [![image](images/ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ReformatyourCSSonthefly_E44D-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Add a “Wildcard application mapping” to the “aspnet_isapi.dll” and you are good to go…

    To process the css we need an HttpHandler, this is dead easy to implement and action so:

    ```
    Imports System.Web
    Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions


    Public Class CssHttpHandler
        Implements IHttpHandler

        Public ReadOnly Property IsReusable() As Boolean Implements System.Web.IHttpHandler.IsReusable
            Get
                Return False
            End Get
        End Property

        Public Sub ProcessRequest(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext) Implements System.Web.IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest
            context.Response.ContentType = "text/css"

            'Get the file from the query stirng
            Dim File As String = context.Request.FilePath

            ' Find the actual path
            Dim Path As String = context.Server.MapPath(File)

            'Limit to only css files
            If Not System.IO.Path.GetExtension(Path) = ".css" Then
                context.Response.End()
            End If

            'Make sure file exists
            If Not System.IO.File.Exists(Path) Then
                context.Response.End()
            End If


            ' Open the file, read the contents and replace the variables
            Using css As System.IO.StreamReader = New System.IO.StreamReader(Path)
                Dim cssText As String = css.ReadToEnd()

                ' Replace url's
                Dim rximg As New Regex("url('*(.+?)'*)")
                For Each m As Match In rximg.Matches(cssText)
                    cssText = cssText.Replace(m.Groups(1).Value, HandleRootOperator(m.Groups(1).Value))
                Next

                context.Response.Write("/* Please use the ~ operator in front of all URL's. e.g. url('~/UI/Resources/Images/Image.gif') will be converted at runtime to point at the root of the application. */" & vbCrLf & cssText)
            End Using

        End Sub

        ' Methods
        Public Function HandleRootOperator(ByVal virtualUrl As String) As String
            If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(virtualUrl) Then
                If virtualUrl.StartsWith("^~/", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then
                    Return ("^" & Me.applicationPath & virtualUrl.Substring(2))
                End If
                If virtualUrl.StartsWith("~/", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then
                    Return (Me.applicationPath & virtualUrl.Substring(1))
                End If
            End If
            Return virtualUrl
        End Function




        ' Fields
        Private applicationPath As String = IIf((HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath.Length > 1), HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath, String.Empty)


    End Class
    ```

    Now add the Handler to you web.config

    ```
    <httpHandlers>
      <add verb="*" path="*.css" type="Company.System.Product.CssHttpHandler, Company.System.Product" />
    </httpHandlers>
    ```

    Yesterday Microsoft released the latest version of it new IE8 browser. As an avid user of both Beta 1 and Beta 2 I am looking forward to seeing the result. A CR should have most if not all of the performance improvements that will end up in the final release, so I hope all of the small problems that I had with the beta are fixed…

    As some of you may know, Feedburner ([http://feedburner.com](http://feedburner.com)) was acquired some time ago by Google… But they are now actively migrating their content to Google servers ([http://feedburner.google.com](http://feedburner.google.com "http://feedburner.google.com")) and I have taken the plunge… if you are having any problems with my feeds then please let me know so I can rectify it…

    If you have not yet taken the plunge it is a fairly simple process and should not impact your existing posts and URL’s…

    That said I can imagine that it is quite a complicated process behind the scenes and although a redirect is setup from your [http://feeds.feedburner.com/MartinHinshelwood](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MartinHinshelwood)  URL’s to your new  [http://feeds2.feedburner.com/MartinHinshelwood](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/MartinHinshelwood "http://feeds2.feedburner.com") this will incur and additional overhead that will affect the load speed. To remove that overhead, you need to change all of your feed URL’s…

    { .post-img }

    Although you do get less options, Google has promised that more functionality will be added and that the stats will be more accurate…

    We will see…

    I was a little lazy last time and did not install either Team Explorer, or SP1 on my visual studio instance. So, lets get to it…

    [![Installing Team Explorer 2008 on Windows 7](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Everything fine with the Team Explorer install so far, but I have seen other people with this working as well. The fun seams to start when you get SP1 out of the bag, so we will start by Connecting to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), and using [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://codeplex.com/tfsstickybuddy)…

    [![Team Explorer 2008 installed sucessfully on Windows 7](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Yea baby!

    [![Team Explorer Proxy problems](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    Well it looks like I have been hampered by my proxy server at work… no way round that one… I can get web pages, but application can’t connect…

    [![Connected to Codeplex](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    And, not a proxy issue after all, but a firewall issue! Still can’t get the “Send Feedback” to sign in… now that is probably a proxy/websence issue…

    [![Failed to connect to Source Control](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb_4-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    This is a new one on me, and I needed to threaten Visual Studio with the “End Task” button to get it to respond… Maybe I need SP1 on Windows 7?

    Tune in next time for some SP1 antics…

    P.S. [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://codeplex.com/tfsstickybuddy) works, but I think I am going to need a blue theme…

    [![TFS Sticky Buddy on Windows 7](images/InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_thumb_5-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingTeamExplorerandVisualStudio200_E718-image_12.png)

    Ewww, and check out that nasty logo…

    In my email signature, and in the title of my blog, I have the phrase “multi-dimensional free thinker”, and I was recently pulled up for it…

    > _How do you "know" you are a "free thinker"?  You can't prove that maaaan – at least not to me!  
    > \--Mark Buchner_

    [![Hippy Dude](images/AmIastonerhippy_146A1-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-AmIastonerhippy_146A1-image_2.png)Thanks Mark… but he has a point… Am I some kind of stoner hippy? Is that why I can’t spell?
    { .post-img }

    Even though that sounds nice for a while (I miss University), it is neither the source of the phrase nor is it the cause of my spelling problems… In fact it is more than spelling, I sometimes find it difficult to keep up with the stuff coming out of my brain. My inability to write with a pen properly, yup, and write to save myself is also a symptom of the same thing, and you should see me knocking thing over and generally being clumsy.

    These things are all symptoms of something generally called [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") but may other mislabels have been applied to it; Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD/ADHD), Dyscalculia/Acalculia, Dysgraphia/Agraphia, and Hyperactivity, all of which I have been accused of. You may call this a disability, and most do, but it is really a gift.

    The more you read about [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") the more you you find things that sound cool…

    > _The way pupils are taught today is counterproductive for people with a creative, visual and multidimensional thinking style. Like the sportsman who needs the right clothing to reach peak performance, pupils with [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") need to be taught in a way that suits their learning style.  
    > BBC -_ [_http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/llandeilo/pages/caroline_keen.shtml_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/llandeilo/pages/caroline_keen.shtml)

    The current education system, pretty much the world over, has some deficits where, funnily enough, learning is concerned. A full third of the population of the world and 80% if the population of Scottish prisons have “dyslexic tendencies”, whatever that is. These people have a disadvantage in the current system because of there lack of 2-d perception.

    > _The right-brained and dyslexic thinker will most often have the ability to collect vast amounts of information on a topic, comprehend it on many analytical levels and then use it in a wide array of creative applications. The right-brained person is generally not satisfied until all possibilities are gathered and added to the “whole picture” and then utilized.

    I have heard of a number of companies who will only employ dyslexic people for particular jobs, the most notable of which is a Architectural company that has only dyslexic Architects because of their enhanced multidimensional perception.

    > _Ron Davis explains that multi-dimensional thinking (using all the senses) takes place much faster than verbal thinking. Dyslexics also tend to be more curious, creative, and intuitive than average. They tend to be highly aware of the environment, inventive, and good at real world tasks. Their special mode of thought also produces the gift of mastery: once they have learned something experientially, they understand it on such a deep level that they know how to do things intuitively without thinking about how.

    There are many famous dyslexic people the world over, including: Walt Disney, Tom Cruise, Thomas Edison, Babe Ruth, Alexander Graham Bell, and John F. Kennedy and Agatha Christi who reportedly could not spell to save herself… thank god for good editors…

    I am installing VS2008 in a virtual environment, so this may not be exactly what you would get, but the purpose is to identify if VS2008 does indeed work on Windows 7 and what the experience is like.

    The first problem is that the auto run does not seam to function.

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Auto-Run](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    This can be rectified by browsing the CD / Image and running setup.exe

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Setup](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    So far so good.

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Welcome to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 installation wizard](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    After you have accepted the licence agreement you need to select the installation components.

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Welcome to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 feature selection](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    I am selecting Full so we can make sure it all goes on, but usually I remove SQL Express as I would add SQL Server developer edition later.

    { .post-img }

    It’s that guy again :), we need to let this cook for “some time, or considerably longer”…

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Welcome to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Installing Components](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_5-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    Some time later….

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Welcome to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Install Complete](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_6-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_14.png)
    { .post-img }

    After some 2 hours (remember I am in a virtual computer)

    I now have Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit installed…

    [![Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008: Welcome to the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008](images/InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_thumb_7-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingVisualStudio2008TeamSuitonWind_C6BE-image_16.png)
    { .post-img }

    I will need to service pack it and check functionality, probably by working on the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://codeplex.com/tfsstickybuddy) project on it and making sure that I an still deploy and run on other platforms! That is for another day though…

    Installing Windows 7 is so similar to the Vista install it almost does not deserve a post on it, but as I did not do a Vista install post, and I am waiting for the install to complete, I though you should see, erm…. the nice new colours…

    I am installing on a virtual environment (Virtual PC) on my desktop so any timings for the install are largely irrelevant, but my Host computer had Dual Quad core Xeon’s and some serious HDD and RAM speeds.

    [![Windows Vista Host Experiance Index](images/InstallingWindows7_679C-image_thumb_7-14-14.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingWindows7_679C-image_16.png)

    I only get a 3.3 because my graphics card is not a very expensive one…

    ### Install

    For some reason the “Upgrade” option was available! Bug maybe…

    I was quite surprised to see that I got this far in around 10 minutes… I barely have time too keep up with my post!

    All in all, a very nice experience so far… I will probably be running at home as well, but I do not expect that install to take 25 minutes!

    My computer at home is a P4 3.1Ghz with 1GB of ram… :(

    If you have an [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com) account you will be able to download [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/default.aspx) Beta today, but it should be available for anyone by the end of next week.

    If you have not seen anything about Windows 7 then you should take a look. I am not suggesting that you install it on a production computer, but even early adopters have had very stable installs.

    The [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/default.aspx) operating system is to Vista as XP was to Windows 2000. If you look under the covers of these operating system you will find that Windows 2000 was version 5.0 and XP was 5.1. This is the same in Windows 7 with Vista being 6.0 and Windows 7 being 6.1.

    And as with windows XP it starts from a stable place, and build from there.

    I am still downloading the beta as we speak, but I will do a little blogging on the install and result :)

    **UPDATE: Windows 7 Beta will be available to the general public from Friday 9th January 2009 (today), but there will only be 2.5 million licences issued.**

    Well, that's me well and truly back from my holidays, a nice relaxing couple of weeks spent at home with my family.

    As a kind of New Years present, Microsoft has released a free learning initiative for those of you that are or will be using Visual Studio 2008. I am taking it myself as a way to make sure that I have not missed anything :)
