    Up until now the only avenue for your average Vista user for support was to trawl the MSDN Forums, Technet Forums and the Support site for some elusive piece of information that is buried among all that technical BS that we teckies like to call help.

    All that has now changed with the addition of the [Answers](http://social.answers.microsoft.com/) forum!

    This will be a no nonsense, non technical forum for real users to get real answers. The forum will follow the format that he user sees in the control panel of Vista so here are the topics:

    #### Windows Vista Forums

    Tap into the expertise and enthusiasm of Windows Vista customers and Microsoft support professionals.

    Now, for those Blue badge holders and us MVP’s that have been asked to moderate there are strict rules around making sure that both the Questions and the Answers are non threatening and non technical.

    These forums are specifically targeted at Vista, but if they are successful, there may be more forums added in the future. Maybe for things like Sharepoint and Office, and it may include many other products (deliberately vague).

    Lets get [Answering](http://social.answers.microsoft.com/)…but remember, no techno-babble!

    If only I could be as eloquent as Scott. His recent post on “[Does test-driven development speed up development?](http://blog.scottbellware.com/2008/12/does-test-driven-development-speed-up.html)” really gets to the crux of an endemic problem in the Software Development industry, especially in companies for whom Software Development is not their core business.

    > Test-driven development decreases complexity, improves the incremental adaptability that software product development depends on, astronomically reduces the amount of rework that destabilizes schedules, and reduces the unrecognized design flaws that decrease productivity after the initial implementation phase.

    > Test-driven development supports flow. The software development industry at large is years away from recognizing that flow rather than efficiency is what creates giant leaps in productivity. Nonetheless, it works, and it's supported by the production physics used by industries that are well ahead of software development in product development and production maturity and optimization.

    If, like me, you tried to deploy a solution to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and it ether failed or hung you will need to remove it somehow. But once the status has moved to “deploying”, if you receive an error like this:

    > Error: The web.config is invalid on this IIS Web Site: C:InetpubwwwrootwssVirtualDirectoriessearch.xxx.xxx.biz80web.config.

    You will need to manually remove the job.

    To do this, go to the Central Administration portal and under the “Global Configuration” section on the “Operations” tab select “Job Timer definitions”

    [![image](images/RemovingadeadSolutionDeploymentfromMOSS2_C4E5-image_thumb-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingadeadSolutionDeploymentfromMOSS2_C4E5-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    This will take you to a massive list of all the scheduled and on demand jobs. Check down the list to find the job you want to kill, the Deployment operations will have “one-time” in the last column.

    ![image](images/RemovingadeadSolutionDeploymentfromMOSS2_C4E5-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Click the title to bring up the job definition and status and you should have the kill switch readily available

    [![image](images/RemovingadeadSolutionDeploymentfromMOSS2_C4E5-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingadeadSolutionDeploymentfromMOSS2_C4E5-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    Once killed you can check the deployments page and you will see that there is nothing trying to “deploy”.

    Some of the new Windows Live Wave 3 services have gone live over the last couple of days. One of the best IMO is the [SkyDrive services](http://skydrive.live.com), updated to 25GB and with complete integration with other services like [Photo Share](http://photos.live.com), [Connect to people](http://profile.live.com/connect)…

    [![image](images/SkyDrive25GBoffreeonlinestorage_7F5A-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-SkyDrive25GBoffreeonlinestorage_7F5A-image_2.png)

    You can connect to your Facebook and LinkedIn contacts as well :)

    A nice feature is the ability to link your live accounts so you can easily switch from your clever \[yourname\]@\[yourdomain\].com to your nasty \[yourname\]@live.com address.

    As you can see from the menu structure, all of your services are all in one place, although some of those other services, OneCare for example, have not yet been updated as you can’t get back into the same bits… I am sure it will come…

    The SkyDrive service has had a major overall and has a nice new home page as well as the integration with Live Photo and a whopping 25gb of space…

    I have been getting very interested in the new [Azure Services Platform](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/register.mspx) and how I can use it to facilitate WPF development.

    [![image](images/LiveFrameowrk_A25C-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-LiveFrameowrk_A25C-image_2.png)

    Imagine being able to launch a ClickOnce application from anywhere and for it to have exactly the same configuration and settings in all locations, or imagine being able to chat with other users of the application while you are using it.

    This things have been relegated to large companies who can afford to support the infrastructure that you would need to run this. In fact, the only industry that I can think of that currently does this with applications is the Gaming industry. If you look at the capabilities of Xbox Live and think of all the cool things your users could achieve if the same communication and collaboration tools were available within even the simplest application.

    For example, if I was to think of a couple of simple things that I would like the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://codeplex.com/tfsstickybuddy) to be able to do:

    - Central storage for configuration (single setup across multiple computers)
    - Chat with members of your team to be identified by linking your Team System login and email with you Live ID.
    - Presence information on those team members, or anyone you might need to interact with.

    Coool…..

    Updated and improved for Team System 2008.

    [![vsts_thumb[2]](images/TFSEventHandlerv1.3released_9AE8-vsts_thumb2_-2-2.png)](/Users/martihins/AppData/Local/Temp/WindowsLiveWriter1286139640/supfiles13CE4A31/vsts2.png)
    { .post-img }

    [http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler "http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler")

    The TFS Event Handler makes it easier to notify users of changes to Work Items in Team Foundation Server. You will no longer need to add individual alerts to users.

    It is developed in .NET 3.5 SP1 for Team Foundation Server 2008 and is deployed as a system service.

    **I have added support for groups. If you add a TFS group into the Assigned To drop down all members of that group will receive notifications!**

    You will need to allow groups in your Assigned to list. Below is a snippet from me Bug work item type as it stands at the moment.

    ```
       1: <FIELD reportable="dimension" type="String" name="Assigned To" refname="System.AssignedTo">
    ```

    ```
       2:     <HELPTEXT>The person assigned to act on the bug, either to fix it or to verify the fix</HELPTEXT>
    ```

    ```
       3:     <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />
    ```

    ```
       4:     <ALLOWEDVALUES filteritems="excludegroups">
    ```

    ```
       5:         <LISTITEM value="[project]Contributors" />
    ```

    ```
       6:     </ALLOWEDVALUES>
    ```

    ```
       7: </FIELD>
    ```

    You can see on line 4 that there is a filter for excluding the groups from the list. If you are using [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) v1.0 or v1.1 then you will need this line. If you install the new [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler) v1.3 then you will be able to remove that and start assigning work items to Groups.

    **Note: Although they will now get an email, the work item will not appear in their “My Work items” query. You may want to consider creating a Query for each Group.**

    The Alerts that you no longer need users to individually setup are:

    - A work item is assigned to you, or a group you are a member of.

    - A work item that is assigned to you, or a group you are a member of is, reassigned to someone else.

    - A work item that you created is assigned to someone else, or a group.

    There is also a framework for [creating and deploying your own event handlers](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Wiki/View.aspx?title=TFS%20Event%20Handlers%20v1.0&referringTitle=Home) that can do pretty much whatever you want. One of the shipped examples updates “Heat ITSM” whenever a work item that contains a Heat Id is changed.

    This is a lot harder than it sounds. At first you think there will be a built in option with the [Read Identities](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.igroupsecurityservice.readidentities.aspx) method on the [IGroupSecurityService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.igroupsecurityservice.aspx) Interface, but you would be wrong!

    When capturing an event from Team Foundation Server you have access to a lot of information about the change, including the Display Name of the fields for Assigned To and Changed By.

    But what if you allow Work Items to be assigned to groups! First, lets achieve that. Create a group called “Program Management” on a project and add it into the “Contributors” list. We have a group for each of the advocacy groups in the CMMI process.

    Edit your “Task” work item definition (you can use the power tools process editor or just edit the XML) and alter the Assigned To field to be the following:

    ```
       1: <FIELD reportable="dimension" type="String" name="Assigned To" rename="System.AssignedTo">
    ```

    ```
       2:   <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />
    ```

    ```
       3:   <ALLOWEDVALUES>
    ```

    ```
       4:     <LISTITEM value="[project]Contributors" />
    ```

    ```
       5:   </ALLOWEDVALUES>
    ```

    ```
       6: </FIELD>
    ```

    Once you have updated your project you should be able to see all of the users as well as this new group displayed. If you were to assign a task to this group, how would you email everyone in that group so that they know they have been assigned something at all?

    Well this needs a wee tweak of the [TFS Event Handler](http://codeplex.com/tfseventhandler)  to handle this, I will be releasing the full in place code with the TFS Event Handler v1.3 drop, but you can download my little test app I used to get it all working.

    \[[Download Project](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/CodeDrop/TFS%20Identity%20Retreval%20Test.rar "Download TFS Identity Retreval Test Source")\]

    You can enter a display name of either a user or a group. And here is how it is done:

    There is a little but of Active Directory lookup using a little method called GetUsername

    ```
       1: '' <summary>
    ```

    ```
       2: '' Retrieves a user's email address from Active Directory based on their display name
    ```

    ```
       3: '' </summary>
    ```

    ```
       4: Public Shared Function GetUsername(ByVal userDisplayName As String) As String
    ```

    ```
       5:     Dim ds As DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher = New DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher()
    ```

    ```
       6:     ds.PropertiesToLoad.Add("sAMAccountName")
    ```

    ```
       7:     ds.Filter = String.Format("(&(displayName={0})(objectCategory=person)((objectClass=user)))", userDisplayName)
    ```

    ```
       8: 
    ```

    ```
       9:     Dim results As DirectoryServices.SearchResultCollection = ds.FindAll()
    ```

    ```
      10:     If results.Count = 0 Then
    ```

    ```
      11:         Return String.Empty
    ```

    ```
      12:     End If
    ```

    ```
      13:     Dim values As DirectoryServices.ResultPropertyValueCollection = results(0).Properties("sAMAccountName")
    ```

    ```
      14:     If values.Count = 0 Then
    ```

    ```
      15:         Return String.Empty
    ```

    ```
      16:     End If
    ```

    ```
      17:     Return values(0).ToString()
    ```

    ```
      18: End Function
    ```

    This retrieves the users sAMAccountName (or username) from Active Directory. Easy enough, and I already had it kicking about…

    But in order to retrieve an identity that you are not sure is a group or a user, you will need to try to get the Group Identity first. This is because it is faster to wade through a maximum of 20 groups than potentially hundreds of users [mentioned on the MSDN Forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsworkitemtracking/thread/413bd663-707b-41af-83c7-c92015b0f80f/) answer below.

    ```

    ```
      11:            If Not appGroup Is Nothing Then
    ```

    ```
      12:                appGroup = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.Sid, appGroup.Sid, QueryMembership.Expanded)

      14:                WriteIdentity(appGroup)

    ```
      15:                Exit Try
    ```

    ```
      16:            End If
    ```

    ```
      17:            ' Not app group. Then return user is you can

      19:            Dim usrIdent As Identity = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.AccountName, username, QueryMembership.Expanded)

    ```
      20:            If Not usrIdent Is Nothing Then

    ```
      21:                WriteToLog(String.Format("Recieved identity for {0}", username))
    ```

    ```
      22:                WriteIdentity(usrIdent)
    ```

    ```
      23:                Exit Try
    ```

    ```
      24:            End If
    ```

    ```
      25:            '----------------------------------------
    ```

    ```
      26:            WriteToLog(String.Format("identity for {0} not found", Me.uxDisplayName.Text))
    ```

    ```
      27: 
    ```

    ```
      28:            '----------------------------------------
    ```

    ```
      29:        Catch ex As Exception
    ```

    ```
      30:            Me.uxResults.Items.Add(ex.ToString)
    ```

    ```
      31:        End Try
    ```

    There is a lot going on here, but the first thing you need to do is retrieve the TFS objects that we will need to work with which include a [TeamFoundationServer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.client.teamfoundationserver.aspx) instance as well as an [IGroupSecurityService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.igroupsecurityservice.aspx) and [ICommonStructureService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.icommonstructureservice.aspx). You could use the [WorkItemStore](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitemstore.aspx) instead of the [ICommonStructureService](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.icommonstructureservice.aspx), but the [WorkItemStore](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.workitemtracking.client.workitemstore.aspx) has a heavy performance hit for retrieving an instance.

    ```
       1: Dim svr As New TeamFoundationServer(Me.uxTeamServer.Text)
    ```

    ```
       2: Dim GroupSecurityService As IGroupSecurityService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(IGroupSecurityService)), IGroupSecurityService)
    ```

    ```
       3: Dim CommonStructureService As ICommonStructureService = CType(svr.GetService(GetType(ICommonStructureService)), ICommonStructureService)
    ```

    Next we need to try and retrieve the Identity of the group, if it is one.  The ICommonStructureService  has a method for listing all of the Groups available within a project, but for that you need the project name which in the demo is just entered.

    ```
       1: ' Return App Group if you can
    ```

    ```
       2: Dim pi As ProjectInfo = m_CommonStructureService.GetProjectFromName(Me.uxProject.Text)
    ```

    ```
       3: Dim appGroup As Identity = (From i In m_GroupSecurityService.ListApplicationGroups(pi.Uri) Where i.DisplayName = Me.uxDisplayName.Text).SingleOrDefault
    ```

    ```
       4: If Not appGroup Is Nothing Then
    ```

    ```
       5:   appGroup = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.Sid, appGroup.Sid, QueryMembership.Expanded)
    ```

    ```
       6:   WriteToLog(String.Format("Recieved identity for {0}", Me.uxDisplayName.Text))
    ```

    ```
       7:   WriteIdentity(appGroup)
    ```

    ```
       8:   Exit Try
    ```

    ```
       9: End If
    ```

    What this does is use the project name entered (in the event it is under the element ProtfolioProject (yea, I don’t know why it is called that either) to search a list of Group’s within your project for the one of interest.

    Then, as it does not by default load the “Members” and “MemberOf” arrays you need to call ReadIdentity with the Expand option is you want to list the Members, and I do.

    [![image](images/RetrievinganidentityfromTeamFoundationSe_E782-image_thumb-2-2.png)](images/RetrievinganidentityfromTeamFoundationSe_E782-image_thumb-2-2.png)
    { .post-img }

    If this does not return an identity, then we need to look at the display name being a user account.

    ```
       1: ' Not app group. Then return user is you can
    ```

    ```
       2: Dim username As String = GetUsername(Me.uxDisplayName.Text)
    ```

    ```
       3: Dim usrIdent As Identity = m_GroupSecurityService.ReadIdentity(SearchFactor.AccountName, username, QueryMembership.Expanded)
    ```

    ```
       4: If Not usrIdent Is Nothing Then
    ```

    ```
       5:   WriteToLog(String.Format("Recieved identity for {0}", username))
    ```

    ```
       6:   WriteIdentity(usrIdent)
    ```

    ```
       7:   Exit Try
    ```

    ```
       8: End If
    ```

    Actually quite easy, but it could be easier.

    Example WorkItemChangedEvent:

    ```
       1: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    ```

    ```
       2: <WorkItemChangedEvent xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

    I think that this was an unnecessary complexity and there should be an additional option for the [Search Factor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.teamfoundation.server.searchfactor.aspx) enumeration should be added to make this easier.

    Updated and improved for Team System 2008.

    [![vsts](images/TFSEventHandlerv1.1released_A3AE-vsts_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerv1.1released_A3AE-vsts_2.png)

    [http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler "http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler")

    The [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler makes it easier to notify users of changes to Work Items in Team Foundation Server. You will no longer need to add individual alerts to users.

    It is developed in .NET 3.5 SP1 for Team Foundation Server 2008 and is deployed as a system service.

    The Alerts that you no longer need users to individually setup are:

    - A work item is assigned to you.
    - A work item that is assigned to you is reassigned to someone else.
    - A work item that you created is assigned to someone else.

    There is also a framework for [creating and deploying your own event handlers](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Wiki/View.aspx?title=TFS%20Event%20Handlers%20v1.0&referringTitle=Home) that can do pretty much whatever you want. One of the shipped examples updates “Heat ITSM” whenever a work item that contains a Heat Id is changed.

    Once you get it going the install is pretty easy. Things to watch out for are:

    - Remove all previous versions before the install. This included any CTP or RC versions.
    - You will NOT be able to upgrade your projects built with the CTP releases! You should however be able to upgrade any projects built with the RC.

    > ### Installation
    >
    > #### Uninstall old GDR versions
    >
    > If you have a previous version of the GDR installed, you will have to uninstall these first. You can do this via Add/Remove Programs or from the command line using:
    >
    > · msiexec /X {DDF197C6-4507-3A19-A4B5-0E17CC931370}

    Luckily I have just received a new install of Vista 64, so I have no previous versions to remove ;)

    Once the install if finished you will see that the GDR has replaced the standard Database Edition in visual studio.

    [![About Visual Studio](images/VisualStudioTeamSystem2008DatabaseEditio_967A-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-VisualStudioTeamSystem2008DatabaseEditio_967A-image_2.png) 
    { .post-img }

    The “New Project” window will also have additional options and you can see the two new sort of project, “Database” and “Server”.

    { .post-img }

    If you pick the “Wizard” you will be presented with a set of options for your project creation. Loads of people have documented what these options mean, so I will just give you a flavor with a wee video…

    Please be patient with my videos as I am just getting to grips with this.

    What a mouthful! Has there ever been any products with names as long as the Team System toolset ;), Maybe thats why it is just called [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en).

    Anyway, congratulations to the [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) team for this wonderful piece of work. I have been following the GDR for a while and I have been very impressed with the capabilities on offer.

    Although this is billed as a new release of [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en), it is really a completely new product with a brand new architecture. They have made many improvements to scalability, and they have added many extensibility  points (Microsoft speak for places where you can inject your own functionality).

    ### Model based architecture

    Everything underneath the covers is based on a true model representation of the SQL Server schema. This facilitates a true offline declarative database development system where the source code defines the shapes of the schema objects.

    ### **Database Schema Providers**

    Models are implemented by **Database Schema Providers**, DSP's for short. - The introduction of a provider model enables multiple things at once. First of all the decoupling of release vehicles. For example when SQL Server will release a new version or adds new functionality in a service pack, like they did in SQL Server 2005 SP2 when adding "vardecimal" support, we can simply update an existing provider or provide a new one in case of a new SQL Server release. Overtime we will go to a model where the SQL Server providers will be an integral part of the SQL Server release. The provider model is also a key extensibility point, allowing 3rd parties to extend database project ecosystem and add support for other database platforms in Visual Studio Team System 2010.

    ### Tool extensibility

    In this release external tool writers have full access to the T-SQL parsers (for SQL Server 2000, 2005 and 2008), the SQL Script DOM and the schema model (when inside Visual Studio). This adds on top of the ability to write extend the tools inside the platform. You can extend T-SQL refactoring by writing your own refactoring types (operations) and refactoring targets; add T-SQL Static Code Analysis rules, data generators, data distributions and test conditions. Database Projects (.dbproj) now provide a truly extensible declarative database development platform.

    ### Separation of BUILD and DEPLOY

    The separation of build & deploy makes it possible to deploy the output of your database project to many different targets and different points in time. Build now produces a single artifact file hat describes the schema inside your database, called a .DBSCHEMA file. This file is used by the deployment engine to deploy your schema.

    ### **Standalone Deployment Engine**.

    The inclusion of a standalone and [redistributable](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/22/redist.aspx) deployment engine makes it possible to deploy the output of your database projects (.DBSCHEMA files) to a target database without the need of having Visual Studio Team System Database Edition installed. This enables key scenarios like the inclusion of database schema deployment as part of your application installation.

    Get it now :)

    Here I am slogging my guts out, trying to get [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) v2.0 out the door and bang goes the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server :(

    [![bang](images/Leastopportunetime_CCCD-bang_thumb-1-1.jpg)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Leastopportunetime_CCCD-bang_2.jpg) 
    { .post-img }

    This is tfs05 on the [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com) environment. All the others seem to be running OK, but juts my luck the one I am using is the one that is affected, and nothing on the [Outage page](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=System%20Outage%20Report)! its been 3 hours and nothing. I have emailed them and reported it on the [Discussions](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=40346) page.

    Now, although I am, I am not really complaining as they have provided a fantastic service over the last, what… two years!

    [](http://www.codeplex.com/ "CodePlex Home")

    Hats off to the [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") team, but get the bloody server fixed so I can check in my code!

    It seams that Microsoft is making an attempt to integrate with OpenID. With the announcement that “[Windows Live ID commits to support of OpenID](http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!1745.entry)” I thought a little investigation would be in order.

    You need to setup a new Live ID on the Live-INT service, you can use any email, but make sure that you do not use your production password!

    - Go to [https://login.live-INT.com/](https://login.live-INT.com/) and use the sign-up button to set up a Windows Live ID test account in the INT environment.
    - Go to [https://login.live-int.com/beta/ManageOpenID.srf](https://login.live-int.com/beta/ManageOpenID.srf) to set up your OpenID test alias.

      { .post-img }
      You alias will be “http://openid.live-int.com/\[yourAlias\].

          You can then associate an open ID with a site. Here is the experience with Plaxo:

          [![image](images/WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_4.png)

      { .post-img }
      From the Plaxo homepage, click “Settings”…

          [![image](images/WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_thumb_2-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_6.png)

      { .post-img }
      Then select “Identities” and “Manage your OpenID’s”.

          [![image](images/WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_thumb_3-3-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-WindowsLiveIDandOpenID_9E73-image_8.png)

      { .post-img }
      You can then attach any number of OpenIDs to your Plaxo account. So lets click “Attach a new OpenID”.

      { .post-img }
      And then “SignIn”.

      { .post-img }
      This is where Windows Live takes over from the main sites, and you enter your password for your Live account.

          I am hoping that they will be releasing a version that works for .NET applications and not just websites. This would allow application developers to join the ranks of interconnected authentication application with single sign-on.

          It is a dream I have…

    If, like me, you are interested in using all the new fangled controls produced by every man and his dog, you will probably have come across the [Infragistics](http://infragistics.com) WPF control. My mission, that I stupidly accepted, was to update the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) application with their [XamRibbon](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamRibbon.aspx) and [XamDockManager](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamdockmanager.aspx) controls, and anything else I can stuff in there.

    ![](images/pnp.gif)
    { .post-img }

    The “anything else” I decided to use was the [Composite WPF](http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF) guidance. This is a newer WPF version of the Client Application Block (CAB) packages provided by the Patterns and Practices teams at Microsoft.

    Anyhoo, I though I should give some advice for those of you mixing these technologies. I seam to have licked the [XamRibbon](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamRibbon.aspx) implementation, but I am still working on the [XamDockManager](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamdockmanager.aspx) bits.

    Note: You will need to be familiar with the Composite WPF bits for this all to make sense.

    ```
       1: <igRibbon:XamRibbon  x:Name="uxXamRibbon" cal:RegionManager.RegionName="{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_Ribbon}"

                               AllowMinimize="True" AutoHideEnabled="False" IsMinimized="False">
    ```

    ```
       2:         <igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
       3:           <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu cal:RegionManager.RegionName="{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_RibbonApplicationMenu}"

                                               Image="/Hinshelwood.TFSStickyBuddy;component/RDIcon.ico">
    ```

    ```
       4:             <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>
    ```

    ```
       5:               <igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar cal:RegionManager.RegionName="{x:Static inf:RegionNames.Shell_RibbonApplicationMenuFooterToolbar}">
    ```

    ```
       6:               </igRibbon:ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar>
    ```

    ```
       7:            </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>
    ```

    ```
       8:         </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
       9:      </igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
      10: </igRibbon:XamRibbon>
    ```

    As you can see there are a number of regions here, for the Tabs, the Application Menu and the FooterToolbar. You will need both a XamRibbon and a RibbonTabItem adapter.

    ```
       1: Public Class RibbonRegionAdapter
    ```

    ```
       2:     Inherits RegionAdapterBase(Of XamRibbon)
    ```

    ```
       3:
    ```

    ```
       4:     Private m_regionTarget As XamRibbon
    ```

    ```
       5:
    ```

    ```
       6:     Protected Overrides Sub Adapt(ByVal region As Microsoft.Practices.Composite.Regions.IRegion, ByVal regionTarget As XamRibbon)
    ```

    ```
       7:         m_regionTarget = regionTarget
    ```

    ```
       8:         regionTarget.Tabs.Clear()
    ```

    ```
       9:         AddHandler region.ActiveViews.CollectionChanged, AddressOf OnActiveViewsChanged
    ```

    ```
      10:         For Each v As RibbonTabItem In region.ActiveViews
    ```

    ```
      11:             regionTarget.Tabs.Add(v)
    ```

    ```
      12:         Next
    ```

    ```
      13:
    ```

    ```
      14:     End Sub
    ```

    ```
      15:

    ```

    ```
      17:         Select Case e.Action
    ```

    ```
      18:             Case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add

    ```
      32:
    ```

    ```
      33: End Class
    ```

    I am pretty sure that these can be augmented, and I can think of a few Ideas already, including adding a re-parenting ability to allow menu items to be added to the XAML as well as programmatically added.

    I think I might have to go away and try this…

    I hope everyone is looking forward to the [new Xbox live experience](http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/live/NXE/) that will be going Live tomorrow! Hopefully we are passed the days of the ring of death from the update, unless you have a hacked box :)

    Although I am not really interested in the Avatar piece, I think it will be well worth it. The update process is a little different this time, so you are not surprised there is a video detailing the process.

    I never made it into the [Preview](http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/10/24/the-new-xbox-experience-preview-program.aspx) program this time around, but watch this space for my Avatar tomorrow :)

    Ok, so I lied a little. It is not that cheap, but 30% off an upgrade from a team edition to full Team Suit is nothing to be sniffed at, it could be as much as £1000 off!

    > If your team is using any component edition of Visual Studio Team System 2008 (Development Edition, Test Edition, Architecture Edition, or Database Edition), now’s the time to get more out of your development solution. Step up to the complete Visual Studio Team System 2008 Team Suite, and save 30%. That’s a huge savings to give your development team the full suite of tools - and help them collaborate better than ever during the entire application lifecycle.

    If, like me, you like to have changeable resource files in your application. Wither it is for changing the Theme, or interchanging templates you will need to take special care when using the

    [](http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF)libraries.

    The new version of the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) uses both!

    [![image](images/CompositeWPFandMergedDictionaries_9AD7-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CompositeWPFandMergedDictionaries_9AD7-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    I am using the built in Infragistics theme system, and the first time you select a theme I am just adding a resource file that overrides the default:

    ```
       1: Dim resourceDictionary As ResourceDictionary = ThemeManager.GetResourceSet(theme, ThemeManager.AllGroupingsLiteral)
    ```

    ```
       2: If Not resourceDictionary Is Nothing Then
    ```

    ```
       3:    Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(resourceDictionary)
    ```

    ```
       4: End If
    ```

    This causes an error in the ItemsControlRegionAdapter as WPF seams to redo the region adapters and you get a ItemsControlHasItemsSourceException. You need to change the code to the following (notice the commented out areas):

    ```
       1: /// <summary>
    ```

    ```
       2: /// Adapts an <see cref="ItemsControl"/> to an <see cref="IRegion"/>.
    ```

    ```
       3: /// </summary>
    ```

    ```
       4: /// <param name="region">The new region being used.</param>
    ```

    ```
       5: /// <param name="regionTarget">The object to adapt.</param>
    ```

    ```
       6: protected override void Adapt(IRegion region, ItemsControl regionTarget)
    ```

    ```
       7: {  //Modified by Martin Hinshelwood to allow resource file changes...
    ```

    ```
       8:     //if (regionTarget.ItemsSource != null || (BindingOperations.GetBinding(regionTarget, ItemsControl.ItemsSourceProperty) != null))
    ```

    ```
       9:     //    throw new InvalidOperationException(Resources.ItemsControlHasItemsSourceException);
    ```

    ```
      10:
    ```

    ```
      11:     //If control has child items, move them to the region and then bind control to region. Can't set ItemsSource if child items exist.
    ```

    ```
      12:     if (regionTarget.Items.Count > 0)
    ```

    ```
      13:     {
    ```

    ```
      14:         foreach (object childItem in regionTarget.Items)
    ```

    ```
      15:         {
    ```

    ```
      16:             region.Add(childItem);
    ```

    ```
      17:         }
    ```

    ```
      18:         //Control must be empty before setting ItemsSource
    ```

    ```
      19:         regionTarget.ItemsSource = null;
    ```

    ```
      20:         //regionTarget.Items.Clear();
    ```

    ```
      21:     }
    ```

    ```
      22:     regionTarget.ItemsSource = region.Views;
    ```

    ```
      23: }
    ```

    You will notice that I had to comment out the exception for existing controls as well as the Items.Clear (which is replaced by setting the ItemsSource to nothing). This solves the problem I I have not noticed any adverse reactions.

    The second problem occurs when you do you second set of the theme. at this point you need to remove the existing theme:

    ```
       1: If Not m_CurrentTheme Is Nothing Then
    ```

    ```
       2:       Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Remove(m_CurrentTheme)
    ```

    ```
       3: End If
    ```

    When this happens the region management is redone and you get a further RegionNameExistsException from the RegionManager. Then can be solved by changing the code in the AttachNewRegion method:

    ```
       1: /// <summary>
    ```

    ```
       2: /// Attaches a region to an object and adds it to the region manager.
    ```

    ```
       3: /// </summary>
    ```

    ```
       4: /// <param name="regionTarget">The object to adapt. This is typically a container (i.e a control).</param>
    ```

    ```
       5: /// <param name="regionName">The name of the region to register.</param>
    ```

    ```
       6: /// <exception cref="ArgumentException">When regions collection already has a region registered using <paramref name="regionName"/>.</exception>
    ```

    ```
       7: public void AttachNewRegion(object regionTarget, string regionName)
    ```

    ```
       8: {  //Modified by Martin Hinshelwood to allow resource file changes...
    ```

    ```
       9:     if (Regions.ContainsKey(regionName))
    ```

    ```
      10:         return; //throw new ArgumentException(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Resources.RegionNameExistsException, regionName));
    ```

    ```
      11:
    ```

    ```
      12:     IRegionAdapter regionAdapter = regionAdapterMappings.GetMapping(regionTarget.GetType());
    ```

    ```
      13:     IRegion region = regionAdapter.Initialize(regionTarget);
    ```

    ```
      14:
    ```

    ```
      15:     Regions.Add(regionName, region);
    ```

    ```
      16: }
    ```

    So instead of bombing out when you try to add a region of the same name, it will just ignore it. Not ideal, but necessary.

    There is a new release of the Power Tools for team system. As an MVP I was involved in the trial that started early this month, and I can tell you that a LOT of work has gone into these :)

    [Willy-Peter Schaub's](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/default.aspx) has [posted](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/archive/2008/11/09/visual-studio-team-system-2008-team-foundation-server-power-tools-october-2008-release.aspx) about them and I don’t see as I need to add to his detailed [post](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/archive/2008/11/09/visual-studio-team-system-2008-team-foundation-server-power-tools-october-2008-release.aspx)…

    Lets just say that it will be a while in development. I am trying to implement the Composite Application blocks for WPF from Microsoft in an attempt to make the application more modular. I will be updating and [releasing under the v2.0 CTP](http://hinshelwood.com/downloads/TFSStickyBuddy/v2.0/) version and I have uploaded the installation files. This is a [ClickOnce application](http://hinshelwood.com/downloads/TFSStickyBuddy/v2.0/Hinshelwood.TFSStickyBuddy.application), so you will always have the latest version of the CTP.

    [![image](images/TFSStickyBuddy2.0developmentstarted_AFAD-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddy2.0developmentstarted_AFAD-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    The current version CTP1 has only those changes to allow for the new Navigation and structure options, but More features are on the way.

    I will be working on some new features to the Sticky Buddy application. Improvements in the interface, along with a more modular structure and more diagram offering are in the mix. I have been working on some of the enhancements and their implementation in my other lesser known project [TFS Heat ITSM](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSHeatITSM.aspx)…

    [![image](images/TFSStickyBuddyv2.0_7A68-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddyv2.0_7A68-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    As you can see, a new look and feel for a new version, but this should allow me to implement a better modular design and separate out

    the individual bits and pieces.

    Head over to [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com) and vote for your favourite feature, ort add a new one :)

    Until the 30th of November 2008 [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) are increasing the amount of space you get for referring a friend from 256mb to 512mb!

    This is excellent and everyone should have some sort of [backup](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) :) as long as you click my [referral link](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) and use [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG)…

    [http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG "http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG ")

    [![Spread the Word](images/6113670c-3.jpg)](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG)
    { .post-img }

    Really, [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) is a good backup solution and I have been using it for my family and me for a good wee while. In fact, with 2gb for free, if anyone asks me to setup their computer (“No I will not fix yours!”) then I always add it as it makes it way easier to reload from a crash…

    I am currently getting to grips with the Infragistics WPF controls that they call [NetAdvantage for WPF](http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf.aspx). So far I have found them easy to use, but the documentation of examples is very lax. Do not mistake me, these components are fantastic and do way more work for me than I would care to do myself, but if you Google a particular piece of their API invariable you will get pure documentation and no samples. If you are lucky someone has asked a specific question about it and you can skim their answers, but the likely hood of finding an answer to your question is negligible in my experience.

    I still love the components, it just makes it a little more difficult to develop with them…

    An example would maybe get us all on the same page:

    I am using their Ribbon components in one of my applications and wanted to dynamically generate (using a binding) the menu options.

    ```
       1: <igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
       2: 
    ```

    ```
       3:             <igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
       4:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name="uxTeamServerMenuTool" Caption="Team Server" ItemsSource="{Binding AvailableServers}"                                           ItemTemplate="{DynamicResource tAvailableServers}" ButtonType="DropDown"                                           LargeImage="ResourcesImagesTeamServerSelectIcon.png">
    ```

    ```
       5:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>
    ```

    ```
       6:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name="uxTeamProjectMenuTool" Caption="Team Project" ItemsSource="{Binding AvailableProjects}"                                             ButtonType="DropDown" SmallImage="ResourcesImagesTeamProjectSelectIcon.png">
    ```

    ```
       7:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>
    ```

    ```
       8:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name="uxHeatConnectionMenuTool" Caption="Heat Server" ButtonType="DropDown">
    ```

    ```
       9:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>
    ```

    ```
      10:                 <igRibbon:MenuTool x:Name="uxHeatApplicationMenuTool" Caption="Heat App" ButtonType="DropDown" >
    ```

    ```
      11:                 </igRibbon:MenuTool>

      18:                 </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu.FooterToolbar>
    ```

    ```
      19:             </igRibbon:ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    ```
      20:         </igRibbon:XamRibbon.ApplicationMenu>
    ```

    As you can see in line 4 there is a binding that does indeed populate the list. But I am having trouble getting the template to take. I want the Items listed as a set of radio buttons (kinda) and so I added a Template:

    ```
       1: <DataTemplate x:Key="tAvailableServers" DataType="{x:Type tfs:TeamFoundationServer}">
    ```

    ```
       2:            <igRibbon:RadioButtonTool
    ```

    ```
       3:                            Caption="{Binding Name}"
    ```

    ```
       4:                            Tag="{Binding}"
    ```

    ```
       5:                            LargeImage="ResourcesImagesTeamServerSelectIcon.png"
    ```

    ```
       6:                            igRibbon:MenuToolBase.MenuItemDescription="{Binding Url.ToString}"/>
    ```

    ```
       7:        </DataTemplate>
    ```

    This should have displayed what I wanted, but it seams to be ignored.

    To allow this to work, all I needed to do was remove the x:Key from the template. But why can't I specify a template by name. What if I wanted to have two templates and choose which one was displayed…

    I am having a little bit of fun with this application and I though I would share. it logs all of the applications that you are using and gives you stats on it. How about joining the [Microsoft MVP](http://wakoopa.com/teams/MicrosoftMVP) (MVP’s only please) team, or creating your own…

    Here is my usage, which will be exactly the same as the MVP one at the moment as I am the only one there :(

    It is certainly not the fastest site in the world, but my work internet connection is notoriously poor…

    If you have an application, you can get stats for it… for example here is Visual Studio…

    I have been trying to get a handle on doing an automated build of our Business Intelligence solutions and I am always running into problems around the (IMO badly build) BI Packages that are installed via SQL. They do not support Test, they do not support build. There has been no thought given to how people working on them are going to build test and support them and even the project files are not written in the same schema as the rest of the Visual Studio bits. I would have thought, with Team Foundation Server in its third year and second version that this would have been rectified in SQL 2008, but no such luck.

    Today there are enormous BI solutions out there. Some built using these tools, and everyone needs to come up with their own solutions to this problem.

    Here are some of the problems:

    - How do you automate the deployment of SSIS packages?
    - How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of SSIS packages?
    - How do you automate those tests of SSIS packages?
    - How do you automate the deployment of SSAS cubes?
    - How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of SSAS cubes?
    - How do you automate those tests of SSAS cubes?
    - How do you automate the deployment of script packages?
    - How do you Unit test, load test and analyse the performance of script packages?
    - How do you automate those tests of script packages?

    There are some answers. The visual studio team has taken on board the database piece with Visual Studio Team Edition for Databases. But the rest are languishing in perdition and there are no elegant solutions.

    I am bookmarking my investigation on [delicious](http://delicious.com/hinshelm/MSBuild), but it will be a long slog…

    I received a wee email from Kevin Doherty the CEO at [Phase2](http://Phase2.com). These guys host lots of useful things and the had obviously decided to host [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") as part of their offering.

    > _This is a really great site, I regularly send posts to our staff!  You may want to check our site \[www.phase2.com\] for our version of hosted TFS.  We also integrate directly with our MS Project hosted application.  We have our own internal team of developers and offer TFS at a mere fraction of what TFS Now sells it for.  And no contracts.  We would be honoured if you would either review our service or mention us._
    >
    > _**Kevin Doherty**_

    I agreed to review their service, but I would like to point out that I am getting nothing in return :( I am doing this just for fun.

    The guys over at Phase 2 provided me a [TFS server](http://www.phase2.com/hosted_team_foundation_server_overview2.aspx) and I was surprised at both how quickly they came up with it and how fast it was. The worry was that they would be providing a cut down version, like [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com), but it is fully featured and has Reporting Services, Sharepoint and Analytical services. I tested Excel reporting (now Microsoft's recommended method, RS is dead, yippee) and customizing Work items. I also had a few question that the team over at Phase2 answered:

    > Q. You quote 10 users as $1,299.00! Is that per month? (Stupid question I know, but it was not specified on the site.)
    >
    > _A. Yes, this is a per month charge that includes training, support, and backup._
    >
    > Q. What is the backup offering with your service?
    >
    > A. _Standard offering: We back up all client data every night \[incremental\] and full backups once a week.  We store 3 weeks’ worth of full backups. This schedule can be adjusted but additional costs may be involved._
    >
    > Q. Can you provide a multi server package, for example if I had 1000 developers and needed to run SSRS, SSAS, Sharepoint and TFS on multiple servers?
    >
    > A. _Yes, we will provide dedicated services and offer custom bundles.   A standard single-server deployment for TFS is good for about 100 users, beyond which we'd need to move to multiple front-end servers with at least one backend data-tier server.  We are scaling up from blade arrays to very powerful IBM x-series 4- and 6-way servers (all running virtuals, of course) over the next few weeks so we don't yet know what our upper limit is going to be per server.  For a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would certainly apply._
    >
    > Q. What about TFWA, and WIWA?
    >
    > A. _We do support TFWA, but the client must have an account in TFS.  WIWA is something that we can install upon request, but do not by default (For simplicity).  No extra charges for this additional functionality._
    >
    > Q. What is the disaster recovery turnaround?
    >
    > A. _24 hours maximum from time of notification.   Keep in mind that this depends on what the "disaster" is and when it gets noticed.  If the disaster is that someone within a client's organization deleted all or part of a project but no one noticed for 8 weeks,  we could recover the environment in short order but not necessarily the data (see backup comments above.)_
    >
    > Q. Can I bundle TFS with a full environment? TFS + MOSS + Exchange + Communicator?
    >
    > A. _Absolutely, and again, for a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would apply._

    So, a fantastic offering. It should be pointed out that I was using a http connection to the server and not https, but I am sure that it will be available. The costs are very reasonable and a lot better than [TFS Now](http://www.tfsnow.com/), which I was going to compare to, but alas their site is down at the time of writing.

    [![image](images/WherehasMartinbeen_C9BB-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-WherehasMartinbeen_C9BB-image_2.png)I know that I have not been posting in a while, and I hope to remedy that. I have been working on getting our internal team up to speed on using [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") as a full ALM tool and not just for source control. I am getting a lot of resistance on creating work items ( as this is a PM’s job !) but we are making progress.
    { .post-img }

    I was off for the last couple of days and came back to a WTF moment. I noticed, upon opening my source control, that there were two “Main” folders. “Main” and “MainPreR1”.

    WTF?

    Upon enquiring it turns out that a change had been made to “R1” (legitimate) to fix a Bug (loose definition, but a definition none the less). Then the “Main” folder had been renamed and a new “Main” folder branched from “R1” and 2 new Features branched from that, leaving all the other existing branches to fend for themselves.

    WTFx2!

    If you are not sure what I mean, then let me explain. In order to merge from “F1207” into “Main” you would need to first merge it with “MainPreR1”, then merge it with “R1”, then merge it into “Main”. And thus you have just contaminated “R1” with something that is not in “R1” but should be in “R2”. On top of this the other orphaned features can’t take advantage of new features in “R2” without contaminating “R1”… messy.

    As you can see from the screenshot on the right it is now under control, but it took the perpetrator the better part of the morning to get it sorted, and the are still putting the finishing touches to it (It is a good thing the do not let us have guns here in the UK). If you are interested, here are the steps that were performed to sort out this problem.

    1. **Zip all content in  “Fxx1” and “Fxx2”.** _To safeguard the dev work._
    2. **Delete branch “Fxx1” and “Fxx2” from source control**
    3. **Check in everything…**
    4. **Delete “Main” from source control.** _coz it is the crap one_
    5. **Check in everything**
    6. **Rename “MainPreR1” to “Main”.** _Which is the way it should have been._
    7. **Check In Everything…** _Now we are back where we started._
    8. **Merge “R1” into “Main”.** _This is the action that should have occurred in the first place._
    9. **Check in everything…**
    10. **Create Branches for “Fxx1” and “Fxx1”**
    11. **Check in everything…**
    12. **Check out “Fxx1” and “Fxx1”.**
    13. **Copy archived “Fxx1” and “Fxx2” over the top of new branch.**
    14. **Check in everything…**

    A long way for a short cut :)

    Well, at least the lesson is learned…

    If you want to be able to use workflow on you're my site that will allow you to assign tasks to your colleagues, then you need to take a couple of thing into consideration. The most important is to give any users assigned tasks access to the tasks list that you are using for your workflow.

    You will need to think hard about wither the workflow you are considering would be better as part of your team's site, or as part of another site in the Sharepoint farm as adding permission to other people on your MySite is a security risk. But the benefit may well be worth the risk.

    What we will be doing is adding any users you will be assigning workflow to the "Contributors" group so they will be able to delete tasks.

    When you setup your workflow you will be asked what task list you want to use for it. If you selected "New Task List" the system will create a task list of the name "\[Workflow Name\] Tasks".

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_13-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_28.png)
    { .post-img }

    You will need to give users permission to this Task list, but you could have multiple task lists to allow more refined permission for different workflows.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_12-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_26.png)
    { .post-img }

    ## Finding the task list name

    First you need to find the Task list. If you have already setup the workflow, the changes are that you have used the default, which is "Tasks". You can check by going to the list or document library that has the workflow and click the "Settings" tab and then the "Manage" option.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_11-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_24.png)
    { .post-img }

    You will then be presented with all of the options for your list or library. The option you are looking for is the "Workflow Settings" option under "Permissions and Management".

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_10-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_22.png)
    { .post-img }

    This will take you to a list of all of the workflows that are currently setup (or the create workflow page if there are none) where you need to select the workflow that you want.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_9-13-13.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_20.png)
    { .post-img }

    This will take you to the change a workflow page and you will be able to see the name of the task list, in this case "Example Workflow Tasks".

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_8-12-12.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_18.png)
    { .post-img }

    Now we have that information we need to return to the top level of your MySite to set the permissions on your Task List.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_7-11-11.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_16.png)
    { .post-img }

    ## Setting the permissions on a Task list

    Now we know the name of the task list we can set the permission on the correct list. Click on the "View All Site Content" button to see a list of all the bits and bobs that have already been created.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_6-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_14.png)
    { .post-img }

    Under the "Lists" Heading you will see the "Example Workflow Tasks" list which is not displayed by default on the left navigation of your MySite homepage. If you click the name you will be taken directly to the list so we can edit the permissions.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_5-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    As before we will need to get to the lists options, so click the "List Settings".

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_4-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    And again under "Permissions and Management" select "Permissions for this list".

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_3-7-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    By default all lists created use the same permissions as the parent site. We need to override this so we can set specific permission for our workflow tasks. To enable specific permissions we click the "Edit Permissions" button which makes a copy of the existing permissions and detached the list's permission from your MySite. You will get a warning box to make you aware of this and that any changes to the top level site will no longer affect the permissions of this list.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_2-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    You now have the option to delete, edit and add users to **_this list only_** as you would on any site. Add the users who you will be assigning workflow tasks to and delete any others that you do not want access.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Make sure that you have the correct users listed in the "Users/Groups" box and that you only have the "Contribute" permission enabled. Then decide wither to send people an email to let them know that they now have access.

    [![image](images/HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_thumb-14-14.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToAllowotheruserstointeractwithworkfl_D4EB-image_2.png)

    I thought I should explain how to enable the "My Calendar" web part on you're my Site (homepage). Here is my "MySite", as you can see I have a horrible picture, but if you check out the red rectangle you will see the "My Calendar" control has already been added to your site.

    [![image](images/HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_thumb_4-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    To configure this and any other web parts you need to hit the little down arrow below and then select "Modify Shared Web Part" to enter edit mode for that web part.

    [![image](images/HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_thumb_3-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    Your page will now be in edit mode denoted by the "Exit Edit Mode" button that appears under the "Site Actions" navigation and the addition of the "Add a web part" and Zone boxes that appears. To configure the "My Calendar" web part you will see the panel on the right has the same heading as the web part that we just opted to modify. You should now see the "Mail Configuration" section with a blank box under "Mail server address" and your email filled out under "Mailbox". To enable the calendar you need to put in the address of the Outlook Web Access server. This is "http://\[servername\]/exchange".

    [![image](images/HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_6.png) [![image](images/HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Once you have filled out the "Mail server address" you need to click "Apply" at the bottom of the page to make the change.

    [![image](images/HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_thumb-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HowToDisplayyourOutlookcalendaronyoureMy_D93C-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Your calendar items will now be displayed on the page.

    You can add other Outlook Web Access features to your page including "My Contacts" or "My Tasks" and the much more useful "My Email" which can all be configured in the same way.

    I recently found the need to Sync two lists. I have one list that is used for display, and I want to dynamically sync that list with a new one by applying a delta.

    I thought that this would be difficult, but I was surprised at its ease.

    ```
       1: 
    ```

    ```
       2: Module SyncExtensions
    ```

    ```
       3: 
    ```

    ```
       4:     <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _
    ```

    ```
       5:     Public Sub Sync(Of TItem)(ByVal targetItems As ICollection(Of TItem), ByVal sourceItems As IEnumerable(Of TItem))
    ```

    ```
       6:         Dim o As Object = DirectCast(targetItems, ICollection).SyncRoot
    ```

    ```
       7:         If Monitor.TryEnter(o, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)) Then
    ```

    ```
       8:             ' Find items in source that are not in target
    ```

    ```
       9:             Dim itemsToAdd As New Collection(Of TItem)
    ```

    ```
      10:             For Each Item In sourceItems
    ```

    ```
      11:                 If Not targetItems.Contains(Item) Then
    ```

    ```
      12:                     itemsToAdd.Add(Item)
    ```

    ```
      13:                 End If
    ```

    ```
      14:             Next
    ```

    ```
      15:             ' Apply all adds
    ```

    ```
      16:             For Each Item In itemsToAdd
    ```

    ```
      17:                 targetItems.Add(Item)
    ```

    ```
      18:             Next
    ```

    ```
      19:             ' Find tags in target that should not be in source
    ```

    ```
      20:             Dim itemsToRemove As New Collection(Of TItem)
    ```

    ```
      21:             For Each Item In targetItems
    ```

    ```
      22:                 If Not sourceItems.Contains(Item) Then
    ```

    ```
      23:                     itemsToRemove.Add(Item)
    ```

    ```
      24:                 End If
    ```

    ```
      25:             Next
    ```

    ```
      26:             ' Apply all removes
    ```

    ```
      27:             For Each Item In itemsToRemove
    ```

    ```
      28:                 targetItems.Remove(Item)
    ```

    ```
      29:             Next
    ```

    ```
      30:             ' Dispose Timer
    ```

    ```
      31:             Monitor.Exit(o)
    ```

    ```
      32:         End If
    ```

    ```
      33:     End Sub
    ```

    ```
      34: 
    ```

    ```
      35: End Module
    ```

    You need to remember to lock the object while you sync. This is to allow your threading to take place without incident. The nitty gritty is just a case of comparing the two lists and building a list of changes to make and then removing them :)

    I have a little custom control I need added to my [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") projects. This control will allow specific groups of users as representatives of Advocacy groups with in the life cycle model to sign off a Requirement or Change Request from within Visual Studio.

    But, just to make things a little more fun, I wanted to create the custom work item tracking control using WPF.

    In order to do this you need a wrapper control that allows you to load any WPF control that inherits from IWorkItemControl.

    Here is an example WPF Work Item Control:

    \[[Get SignOffControl.xaml.vb source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35593&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\]

    It does not yet do anything, but the base wrapper is there. The visual elements only contain a couple of button to get me started testing the wapper and to make sure that the control is displayed:

    \[[Get SignOffControl.xaml source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35594&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\]

    ```
       1: <UserControl x:Class="SignOff.SignOffControl"
    ```

    ```
       2:     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    ```

    ```
       3:     xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" Width="317" Height="46">
    ```

    ```
       4:     <StackPanel>
    ```

    ```
       5:         <Button>SignOff</Button>
    ```

    ```
       6:         <Button>Clear</Button>
    ```

    ```
       7:     </StackPanel>
    ```

    ```
       8: </UserControl>
    ```

    This will display 2 buttons, but does nothing.

    You then need to create your wrapper control. This is a forms control that has the Element Host forms control to host the button. I have gone down the generic rout to minimise the amount of code I would use to create an individual “stub” when creating multiple controls.

    here is an example “stub” which is created as a simple class:

    \[[Get SignOffHostControl.vb source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35595&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\]

    ```
       1: Namespace SignOff
    ```

    ```
       2: 
    ```

    ```
       3:     Public Class SignOffHostControl
    ```

    ```
       4:         Inherits WitCustomControlBase(Of SignOffControl)
    ```

    ```
       5: 
    ```

    ```
       6:     End Class
    ```

    ```
       7: 
    ```

    ```
       8: End Namespace
    ```

    > _note: although this inherits from user control you will not be able to view it in the designer because of the generic nature of its inheritance. This is OK and does not hamper development._

    All the heavy lifting for this control is done in the WitCustomControlBase and the generic type passed needs to meet the requirements of New, UIElement and IWorkItemControl. This ensures that it is a WPF control that inherits from IWorkItemControl.

    To create this control you need to create a new Windows Forms control and call it WitCustomControlBase. Add a WPF “Element Host” to it and make that host dock to the total area.

    Then we need to make the designer generic.

    As you can see the only changes that have been made are to the class to add the generic type (line 5) and to the type used on the control instance (lines 29, 53).

    Now we have changed the designer, we need to move on to the main control code and change it to pass all calls and implementation of the IWorkItemControl interface to the WPF control.

    This control implements the IWorkItemControl and it is the control that Work Item Tracking loads. Work Item Tracking form display module does not know anything about WPF and we are just faking up the interface to allow us to use the full functionality on WPF in place of Windows Forms. We can use the same method to implement the other features like IWorkItemUserAction.

    We then need a Work Item Custom Control (WICC) definition file.

    \[[Get SignOffControl.wicc source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=35596&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fTFSWitWpfControls&changeSetId=1459)\] \[[Get latest full source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSWitWpfControls/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx)\]

    ```
       1: <?xml version="1.0"?>
    ```

    ```
       2: <CustomControl xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    ```

    ```
       3:  <Assembly>Hinshelwood.WitCustomControls.dll</Assembly>
    ```

    ```
       4:  <FullClassName>Hinshelwood.WitCustomControls.SignOff.SignOffHostControl</FullClassName>
    ```

    ```
       5: </CustomControl>
    ```

    This is the file that tells Visual Studio what to do.

    This file and the .dll need to copied to the …Application DataMicrosoftTeam FoundationWork Item TrackingCustom Controls9.0 folder.

    We can now add this control to a work item by modifying the XML definition of a Work item. To test I have just replaced an existing control.

    You can add this using the Power Tools process template editor.

    { .post-img }

    The result?

    { .post-img }

    You will notice that this control is marked as read-only, but not bad for a first pass…

    With the new Windows Live Wave 3 betas now available I am looking forward to many of the features I have already previewed in the beta of Windows Live Messenger 9.

    These are the English installs, but [other languages are available](http://www.liveside.net/main/archive/2008/09/16/windows-live-wave-3-betas-download-now.aspx).

    Web or partial install:

    [http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-web.exe](http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-web.exe)

    Full local install(recommended if you are behind a firewall):  
    [http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-all.exe](http://g.live.com/1rebeta3/en/wlsetup-all.exe)

    I am only really interested in Messenger and Writer, but all the

    application are there.

    It seams as if they went well! The plan of under preparing and over delivering worked a treat... Because I know the topics the lack of a prepared script allowed me to concentrate more on emparting knowlage and less on keeping to a set of arbitrary notes the go to pot as soon as the first question is asked.

    Yes the presentations were a little disjointed, but the content was delivered without too much hesitation and none of the stage fright that mared my last presentation at MS... even with a laptop that had a mind of its own and kept backing through the slides as if it did not want me to go on...

    It helped that the Developer Platform guys are a lot less scary than the Application Developer Consultants ;)

    **What's this "Developer TS VSTS" thing anyway?**

    Well, it has a lot more sales focus that I thought it did! This is not a bad thing, but I thought that there would be some development and problem solving in there, but it is more of a pre-sales technology consultancy role... I think that this could be a good move for me, and definatly suits my personality, but I would really miss the development...

    We will see, I should here by early next week...

    As I am traveling today and I am not taking a laptop, I want to be able to do a little personal work from my mobile..

    What I would realy like is to be able to monitor and edit my [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") (Team Foundation Server) work items from my phone! And I am not talking about some crappy web based solution, I hate not being able to work offline, but a Smart Client application like the one I am using now (Diarist 2) that can let me work away with cached work items and then sync later!

    If only the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") API, excellent though it is, could be used without the need for Team Explorer to be installed.

    I am doing a presentation this afternoon on Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). This is the first time that I have ever presented on this topic, and I found out that I was doing it on Friday!

    I have put together a bunch of slides pulling information mostly from Wikipedia. I have another presentation afterwards on Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), but it is the ALM one that scares me. I already had canned slides for [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System"), but ALM is something that I have really only begun to get a handle on. I know enough to know that I do not really know anything at all :)

    So why am I doing it?

    Well, if you are involved with [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") in the UK you will probably know, or have heard of Neil Kidd. He is the current UK "Developer TS [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System")" at Microsoft. I have delt with him both at events and in the context of work, and I have found him knowledgeable, helpful and patient, even when I ask stupid questions.

    I had heard that he was moving to another area within Microsoft (I think something to do with the TFS Rangers), but I was surprised when one of the guys (thanks Jon) I have delt with at Microsoft over the years gave me a call and asked if I would be interested in the "Developer TS [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System")" position... Wow, an internal recomenation...

    So here I am, on an easyjet flight on my way to London.

    And I now return to the topic of this post, I do waffle so...

    The reason the ALM presentation is making me anxious is quite apart from my fledgling knowlage on the subject, my slides are terrible! No really... They are so bad even I have trouble following them, or even coming up with a story behind them.

    I am going to have to use my slides as vague pointers and try to create a presentation on the fly...bad I know, but it is the best decision out of a bad bunch. I have an hour interview before the presentation so maybe I can do some limiting of the expectations. The second presentation on [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") should go a little better...I hope...

    If you are going for an interview at Microsoft make sure you lock yourself away for however amount of preperation time you need, with no distractions! That means no Tv, Xbox, children, wifes, family events of any kind. Preferably you should go to a cabin in the mountins with only your internet connection to keep you company... ;) Wish me luck....

    I think that it would be good to remove the drop down to select your blog from the main blog writing page.

    I tapped it by mistake when I was trying to select a piece of text and lost my whole post...

    Only 10 minutes of time, but an entire train of thought!

    I received a confusing error from MS Build on Friday. I assumed that it was a GDR version issue for the top level message:

    [![image](images/TeamBuildError_7CDD-image_thumb-2-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamBuildError_7CDD-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Now, we have the situation with our Business Intelligence  system where we have 2 solutions. One for Visual Studio 2005 projects that consist solely of the Business Intelligence Package bits, and a 2008 solution which consists of everything else that is needed to build our solution. We do plan to move everything over to 2008, but we are currently targeting SQL Server 2005.

    The problem looks like it is to do with the 2008 solution an not the 2005 one:

    [![image](images/TeamBuildError_7CDD-image_thumb_1-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TeamBuildError_7CDD-image_4.png) 
    { .post-img }

    But, the error message implies that it is the 2005 solution:

    After reading up, I am none the wiser, but I did find information that implied that installing SP1 for [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") should fix the problem and not require that I update the TFS server. We are using GDR bits, so I will be installing GDR 16 and the SQL Server 2008 Business  Intelligence bits.

    **UPDATE: So after jut updating the GDR, I got the solution to build! Not sure why there was an error in the 2005 solution!**

    Well we have been having a few problems with the [GDR](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/20/vstsdb-2008-gdr-ctp16-is-here.aspx). Essentially when we import our database it complains about dependencies.

    We have many stored procedures that call stored procedures that call stored procedures! This seams to give the GDR fits. Maybe we are doing something that we are not supposed to, but SQL does not complain.

    I tried uninstalling the GDR, but that left me with NO data dude :(

    SO I have reinstalled and will try again....

    This is not isolated to GDR, but seams to exist in Data Dude as well. If you create the following SQL:

    ```
       1: CREATE VIEW [dbo].[v_SomeView] AS
    ```

    ```
       2: SELECT    [BH].[Col1],
    ```

    ```
       3:         [BH].[Col2],
    ```

    ```
       4:         [BH].[Col3],
    ```

    ```
       5:         [BH].[Col4],
    ```

    ```
       6:         [BH].[Col5],
    ```

    ```
       7:         CASE WHEN [BHPP].[OtherCol1] IS NULL THEN -1 ELSE 1 END As [Col6],
    ```

    ```
       8:         CASE WHEN [BHPP].[OtherCol1] IS NULL THEN 'Not Applicable' ELSE 'PowerPack' END As [Col7],
    ```

    ```
       9:         CASE WHEN [BHPP].[OtherCol1] IS NULL THEN [BH].[Col5] ELSE [BHPP].[OtherCol2] END As [Col8]
    ```

    ```
      10: FROM    [dbo].[Table1] as [BH]
    ```

    ```
      11:         LEFT JOIN     (SELECT [OtherCol1], [OtherCol2], [OtherCol3]
    ```

    ```
      12:                     FROM    [$(CMD)].[dbo].[Table2]
    ```

    ```
      13:                     WHERE    [OtherCol1] <> -1) as [BHPP]
    ```

    ```
      14:             ON [BH].[Col2] = [BHPP].[Col2]
    ```

    And add it to your Database project, but using proper table names :) You will get the following error for every use of \[BHPP\]:

    > Error    13    SR0029 : Microsoft.Validation : View: \[dbo\].\[v_SomeView\] contains an unresolved reference to an object. Either the object does not exist or the reference is ambiguous because it could refer to any of the following objects:....

    This is a show stopper for us as we can't (without good cause) be creating more views just to do a derived table...

    The Sticky Buddy has been updated to fix the following problems:

    This means that if you run [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) from now you should get v1.6.

    I don't as our Proxy is a bit crap and does not detect the changes in .application files for a few days :(

    Absolutely brilliant. That's what I think of Linq to XSD. Disappointed that is only works in C#, but having to use C# for a single project out of a solution it is a small price to pay to get the functionality.

    If you install the [_LINQ to XSD Preview_ Alpha 0.2 Refresh](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=A45F58CD-FCFC-439E-B735-8182775560AF&displaylang=en) you get a couple of extra project definitions:

    [![image](images/LINQtoXSD_D04A-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-LINQtoXSD_D04A-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you create one of these it will have the features enabled. You can add the features to an existing project by editing the project definition file to add a property group:

    ```
       1: <PropertyGroup>
    ```

    ```
       2:   <TXLINQBinDir Condition="'$(TXLINQBinDir)' == ''">$(ProgramFiles)LINQ to XSD PreviewBin</TXLINQBinDir>
    ```

    ```
       3: </PropertyGroup>
    ```

    And an import reference:

    ```
       1: <Import Project="$(TXLINQBinDir)LinqToXsd.targets" />
    ```

    note: if you are using MSBuild or Team Build you will need to install this add on there as well....

    Now that you have a project, when you add an XSD you will have extra Build Actions available. Once you have set all of your XSD files to this Action and build, you will have classes for all of your XSD's. On down side is that it created a single file ("/obj/debug/LinqToXsdSource.cs"), bit it does work.

    It may be simple, and it may be small, but the feature that hit me first and greatest in IE8 was the address bar enhancements. This feature alone would have me upgrading:

    If you were worried about your pages viewing correctly in IE8 Beta 1 you had to restart your browser to enable "IE7 Compatibility mode". Now it is easy:

    [![image](images/CompatibilityviewinIE8_D4D1-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CompatibilityviewinIE8_D4D1-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Although it seams to do a bit of detecting and only displays it on certain sites.

    For example Microsoft.com and Google.com do not get the little button.

    But Gmail does :)

    I was having a problem getting multi threading working with the ObservableCollection, and struggled to find a solution. So I asked my friend Google and after a while it directed me to [Kevin's](http://blog.quantumbitdesigns.com/) blog and specifically to his post on [WPF Cross-Thread Collection Binding - Part 4 - The Grand Solution](http://blog.quantumbitdesigns.com/2008/07/22/wpf-cross-thread-collection-binding-part-4-the-grand-solution/).

    This is a fantastic article, that provided me with the exact solution I was looking for, so I perused his other articles and found many tips on Multi-Threading....

    One to watch...

    Calling a method on an instance of an object in WPF is not as easy to figure out, but with the help of this Internet thing I managed it.

    Say you have a DataTemplate that renders a WorkItemType as a button that is selectable:

    ```
       1: <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type tfswitc:WorkItemType}">
    ```

    ```
       2:     <DockPanel>
    ```

    ```
       3:         <Image DockPanel.Dock="Left"
    ```

    ```
       4:                x:Name="wiImage"
    ```

    ```
       5:                Width="16"
    ```

    ```
       6:                Height="16"
    ```

    ```
       7:                Source="pack://application:,,/Resources/Images/WorkItems/unknown.gif">
    ```

    ```
       8:         </Image>
    ```

    ```
       9:         <Button x:Name="wiButton"
    ```

    ```
      10:                 Content="{Binding Name}"
    ```

    ```
      11:                 Style="{DynamicResource WelcomeButtonStyle}"
    ```

    ```
      12:                 CommandParameter="{Binding}"
    ```

    ```
      13:                 Command="Controlers:TeamSystemCommands.ChangeWorkItemTypeCommand">
    ```

    ```
      14:         </Button>
    ```

    ```
      15:     </DockPanel>
    ```

    ```
      16: </DataTemplate>
    ```

    Now, if I wanted to call a method on an instance of that WorkItemType and perform some action, then I would need a DataTrigger:

    ```
       1: <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type tfswitc:WorkItemType}">
    ```

    ```
       2:     <DockPanel>
    ```

    ```
       3:         <Image DockPanel.Dock="Left"
    ```

    ```
       4:                x:Name="wiImage"
    ```

    ```
       5:                Width="16"
    ```

    ```
       6:                Height="16"
    ```

    ```
       7:                Source="pack://application:,,/Resources/Images/WorkItems/unknown.gif">
    ```

    ```
       8:         </Image>
    ```

    ```
       9:         <Button x:Name="wiButton"
    ```

    ```
      10:                 Content="{Binding Name}"
    ```

    ```
      11:                 Style="{DynamicResource WelcomeButtonStyle}"
    ```

    ```
      12:                 CommandParameter="{Binding}"
    ```

    ```
      13:                 Command="Controlers:TeamSystemCommands.ChangeWorkItemTypeCommand">
    ```

    ```
      14:         </Button>
    ```

    ```
      15:     </DockPanel>
    ```

    ```
      16:     <DataTemplate.Triggers>
    ```

    ```
      17:         <DataTrigger Value="False">
    ```

    ```
      18:             <DataTrigger.Binding>
    ```

    ```
      19:                 <Binding>
    ```

    ```
      20:                     <Binding.Source>
    ```

    ```
      21:                         <ObjectDataProvider ObjectType="{x:Type tfswitc:WorkItemType}"
    ```

    ```
      22:                                             MethodName="SupportedByHeat" />
    ```

    ```
      23:                     </Binding.Source>
    ```

    ```
      24:                 </Binding>
    ```

    ```
      25:             </DataTrigger.Binding>
    ```

    ```
      26:             <Setter TargetName="wiButton"
    ```

    ```
      27:                     Property="IsEnabled"
    ```

    ```
      28:                     Value="False" />
    ```

    ```
      29:             <Setter TargetName="wiButton"
    ```

    ```
      30:                     Property="ToolTip"
    ```

    ```
      31:                     Value="You will need to add the 'HeatITSM.Ref' field to use this work item." />
    ```

    ```
      32:         </DataTrigger>
    ```

    ```
      33:     </DataTemplate.Triggers>
    ```

    ```
      34: </DataTemplate>
    ```

    This will Call the method and if it returns false, it will disable the button and set a tooltip.

    Now, this should work, but my SupportedByHeat method is an Extension method defined as:

    ```
       1: Imports Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client
    ```

    ```
       2: 
    ```

    ```
       3: Namespace TeamFoundationExtensions
    ```

    ```
       4: 
    ```

    ```
       5: 
    ```

    ```
       6:     Module WorkItemTypeExtensions
    ```

    ```
       7: 
    ```

    ```
       8:         <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _
    ```

    ```
       9:       Public Function SupportedByHeat(ByVal wit As WorkItemType) As Boolean
    ```

    ```
      10:             Dim c As Controlers.TeamSystemControler(Of MainWindow)
    ```

    ```
      11:             c = Application.ControlerFactory.GetControler(Of Controlers.TeamSystemControler(Of MainWindow))()
    ```

    ```
      12:             Return c.CheckWorkItemField(wit)
    ```

    ```
      13:         End Function
    ```

    ```
      14: 
    ```

    ```
      15:     End Module
    ```

    ```
      16: 
    ```

    ```
      17: End Namespace
    ```

    And this does not seam to work even if I import the namespace in the XAML:

    ```
       1: <UserControl x:Class="SelectWorkItemType"
    ```

    ```
       2:   xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    ```

    ```
       3:   xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    ```

    ```
       4:   xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2006"
    ```

    ```
       5:   xmlns:tfs="clr-namespace:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client;assembly=Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client"
    ```

    ```
       6:   xmlns:tfswitc="clr-namespace:Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client;assembly=Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client"
    ```

    ```
       7:   xmlns:tfse="clr-namespace:Hinshelwood.TFSHeatITSM.TeamFoundationExtensions"
    ```

    ```
       8:   xmlns:local="clr-namespace:Hinshelwood.TFSHeatITSM"
    ```

    ```
       9:   xmlns:Controlers="clr-namespace:Hinshelwood.TFSHeatITSM.Controlers"
    ```

    ```
      10:   xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
    ```

    ```
      11:   mc:Ignorable="d">
    ```

    The error message that is received is:

    > _System.Windows.Data Error: 34 : ObjectDataProvider: Failure trying to invoke method on type; Method='SupportedByHeat'; Type='WorkItemType'; Error='No method was found with matching parameter signature.' MissingMethodException:'System.MissingMethodException: Method 'Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.WorkItemType.SupportedByHeat' not found.  
    >    at System.RuntimeType.InvokeMember(String name, BindingFlags bindingFlags, Binder binder, Object target, Object\[\] providedArgs, ParameterModifier\[\] modifiers, CultureInfo culture, String\[\] namedParams)_
    >

    >
    > at System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider.InvokeMethodOnInstance(Exception& e)'\_

    As you can see, during the binding the extension method is not evaluated.

    During my investigation I came across [WPFix Part 3 (Extension Methods)](http://www.fikrimvar.net/lestirelim/?p=23) that intoned that there is indeed some solution, but it is complicated requiring the use of Lambda expressions.

    I am looking for an easy solution :)

We need some way of moving and syncing items between these two systems.
    { .post-img }

    [![TFS Heat ITSM start screen](images/HeatITSM_78C9-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HeatITSM_78C9-image_2.png) I completed the first part by using my [TFS Event Handler](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSEventHandler.aspx) project and that piece is live. If you put a field on any work item called "HeatITSM.Ref" and you fill it out (manually) with an ID from Heat then every time you change the work item it will update heat with a "Note" attached to that "Call". This was very easy using the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler model, but it still means that you need to create the Work Item manually.
    { .post-img }

    The next step is to create a [TFS Heat ITSM](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSHeatITSM.aspx) application that loads all the calls for a specific "Application" (category) and allows you to create a Work Item with a single click.

    [![TFS Heat ITSM Work Item creation screen](images/HeatITSM_78C9-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-HeatITSM_78C9-image_4.png) Well, I have been working on it, and the [Codeplex](http://codeplex.com) site is up, and a initial Alfa application is there, but I an doing a refactor at the moment as things were getting a little complicated and confusing on the code side so a simplification was required.
    { .post-img }

    As you can see from the screen shots I am using the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://hinshelwood.com/TFSStickyBuddy.aspx) base code as a starting point and working from there, although during the refactor I am making a lot of changes that will benefit Sticky Buddy v2.0 as well.

    Well, Back to the code face :)

    I have a little problem...I don't have a computer at home at the moment :( So I am writing this post from my Pocket PC using Diarist 2. I will come back to that, but first...

    The reason for my lack of my "can't live without accesory" is that my laptop has finaly given up the ghost. It is an 8 year old Dell desktop replacemnt, and in my infinite wisdom I desided to install Vista just after it went RTM. All was well for a while, but it was a litle slow. Add Visual Studio 2005 and things got a little slower...

    It took aroung 3 months to sucessfuly get SP1 installed, yes I was one of those unfortinate users that had problems, and my laptop has never been the same since. For example, uninstalling VS2008 Beta and moving to the RTM took near enough 74 hours...Not good...

    Well, it worked for a month and then started blue screening. Could be anything, but when I bit the bullet last night and desided to go back to XP I kept getting errors reading the disk which could on reflection be the disk, but I have a feeling that the hardware is toast...

    So here I am writing this post on my phone and its not such a bad experience, although I have found that many sites talking about mobile software and devices don't actualy support viewing on a mobile device! What is that about...

    I needed to look for some software to write this post, and obviously I found it, but it did require me to use most of the bits that an average person uses on a computer.  
    \- Searching the internet  
    \- Loading and reading web pages  
    \- Downloading and instaling software  
    \- Writing documents

    On top of this, although I have never used it, I have a cut down version of Office 2007.

    Taking allof this into acount I have found it a relatively painless experience, but I do accnowlage that I am not an average user and a terrible speller...

    Now all I need is a version of Visual Studio 2008 and Team Explorer ;)

    If you have Visual Studio 2008 SP1 Beta installed make sure that you run the [Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack Preparation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A494B0E0-EB07-4FF1-A21C-A4663E456D9D&displaylang=en) prior to the installation, Microsoft were trying to make this a [seamless process](http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2008/05/14/the-release-of-visual-studio-2008-sp1-will-install-over-sp1-beta.aspx), but on [Heath Stewart's Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/default.aspx) he mentions that this was [not possible in the end](http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2008/08/11/vs-2008-sp1-beta-must-be-removed-prior-to-installing-the-release-of-vs-2008-sp1.aspx). The Preparation tool takes a while to run, but it is way better than having to uninstall everything :)

    You will need your Visual Studio 2008 Install files when running the Preparation tool, but you should always keep the ISO handy any how…

    A pure .NET 3.5 SP1 Betas install however (like out web servers) can just be updated by running the [SP1 RTM install](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7&displaylang=en).

    I received the following error box after installing VS2008 SP1 RTM:

    [![image](images/ProblemswithTeamExplorerafterinstalledVi_E82C-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ProblemswithTeamExplorerafterinstalledVi_E82C-image_2.png)

    > Team Foundation Error

    This stopped me accessing version control…a key part if you ask me.

    The first thing I tried was to “Repair” Team Explorer, but that did not help, so I had a wee google…and found:

    [Problem of Team Explorer after installed Visual Studio 2008 SP1 beta](http://dotnet.robertmao.com/2008/05/27/problem-of-team-explorer-after-installed-visual-studio-2008-sp1-beta/) which lead me to [Re: Bug after installer the SP1 with work items](http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3380330&SiteID=1) and thus to the old favourite “reinstall the service pack!”

    I have opened a thread ([Problems with Team Explorer after installed Visual Studio 2008 SP1 RTM](http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3736501&SiteID=1)) on the MSDN forums…

    If the reinstall of the SP fixes my problem, I will update there…

    **Update 2008-08-14: Nope, no fixie... I have sent my workstation to helpdesk for a rebuild. Humph!**

    **Update 2008-08-15: I have installed SP1 sucessfully on 3 other computers.... Even ones that already had SP1 Beta1... Must just have been my workstation... double humph!**

    Well, MSDN will be busy today… Visual Studio 2008 Beta 1, Team Foundation Server 2008 Beta 1 and .NET Framework Beta 1 have all been released today. This is grate news as I have been using the Beta for about as long as it has been available and all those applications I have waiting in the wings can now go live :), Or at least get into the final phase of development.

    Can you imaging a better data capture application than one that builds itself ([**ASP.NET Dynamic Data**](http://www.asp.net/dynamicdata/)) or even a web service to expose your database to an application that you just tell it which bits of data you want to use ([**ADO.NET Data Services**](http://www.asp.net/learn/3.5-SP1/video-239.aspx)). How about the ability to create a conceptual model of your data from multiple databases that hides your application from database schema changes ([**ADO.NET Entity Framework**](http://www.asp.net/learn/3.5-SP1/video-245.aspx)). That's just in the [ASP.NET and ADO](http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-SP1/default.aspx) bags, not to mention the WPF performance improvements and the ClickOnce improved install process as well as being able to customise said process and the ability to deploy application with a cut down version of the .NET Framework that has a smaller footprint (20mb as opposed to 60mb) and have the full framework streamed down over time with BITS.

    The .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1 has improvements and optimisation's across the board…A good day for developers and users alike.

    There are tones of performance and minor [improvements in Team Foundation Server](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/04/28/team-foundation-server-2008-sp1.aspx) as well…

    A while a go I create a [Service Manager](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/articles/Creating-a-managed-service-factory-Article.aspx). A way of wrapping local and remote services (widgets, bits, things) for use in any application within your business or just in your own code…

    I made the source available before, but as I am now going to be using and updating it again, I have created a [Codeplex Project](http://codeplex.com/ServiceManager) for it and put it up on [my own site](http://hinshelwood.com/ServiceManager.aspx) and called it [.NET Service Manager](http://hinshelwood.com/ServiceManager.aspx).

    You can download the source code, and in a very short while I will have a first release up…

    It is quite simple, but has a plethora of uses… One of the best is creating Client side API’s for web services and components of applications…

    As you have probably noticed I have moved URL’s (sorry to all you feed readers with the duplicate entries). The reason I moved my blog was to free up the [http://hinshelwood.com](http://hinshelwood.com) URL for use as a personal site that then links to my blog. When you do this you need to consider all of your current users, bookmarks, feeds, links and all that malarkey.

    So, I created a WebRedirect (thanks to DynDNS.org) that means that all hinshelwood.com traffic is automatically redirected to blog.hinshelwood.com including all of the sub pages. This is fine until I actually put up a site on hinshelwood.com and brake all of the links… HttpHandler to the rescue…

    The first step was to create a “BlogRedirectHandler” to redirect all of those pesky URL’s to the new site.

    ```
    Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions
    Imports System.Web

    Namespace Core.Handlers

        Public Class BlogRedirectHandler
            Implements IHttpHandler

            Private Shared m_Patterns() As String = {"/archive/*", _
                                                     "/Tag/*/default.aspx", _
                                                     "/category/*"}

            Public Shared Function IsValidToRun(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext, _
                                                ByVal requestType As String, _
                                                ByVal virtualPath As String, _
                                                ByVal path As String) As Boolean
                For Each p In m_Patterns
                    If Regex.IsMatch(context.Request.Url.ToString, p) Then Return True
                Next
                Return False
            End Function

            Public ReadOnly Property IsReusable() As Boolean Implements IHttpHandler.IsReusable
                Get
                    Return True
                End Get
            End Property

            Public Sub ProcessRequest(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext) Implements IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest
                Dim oldurl As String = context.Request.Url.ToString
                If oldurl.Contains("/archive/") Then
                    Dim newurl As String = "http://blog.hinshelwood.com" & context.Request.Url.AbsolutePath
                    context.Response.StatusCode = System.Net.HttpStatusCode.MovedPermanently ' permanent HTTP 301
                    context.Response.RedirectLocation = newurl
                    context.Response.StatusDescription = "Moved Permanently"
                    context.Response.ContentType = "text/html"
                    context.Response.Write("<html><head><title>Object Moved</title></head><body>")
                    context.Response.Write("<h2>Object moved to <a href=" & newurl & " >here</a>.</h2>")
                    context.Response.Write("</body></html>")
                    context.Response.End()
                End If

            End Sub

        End Class

    End Namespace
    ```

    This little piece of code has two important pieces, the “IsValidToRun” which makes sure that we need to run it, and the “ProcessRequest” method that does the actual dog work of the redirect.

    I have chosen to use a “MovedPermanently“ status so that the search engines will catch on more quickly and the new URL should quite quickly replace the old.

    If we just added this handler to the web application we would loose all of our .aspx pages and only see a blank page for those that are not valid for this handler.

    To handle this the easiest way is to inherit from the existing “PageHandlerFactory” that is the default in ASP.NET.

    ```
    Imports System.Web

    Namespace Core.Handlers

        Public Class CustomPageHandlerFactory
            Inherits PageHandlerFactory

            Public Overrides Function GetHandler(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpContext, _
                                                 ByVal requestType As String, _
                                                 ByVal virtualPath As String, _
                                                 ByVal path As String) As IHttpHandler
                If BlogRedirectHandler.IsValidToRun(context, requestType, virtualPath, path) Then
                    Return New BlogRedirectHandler
                Else
                    Return MyBase.GetHandler(context, requestType, virtualPath, path)
                End If
            End Function
        End Class

    End Namespace
    ```

    Then all we need to do is call our IsValidToRun method and either run the base (default) GetHandler or return our new handler…

    I now have a nice hosted version of the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://rddotnet.com/tfsstickybuddy.aspx) that is fairly fast and deploys using ClickOnce, but you do need to make sure that you already have .NET 3.5 and Team Explorer 2008 installed first…

    Well I finally got of by behind and set up a site for [RDdotNET](http://rddotnet.com), its not special or clever, but it does let me host ClickOnce Applications like the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://rddotnet.com/tfsstickybuddy) and give a single portal to my other tools. I only have [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Sticky Buddy and [TFS Event Handler](http://rddotnet.com/TFSEventHandler.aspx) up at the moment, but I will expand on that.

    Eventually all my bits and bobs will be up [there](http://rddotnet.com) with my blog over [here](http://hinshelwood.com).

    Hopefully you will find the ClickOnce hosting useful, if not the site content…

    Although the site is a little skewed today…

    [![image](images/MessengerUnited_6E4C-image_3-1-1.png)](http://www.messengerunited.com/)
    { .post-img }

    …This is an [excellent application](http://www.messengerunited.com/). Role on the LinkedIn sync.

    When you click the button (the big green one) you get taken to [another site](http://www.messengerunited.com/) that has the actual application on it.

    [![image](images/MessengerUnited_6E4C-image_6-2-2.png)](https://www.invite2messenger.net)
    { .post-img }

    This it seams is part of Microsoft's Connected Systems initiative that Bill has been pushing for years. They are now starting to open up their services (recently with their Exchange and Messenger products) to allow better integration with third parties.

    For those that do not use Hotmail (perish the thought) the only sync / import available is the Facebook one.

    If, like me you are trying to run tests against your web services and you the error below, you will need to give permission to the service account that runs your Build Agent to create listeners in IIS.

    > Class Initialization method TestServiceProjects.RentalCentreServiceRemoteTest.MyClassInitialize threw exception. System.ServiceModel.AddressAccessDeniedException:  System.ServiceModel.AddressAccessDeniedException: HTTP could not register URL [http://+:3456/RentalCentreServiceRemoteTest/](http://+:3456/RentalCentreServiceRemoteTest/). Your process does not have access rights to this namespace (see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70353](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70353) for details). --->  System.Net.HttpListenerException: Access is denied.

    I first tried giving the service account administrator rights, and this did not work, so I added “Act as part of operating system”. Lo and behold, that worked…

    Happy now…

    There seams to be a problem in MSBuild when you add an “Accessor” as part of a Unit Test project.

    > ```

    An Accessor allows your test project to access code that would normally be “Private” or “Friend” from outside the Assembly that it resides in.

    [![image](images/TFSErrorMSB4018TheBuildShadowTasktaskfai_EDA9-image_thumb-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSErrorMSB4018TheBuildShadowTasktaskfai_EDA9-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    It creates a little file with the “.accessor” extension that is the same name as your DLL, and contains the name of the DLL.

    [![image](images/TFSErrorMSB4018TheBuildShadowTasktaskfai_EDA9-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSErrorMSB4018TheBuildShadowTasktaskfai_EDA9-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you remove this file then your remote MSBuild server will then build you solution successfully again including running your Unit Tests.

    You should be able to create a SharePoint "Solution" in Visual Studio. Then Add Feature projects to it that can contain many list or site bits with the ability to compile and build the solution file that can be uploaded into SharePoint with out all of this faffing around...

    Oh, and you should be able to do it remotely! On a workstation!

    If you are wanting to developer solutions for SharePoint in Visual Studio 2008 then you need a couple of things to get started:

    - **You will need to install VSeWSS 1.1.
      **[http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx")
    - Then follow the instructions on [Martin Vollmer\`s Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/default.aspx)  in his post on getting it installed without Sharepoint.  
       [http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx")
    - And to get workflow working you need to again follow the instructions on [Martin Vollmer\`s Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/default.aspx)  in his post on getting the workflow dll's out of the server.  
       [http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx")

    Although this is convoluted it does work...

    If you are developing for either of my MOSS Codeplex Projects ([MOSS Time Off Management](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSTOM) or [MOSS Designer Workflow Activities](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSActivities)) then you will need this up and running if you do not want to have to install everything on a SharePoint server...

    **UPDATE: If you can get this to work, you must be a SharePoint developer guru**

    After having thought about it for a while I think that my idea not to create a separate TOM system independent of MOSS was a bit of a silly idea. The whole point of the system is to exist in any environment, so the first version will exist separate of SharePoint. The main advantage of this will be debugging and testing....

    The first version will use simple web pages as stubs to the SharePoint bits, but the final version will need to run in MOSS.

    This project will give me an idea of how complicated it will be to produce SharePoint features and how much time will be spent in bug fixing...

    Over the next few weeks I will be blogging my escapades in developing an application solution for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. I have entitled the application "_MOSS Time Off Management_" and it will be up on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") for all to follow @ [http://www.codeplex.com/mosstom](http://www.codeplex.com/mosstom) (coming soon).

    The idea behind this application is twofold:

    First to give me a project that I can get my teeth into to learn all of the ins and outs of the SharePoint model, including how one debugs and developers for it. And second to give my company a working system at the end... There is nothing like dogfooding and everyone should eat what they make.

    It will be build in .NET 3.5 and use a combination of WebParts, Workflow, InfoPath, SQL Server and a few other assorted munchies. I will be trying to include Test Driven Devolvement (but that will be determined by SharePoint) and I will be building the installer first.

    Although this application will not stand alone (although I may have to build a skeleton if SharePoint becomes a pain), it will be able to be deployed globaly on many servers (SharePoint farms) around the world with a single point of truth...

    Now I am scared....

    Spent the day yesterday at the MSDN Roadshow in Glasgow. It was a very good day that provided me a deeper insight into the ADO.NET Entity Framework, Data Services and Silverlight 2 (Which I like even though I did not like Silverlight 1... no JavaScript![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif)).

    What a fantastic day... Thanks to [Colin Mackay](http://blog.colinmackay.net/) for the fantastic job he did organising this event and I hope that there will be more events like this in Glasgow in the future...

    I can only comment on the speakers that I attended, but they were all very impressive...

    [Guy Smith-Ferrier](http://www.guysmithferrier.com/details.aspx?Entry=221) did an excellent presentation on [ADO.NET Data Services](http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Guy_Smith_Ferrier) which I now understand and see the benefits and applications of, thanks Guy. And [Ben Lamb](http://www.benlamb.com) did an interesting session on "Anti-Patterns" that left me thinking a lot about code I had written in the past, you can find his presentation on his [blog](http://www.benlamb.com)...

    After lunch when you normally start to fall asleep we got a session on Continuous integration from [Richard Fennell](http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/rfennell/archive/2008/05/11/developer-day-scotland.aspx) that sparked my interest (more on team system Richard). Then came the speaker that probably had the most impact for me. The talk was entitled "Red, Green, Refactor!" and was all about "Test Driven Development" from a guy that seams to know much about the subject, [Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2008/05/developer-day-scotland-post-conference.html).

    If I took anything away from this day, it was that although I know a lot, I know very little....

The is a bug in the Visual Basic compiler that causes this problem and it requires a manual fix:

This causes no end of problems with signed assemblies. The KBAlertz article above implies that this only affects Workflow assemblies. But I have has t6his problem in other types of Visual Basic project.

    This is not a big problem unless you are creating custom assemblies for SharePoint and have a convoluted deployment process before you can test, and can't figure out why you changes are not going through...

    I have been using the [Useful Sharepoint Designer Custom Workflow Activities](http://www.codeplex.com/SPDActivities/) project on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") to augment the capabilities of SharePoint Designer to add such features as "Start another workflow" which is very useful for compartmentalising your workflow so as to not make it too complicated.

    Well I found a wee problem. The "**[Lookup user info](http://www.codeplex.com/SPDActivities/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Lookup%20user%20info&referringTitle=Home)**" activity only looks up information from the site and not from the users MOSS profile. So I started another [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") project for activities I will be building and I am creating once called "[Lookup user profile](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSActivities/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Lookup%20user%20profile&referringTitle=Home)" on my shiny new [MOSS Designer Workflow Activities](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSActivities) project.

    This one Activity will alleviate my immediate need, but I can see many more in the future...

    ![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_6-4-4.png)Well the faeces hit the fan at work today...let me explain...
    { .post-img }

    We have a completely unmanaged Sharepoint Portal server at work. It was installed in early 2004 and has been running in self service mode ever since. Not all of the company is using it, but those that are, are using it heavily. Particularly areas that service customers and one customer specifically use it so completely that that area of the business would find it hard to function if it was not available.

    So early this year I started a project to migrate / rewrite for Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server (MOSS) and we now have a proof of concept site online that demos the features and architecture of a finished portal. This POC version was scheduled for go live in Q4...

    This had been ticking over for a while with a number of project requests getting in the way, the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) for one, along with many others. As the only .NET developer in EMEA it can get a little hectic.

    [![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_4.png)Recently I had a project to make a copy of one of the Sharepoint 2003 portals and I ran into a number of problems... now, I am not a Sharepoint 2003 guru, having had most of my exposure to it with Team Foundation Server deployments, but I followed all of the documented approaches for copying a site, to no avail. For each attempt, of which there were many, and for each approach, again there were many, I ran into problem after problem. Either the export commands failed, or the import command failed, and the resultant restore looked nothing like the original having been mangled during the process.

    The result of my efforts was a custom APS.NET application that replicated the functionality provided by Sharepoint (it is worth noting that the site did not use much of SharePoint to do its job). Problem solved...

    But not really... I still had a soon to be mangled Sharepoint 2003 portal server with over a thousand users on it.

    [![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_6.png) Then the bomb shell landed... I had been getting some reports of problems for the users of a site that is used to handle a customers contract, these users were running into real performance issues and functionality limitations. They were aware of the proof of concept MOSS deployment and wanted a look, so when some of the guys were in the office I stupidly, as I always do, started showing off MOSS features and functionality that puts Sharepoint Portal server to shame. How stupid of me... in my zeal to get MOSS deployed to the business I inadvertently stepped on a land mine. They went home, spoke to a few people and lo and behold, my deadline has been moved up from Q4 to now.... or at leas as soon as possible, and specifically for the aforementioned site.

    **The Plan**

    [![image](images/Majordeadline_13060-image_thumb_5-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Majordeadline_13060-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    Apart from quitting, having a nervous breakdown and ultimately committing [Seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku) I had to come up with a way of fulfilling this insane idea of a deployment schedule.

    To do this I plan to use the Business Data Catalog to connect to customer data, and create a portal site that dynamically build sites using an as yet non existent site template for a specified customer. This way there is system data available for creating excel services reports and stats along with document library and InfoPath forms. The site should look exactly like the My Sites, but for a customer. It can then be branched out for other entitles like products (we build them and then rent and service them) and contracts.

    In the immortal words of the Windows 2003 Active Directory Installer:

    > _This may take some time, or considerably longer..._

    I have been having a lot of Kerberos double hop problems on the network at work, and although I have not yet managed to fix them... I did find these useful pages:

    [What Is Kerberos Authentication?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/792ed95d-6f13-4181-a218-e4eaab361c1b1033.mspx?mfr=true) - Good high level overview...

    [Troubleshooting Kerberos Delegation](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/security/tkerbdel.mspx) - which I think I may find the most useful...

    I will keep you updated on my progress...

    This is the first [full release](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) of the [TFS Sticky Buddy application](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) written in VB.NET 9 and WPF with Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit.

    [![image](images/TFSStickyBuddyv1.0_8FC3-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddyv1.0_8FC3-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    The application provides a graphical view of TFS Work Items and allow user to navigate round either the Area (Codeplex Component) or Iteration (Codeplex Release) tree. It displays all the work items loaded (by selecting a Team Query) on the node, colour coded by Work Item State.

    You can edit and add templates for displaying Work Items loaded for different Life Cycle templates in Team Foundation Server by editing the XAML in the Life Cycle resource directory (#InstallLocation#RDdotNetTFS Sticky BuddyResourcesLifeCycle\[Name\]\[Name\]Resources.xaml) and editing the resource file. Though I would suggest creating a new file for each Life Cycle you want to display. Out of the box I have supported a Default option that works for most TFS Process Templates, and a Codeplex option for supporting your Codeplex projects.

    **Usage**

    When the TFS Sticky Buddy application starts you will be prompted to select a team foundation server from the list (if you do not see any servers then you must set them up using Team Explorer) which will populate the Projects and other menus. The navigation diagram will by default render the first project in your selected TFS server.

    Use the "Queries" menu to select which work items that you want loaded into your view.

    **System Requirements**

    .NET Framework 3.5 Visual Studio 2008 Team Explorer (not forced) Access to a Team Foundation Server (not provided)

    If you already have CTP1 or CTP2 you should [update](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) to the [full release now](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx)...

    As you have probably noticed I have been soldiering on with the [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) project, and I though I would share.

    [![image](images/EndofanotherStickyweek_F60A-image_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-EndofanotherStickyweek_F60A-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    With the next release you will be able to connect to any external (not on same domain) [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server including [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") servers and load up your projects. The [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) guest stars above.

    [![image](images/EndofanotherStickyweek_F60A-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-EndofanotherStickyweek_F60A-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    One of the major improvements is the ability to add skins for different TFS life Cycles. I have a "Default" setting and you can change it to the [Codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com) Template. Over time I will be adding others, but I only have access to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), and my local production TFS server, so if you want a custom one, you may need to build it yourself...

    If you want a go of these features you will need to [download the source](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx) and build the main folder code... but there will be a release soon..

    All to soon and it is that time again...I have been developing, hell bent on getting a [working sticky buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) online, and here it is...

    [**Download TFS Stick Buddy v0.4.0 CTP2 Now**](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx)**...**

    [![image_thumb23](images/TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb23_thumb-8-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb23_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    With this version you can select what work items you want to display by choosing a Query from the list. You can add queries to your list through Visual Studio and the TFS Web Access power tool to allow customisation of the display for your needs and project template types. If you do not have a work item called "Requirement" and instead use one called "Customer Request" then you just need to make a query that pulls this information back.

    [![image_thumb24](images/TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb24_thumb-9-9.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb24_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    When you open [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) you will be asked to select a Team Server to connect to. If you have a proxy, like I do in the office, you will not be able to connect to an external TFS server through it as your credentials will be wrong... maybe I need a [work item](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/WorkItem/List.aspx) for that ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif)
    { .post-img }

    Once you have selected your team server you will need to wait for it to authenticate, but I added a little "loading" window to keep you happy as it may take a little while to authenticate depending on the speed on your network and the load on your TFS server.

    When the load it complete you will have access to the menu options, but it will have automatically loaded the first Team Project on your server and the first work item query on your project (which tends to be "Active bugs").

    [![image_thumb25](images/TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb25_thumb-10-10.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickBuddyv0.4.0CTP2released_12E38-image_thumb25_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you have this many bugs, you may need to invest more in quality control...

    The application will load all of your Areas and their hierarchy by default and display any work items in your selected query on that Area. You can see that it will display everything on the node and colour code it depending on the state of the work item:

    I plan to have other options, but I will need to make some changes to the skining files, but you get the picture...

    I hope everyone "team servery" has a go, and don't be shy about [reporting bugs](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/WorkItem/List.aspx) and [requesting features](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/WorkItem/List.aspx).

I have used the source code from the Family.Show project to create functionality and a look that is appealing.
    { .post-img }

    You can download it from the [Codeplex site](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) and you can raise bugs with the [issue tracker](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/WorkItem/List.aspx)...

    Please remember that this is a CTP and is not fully functional. With this version you can see how your Areas and Iterations tree diagrammatically. I intend to display the work items within the body of the node and display a different view depending on the zoom level...

    { .post-img }

    I have yet to skin the whole application so you will see some bitts that look exactly like the [Family.Show](http://www.vertigo.com/familyshow.aspx) application from [Vertigo](http://www.vertigo.com)... yes I know.. I am a lazy developer...

    [![TFSStickyBuddy_Core_ClassDiagram](images/CreatingabetterTFSStickyBuddyCore_8719-TFSStickyBuddy_Core_ClassDiagram_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-CreatingabetterTFSStickyBuddyCore_8719-TFSStickyBuddy_Core_ClassDiagram_4.png) Over the last week I have been looking at the source for the [Family.Show](http://www.vertigo.com/familyshow.aspx) application from [Vertigo](http://www.vertigo.com/). I needed to look at methods of presentation of hierarchical information graphically using WPF and I saw this as a good representation of that sort of data. So I se about not only converting it to VB.NET but adding generics to the mix.
    { .post-img }

    The first part of the application is the core objects that represent the data and allow interaction in a way that WPF can handle. This means using Observable Collections and implementing INotifyPropertyChanged to allow a higher level of interaction. I wanted to support any Source object type as well as my own custom types, so the type needed to be nested with a Wrapper that gives the illusion that it is a solid type, but in actual fact it is a soft wrapper that allows the system to interact with it without really understanding the type. The specific understanding of the type is done at a much higher level.

    You will need to open this diagram in a new window to get the effect, but it is a completely generic representation of Parent, Child and  Sibling relationships for any object regardless of wither you have access to the source or not.

    This is not currently designed to be an editable object, but inheriting from the [ItemWrapper](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/SourceControl/FileView.aspx?itemId=157013&changeSetId=10168) class would allow this, but would require a modification to the framework to handle the inherited type. Maybe v2...

    I seam to be having a little problem. Now, this may be me being stupid, but I can't get an ObservableCollection to work if you pass it a generic type!

    For example, consider the following code:

    > ```
    > Public Class ItemBitCollection(Of TItem)
    >     Inherits ObservableCollection(Of ItemBit(Of TItem))
    >
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > Public Class ItemBit(Of TItem)
    >
    >     Private m_item As TItem
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > ```

    Now, if you create an instance of ItemBitCollection you will see an error on the IDE regardless of wither you use a custom object type or a String type to initialise it:

    [![image](images/BuginObservableCollection_9BAF-image_thumb-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-BuginObservableCollection_9BAF-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    Why does this not work? What is ObservableCollection doing that maybe it should not? Time to get Reflector out...

    After some looking at the source I am still none the wiser. Even if you dumb down your classes to the bare minimum you cant pass a generic type into an ObservableCollection.

    This is a limitation if you ask me...

    **Annoying solution:**

    If you create a fixed class type:

    > ```
    > Public Class ItemBitCollection(Of TItemBit)
    >     Inherits ObservableCollection(Of TItemBit)
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > Public MustInherit Class ItemBit(Of TItem)
    >
    >     Private m_item As TItem
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > Public Class DefaultItemBit
    >     Inherits ItemBit(Of String)
    >
    > End Class
    >
    > ```

    And then pass that class in it does work:

    > ```
    > Dim o As New ItemBitCollection(Of DefaultItemBit)
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    Although this is a work around, it causes other problems in my code... Ahh well... worth a try...

    I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of interest in the [Sticky Buddy project](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/02/05/tfs-sticky-buddy-codeplex-project.aspx). I was particularly exited when Siddharth Bhatia contacted me, but disappointed that he could not get the proof of concept versions to work.

    Well, hopefully that is about to change with the addition of [Eric Willeke](http://manicprogrammer.com/cs/blogs/willeke/default.aspx) to the development team. if you have been following the project you will see that he has been a avid tester from the beginning and I would like to welcome him fully on board for the next leg of the project...

    Eric, I hope you are good a deciphering convoluted and complicated code that at times borders on the nasty!

    I have found a small bug (as in, "Not working as expected!") in the new .NET 3.5 PrincipalContext classes. When you are running on an ASP.NET site in impersonation mode you cannot retrieve information from active directory without the following error:

    > _System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80072020): An operations error occurred. at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind(Boolean throwIfFail) at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind() at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_AdsObject() at System.DirectoryServices.PropertyValueCollection.PopulateList() at System.DirectoryServices.PropertyValueCollection..ctor(DirectoryEntry entry, String propertyName) at System.DirectoryServices.PropertyCollection.get_Item(String propertyName) at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.DoLDAPDirectoryInitNoContainer() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.DoDomainInit() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.Initialize() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.get_QueryCtx() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.Principal.FindByIdentityWithTypeHelper(PrincipalContext context, Type principalType, Nullable\`1 identityType, String identityValue, DateTime refDate) at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.Principal.FindByIdentityWithType(PrincipalContext context, Type principalType, IdentityType identityType, String identityValue) at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(PrincipalContext context, IdentityType identityType, String identityValue) at UI_Controls_SharepointControl.Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e)_

    You need to specify a fixed account to access AD using:

    > Dim ctx As New PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "\[domain\]", "\[accountName\]", "\[password\]")
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    This is not so good! What if I wanted to use the current users credentials to update only fields that they are allowed to update in AD? If I use a static account that can access any users fields then this becomes a security risk.

    Ahh well, I will live with it for now, but if anyone has another suggestion...

    Imports System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement
    ```

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    [![](images/AccountManagement-1-1.jpg)](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/AccountManagement-1-1.jpg "Account Management") In WPF development you can't just use the "My.User.Name" classes as it is not set by default. If you still want to use it you can _"My.User.InitializeWithWindowsUser()"_ to have it setup, but there is a better way.
    { .post-img }

    If you are using Active Directory .Net 3.5 has provided a new way to access information...

    There is a new assembly called "System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement" that encapsulates all of the logic for accessing security information in a number of ways.

    You can create a link to your local Active Directory  by calling:

    > ```
    >  Dim ctx As New PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain)
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    The options for conencting are:

    - **ApplicationDirectory** - The application directory store. This represents the AD LDS store.

    - **Domain** - The domain store. This represents the AD DS store.

    - **Machine** - The computer store. This represents the SAM store.

    These options allow for most security authentications in your .NET applications, and it does not stop with wrapping the top level AD. if you want to access and control a user you need only:

    > ```
    > Dim u As UserPrincipal = UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(ctx, IdentityType.Sid, WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent.User.Value)
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    I really like this as often I have has to build and Google (more the later than the former) class library for manipulating Active Directory objects, and you need not just use the Sid. You can use:

    - **DistinguishedName** - The identity is a Distinguished Name (DN).

    - **Guid** - The identity is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).

    - **Name** - The identity is a name.

    - **SamAccountName** - The identity is a Security Account Manager (SAM) name.

    - **Sid** - The identity is a Security Identifier (SID) in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) format.

    - **UserPrincipalName** - The identity is a User Principal Name (UPN).

    And this is just the direct load of a user object. There are Group object as well as fill search capability with the PrincipalSearcher and various other bits and bobs...

    Well thats my find of the day ![smile_nerd](images/smile_nerd-3-3.gif)

    Documentation, documentation and more documentation.. The life blood of IT. The only problem being that it is very difficult for a technically minded individual such as myself to write documentation with NO technical content what so ever! These documents are what the business really want; They do not care that the workflow capabilities of SharePoint bring easer workflow to the masses, they only care that it is there; They do not care that we will be deploying on 2 front end servers with 1 application server and a database server for the first initial farm, they only care that it will work.

    With this in mind how do you impress upon them the potential of the system? Well... you don't, you can only build a system with the capabilities that you think they will need and once you get down to the details of migrating their applications will you actually get any meaningfully feedback..

    That is the advantage of using SharePoint. It can do pretty much anything: If not out of the box, then you can build on it, or get contractors to work on it...

    Its all about standards...

    [![TFS Sticky Buddy (WinForms) Screenshot](images/TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_thumb-2-8.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_2.png) I had a lot of fun trying to lay out my [TFS Sticky Buddy](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) project using Windows Forms, and eventually decided that it was way to fiddle doing it in a Forms based application. It was not just that tables and panels don't work as I expected, but that there were way to many bits that were more difficult than they should be. This is mostly down to my inexperience and down right ineptitude with graphics and UI's, but it still should not be this hard. ![smile_baringteeth](images/smile_baringteeth-4-2.gif)
    { .post-img }

    I know that the picture on the right is not pretty, and the colours I have picked are pretty random to help solve the layout issues, but the application works....

    The problems, as you can see from the image are layout ones. I tried the FlowLayoutPanel, but I could for the life of me, not get the bloody boxes to stretch to fit the contents. Then I used the TableLayoutPanel, and ran into what you see above...Yeuch ![smile_sniff](images/smile_sniff-6-4.gif) (Scottish for Yuck (Like Loch)).
    { .post-img }

    I guess I spent too much time doing web development when I was younger, but now when I try to go back to web based stuff I always end up shouting and swearing at the html layouts and growling at the post-back functionality...

    What I needed was something that was a cross between Windows Forms, and Web Forms. Something that had good layout functionality, but without the messing around necessary with HTML and CSS. You see, I like HTML and CSS, except for one little thing... It never does what you tell it. At least forms do what you tell them, and that is sometimes the problem with forms, they do ONLY what you tell them.![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-7-5.gif)
    { .post-img }

    I had only spent a day on the application so far, so I was not overly concerned about the loss of time. I had chosen Windows Forms because I knew it, but deep down I knew that Windows Presentation Foundation was the way to go, I was just scared of the steep clime of understanding...![smile_nerd](images/smile_nerd-5-3.gif)

    [![TFS Sticky Buddy (WPF) Screenshot](images/TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_thumb_1-1-7.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_4.png) Sod it...Of I went with a WPF version... And the result were impressive. Not only have I only spent a day and a half on it, but the immediate learning curve is a lot smaller than I though. Sure, you can add styles and templates among other things, but to get what you get with Windows Forms (only prettier) takes less time, not more, even with the learning curve (but I guess that is dependant on how quick you are ![smile_wink](images/smile_wink-8-6.gif)). And I am sure that once I master the other functionality provided in WPF it will become much easer.
    { .post-img }

    Sure, if you look at the image for the second WPF version you will still see layout problems, but they are minor and fixable (although I am not sure how yet), and the whole thing was a more painless to tweak.

    I will try to release these two versions along with the source code today, but just as a POC (Proof of Concept) to show the potential of the application.

    I want to have nice little callouts of information when you move your mouse over a work item or Area/Iteration, and I am continuing to work on it....

    { .post-img }

    This is a proof of concept release of the Team Foundation Server Sticky Buddy digital dashboard project that is built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This is the main version of the application as the WinForms version of the application has been deprecated. There are some layout issues with this version, but they should be fixed fro the next release. The source code is provided with the installation.

    **Usage**

    When the sample starts you will need to select a team foundation server from the list (if you do not see any servers then you must set them up using Team Explorer) which will populate the Projects list. Once you have selected a project the dashboard will be rendered.

    **System Requirements**

    - .NET Framework 3.5
    - Visual Studio 2008 Team Explorer

    Give it a go, and let me know how you get on.... You can also get a [WinForm](http://hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/02/11/tfs-sticky-buddy-poc-winforms-release.aspx "TFS Sticky Buddy POC (WinForms) release") version of the application.

    I hade been looking with envy at the [digital whiteboard experiment](http://www.agilemanagement.net/Articles/Weblog/DigitalWhiteboardExperime.html), and with dismay at the lack of open source for the project. So...

    [![DigitalWhiteboardJune2007](images/TFSStickyBuddyCodeplexproject_9FDC-DigitalWhiteboardJune2007_thumb-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddyCodeplexproject_9FDC-DigitalWhiteboardJune2007_2.png) I will be creating a version of the [Sticky Buddy idea](http://www.visualbuilder.com/viewdetail.php?group_id=43&id=532&type=1) that will run off Team Foundation Server and allow teams to display information on the status of their development on one or many projects.
    { .post-img }

    The application will be able to be displayed on a projector or large TV screen. The application will consist of a main screen that queries a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Server and pulls a list of projects that the user can select for display and within each project it will display the iteration tree. This tree will be displayed as a set of concentric columns that are populated with "Change Requests" and "Requirements" that are currently within that iteration path.

    Each of the Work Items displayed will show limited information about itself, which user it is assigned to, its Area and title. But it will also display the number of sub items within each item. This will give an indication of the length of time necessary to complete all of the sub-work items within that iteration so it can be moved on to the next.

    A set of rules will determine the colour or icons associated with each item based on their status. These rules may include:

    - Is this item overdue?
    - Does this work item have any blocked work items associated with it?
    - Does this work item have any risks associated with it?

    The resultant Digital Whiteboard will be displayed in our main offices so we will be dogfooding :)

    OK, I now have the additional SPN's added to AD that I mentioned in [my post](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/31/connecting-to-sql-server-using-dns.aspx "Connecting to SQL Server using DNS") and a listing returns:

    > C:>setspn \[servername\]  
    > Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=\[servername\],OU=Member Servers,DC=\[domain\],DC=biz:  
    >     MSSQLSvc/spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:1422  
    >     MSSQLSvc/spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:1433  
    >     MSSQLSvc/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz:1422  
    >     MSSQLSvc/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz:1433  
    >     SMTPSVC/\[servername\]  
    >     SMTPSVC/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz  
    >     HOST/\[servername\].\[domain\]onet.biz  
    >     HOST/\[servername\]

    So when I now try to log into SQL server using spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz/EPDev and Windows Authentication, all is well and I can connect to the server.

    When I try moving the databases I will need to move this SPN to the new SQL Cluster, and it should work there as well.

    Here's hoping...

    SharePoint requires SQL Server. That's a given, but what if you want to move the SQL Server databases to another server? [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") is easy enough to move between servers, but SharePoint is NOT. The only answer I can find is to do a full backup and restore from SharePoint, which takes time and effort.

    > **The Plan**
    >
    > I will use a local SQL server with a named instance of "EPDev", but I will also use a DNS name for the server "_dpdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz_". This will allow me to, hopefully, move the databases without having to spend the weekend doing it. I should be able to backup and turn off the SQL server. Re-point "_dpdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz_" to the new SQL Cluster and restore the databases to the "_dpdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz/EPDev_" instance on that server. Then I will bring up the SharePoint server. This should work, but I have not as yet tested it...

    Hopefully this will not screw up, but I will take steps to provide for that

    probability possibility...

    Microsoft: if you are listening, please make moving a SharePoint database as easy as TFS!

    I currently have the task of setting up SharePoint Portal for my company. But here is the kicker, they have users in almost every country in the world, so how to structure the deployment.

    I knew roughly how to do this, but a post by [Jose Barreto](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/) entitled "[The Legend of the Single, Multi-Terabyte, Replicating SharePoint Database](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2007/10/25/the-legend-of-the-single-multi-terabyte-replicating-sharepoint-database.aspx)" that really caught my eye. I knew that this was how it worked, but I did not actually know! if you take my meaning. This post spreads light on the Architecture of a SharePoint deployment across multiple continents.

    I have found many of his [posts](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/tags/sharepoint/default.aspx) to be invaluable in my SharePoint planning and you should have a look if you are doing the same...

    I have added an extra event handler to the [TFS Event Handler (Prototype)](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=5057), and this makes two.

    **Assigned To Handler**

    The Assigned to handler send a users an email when a work item is assigned to them unless they did the assigning themselves.

    **Reassigned Handler**

    The reassigned handler send an email to a user to whom a work item used to be assigned, letting them know that they no longer have that piece of work in their list.

    These handlers are easily added to a current deployment and are packaged together. You will need to update the version of your prototype deployment by [downloading](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=5057) the latest version, but it does fix a number of found bugs.

    Once you have the new version, download the Assignment Handlers rar file from the release page and extract them into the "_c:Program FilesRDdotNetRDdotNet Team Server Event Handler (Prototype)EventHandlersWorkItemTracking_" folder.

    Stop the "_[TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler (Prototype)_" service and open the "_[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TFSEventHandler.exe.config_" file with notepad.

    if you want the AssignedToHandler to work ad the following line:

    > ```
    > <Handler type="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.AssignedToHandler"
    >          assemblyFileName="RDdotNet.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Assignement.dll"
    >          assemblyFileLocation="~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking">
    > </Handler>
    > ```

    And if you want the Reassigned handler to work add the following line:

    > <Handler type\="[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.ReAssignedHandler"  
    >         assemblyFileName\="[RDdotNet](http://www.rddotnet.com "RDdotNet - Reality Dysfunction .NET").TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Assignement.dll"  
    >         assemblyFileLocation\="~EventHandlersWorkItemTracking"\>  
    > </Handler\>

    [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    If you want both to work...then add both...easy.

    If you want to use Kerberos authentication and not NTLM with SharePoint then there are some extra tasks that you need to get someone with Domain Admin privileges to perform. For EVERY dns / port combination a SPN needs to be added to Active Directory to tell it that it  is allowed to use Kerberos to authenticate a specific account or server to that URL. In a production environment with a farm of multiple server you will need to use the account option.

    The account option lets you create an Active Directory account called..say... svc_Sharepoint and add a bunch of SPN's to it. This account then needs to be used to run the application you are trying to connect to. So if it is an IIS website then the AppPool needs to run under that account. if it is SQL Server then the services need to run under that account.

    You need to add an SPN for each protocol URL and port combination:

    > setspn -a admin.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a admin.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:8080 \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a bi.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a nrcdashboard.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a ep-dev.\[domain\].biz     \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a team.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a search.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a my.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a technet.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_sharepoint  
    > setspn -a tfs01.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_tfsservices  
    > setspn -a tfs01.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:8080 \[domain\]svc_tfsservices  
    > setspn -a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server").ep-dev.\[domain\].biz \[domain\]svc_tfsservices

    These SPN's will allow authentication to work on these domains, but it does require Domain Admin to run them. And these are only my initial FQDN for this environment. We will be having a production environment soon and most likely a UAT environment before we start any development work on our Enterprise Portal.

    I am having occasion to rebuild my Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) development server. In fact, I killed it by adding a Business Data Catalog (BDC) that pointed to a table that had just over a million rows... Now, maybe this would not have caused a problem if I was not using a single server deployment with SQL server on the same box...

    That's the way the OS crumbles ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-9-9.gif)
    { .post-img }

    Anyway, I am installing from a blank VM helpfully provided by our Infrastructure team. The plan is to install all updates before installing MOSS, this includes .NET 3.5 as some of the applications I will be putting on the server will be using it.

    [![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb-6-6.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    If you just try and run the MOSS install you get a nice little message detailing what you need to install as pre-requisites. I have my .NET 3.5 install running, so that should take care of all but IIS...

    ## Install SQL

    You will need SQL Server installed. As this is a development box and I don't have any licensing consideration for development environments under our enterprise agreement I am using "Developer Edition" which is identical to "Enterprise Edition" of SQL Server. And I am not using a default instance. I will soon be in the possession of a SQL Server 2005 Cluster and all of my systems. SharePoint and [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") will have their databases moved onto that server.

    Now, due to the security requirements of these systems (TFS required DBO and SharePoint required DBCreator) Each one will have its own instance.

    TFS is easy enough to move between servers, but SharePoint is NOT. It would require a full backup (from within SharePoint) and restore to move the databases. But I have a plan.. the [The SharePoint Plan: Database move headache mitigation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/31/the-sharepoint-plan-database-move-headache-mitigation.aspx), but I have know idea wither it will work.

    Anyway, since my SQL Server install is finished...back to the SharePoint install..

    ## Install Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition

    [![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_1-1-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    Make sure that you keep your product key safe, as I have lost mine again... ![smile_cry](images/smile_cry-8-8.gif)
    { .post-img }

    Thank goodness for MSDN...

    [![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_2-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    At the end of the install you get prompted to open the Configuration pages. Well, I'm not.. I am going to get a "VM Snapshot" taken of the server at this point. That should allow me to get back to this point at any time...

    As Service Pack 1 is now available for SharePoint I want to start with SP1. So the next step is to install WSS 3.0 SP1 and then MOS SP1.

    ## Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1

    Hopefully if I install SP1 at this time I will not run into all the problems I (and a lot of other people) had [last time](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx "Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1)").

    { .post-img }

    Aw, crap.. Running the install automatically ran the Configuration Wizard, which I did not want to do at this time. Well looks like I have to..

    [![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_4-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_10.png)
    { .post-img }

    All is good for the new Database setup and it seams to be running through the tasks of pointing the SharePoint installation at the DNS database name. I really do hope that it allows me to change the database location without messing around with SharePoint backups.

    And that's the WSS 3.0 SP1 update on successfully, and with no errors...

    ## Installing Microsoft Office System Server Service Pack 1

    OK, I now have high hopes for this installation as well. After the last one, there does seam to be a likelihood that this will work...

    [![image](images/InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_5-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_12.png)
    { .post-img }

    Success...Ran though fine...

    Well that's it all installed, just waiting for my SPN's so I can start adding sites ![smile_teeth](images/smile_teeth-10-10.gif)

    If you want to connect to a SQL server using DNS you will need to have both the "_SQL Server Browser_" service and an SPN setup in your domain to allow authentication.

    This allows the DNS name that you have setup to authenticate against the SQL Server using integrated authentication.

    > setspn MSSQLSvc/spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:1422 \[servername\]  
    > setspn MSSQLSvc/spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz:1433 \[servername\]

    You will know that you need to do this if all of the below is true:

    1. Pining your domain brings back the correct IP of the server
    2. You can connect to the SQL Server using the server name with Windows Authentication.
    3. You can connect to the SQL server using the IP address with Windows Authentication.
    4. You can NOT connect to the SQL server using the spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz with Windows Authentication.
    5. You can connect to the SQL server using the spdata.ep-dev.\[domain\].biz with SQL Server Authentication.

    You can get he setspn tool from the Windows Server 2003 Admin Pack.

    Use it to see what SPN's already exist and to see how you can utilise them. For example calling setspn on my \[servername\] produced:

    > C:>setspn \[servername\]  
    > Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=\[servername\],OU=Member Servers,DC=\[domain\],DC=biz:  
    >     MSSQLSvc/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz:1422  
    >     MSSQLSvc/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz:1433  
    >     SMTPSVC/\[servername\]  
    >     SMTPSVC/\[servername\].\[domain\].biz  
    >     HOST/\[servername\].\[domain\]onet.biz  
    >     HOST/\[servername\]

    this information helped me identify that the first two "MSSQLSvc" spn's would need to be added to this server. You can add SPN's to accounts as well, but if you only need to access a single server then adding it to an account is a little overkill and probably a security risk.

    I'm off to make a request for infrastructure to run this...![smile_speedy](images/smile_speedy-7-7.gif)

    I found a couple of bugs in the [TFS Event Handler Prototype release](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=5057). As I am still supporting this release (many people use it in production) I have fixed the bugs and uploaded new installers.

    The config files have not changed, so you should make a copy of your config file before you uninstall the application. Then reinstall it and copy the config files back and you will be sorted. I have this version working on a server and sending emails with the default event handler.

    I had already upgraded the solution to Visual Studio 2008, so I went all the way and .Net 3.5 'ed all of the projects as well. The [documentation](<http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Wiki/View.aspx?title=TFS%20Event%20Handler%20(Prototype):%20Documentation>) already exists for you to create your own event handlers and apply them to you team server, but let me know what you are getting your Team Server's to do.

    Some ideas for Event Handlers:

    - Send someone an email when they are assigned a Work Item.(Included in the [Prototype release](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=5057)...)
    - Notify project managers when a new work item is added.
    - If a user checks in code and bypasses the check-in policies, send an email to the entire team to name and shame them ![smile_omg](images/smile_omg-2-2.gif)
      { .post-img }
    - Send an email to all of the developers when a check-in occurs...
    - ...

    **Can you think of any more you would like?** [Send them on a postcard to...](https://www.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ThreadId=21219 "Send me your ideas for new Event Handlers")

    I have just uploaded [CTP 2](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) of the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler).This is a fully functional version of the application and I will be releasing documentation for this in due course, but all configuration of team servers and events is handled through the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler Explorer, but all Event Handlers are setup manually.

    I have attached two executables:

    - **TFSEventHandlerServerSetup** - This file includes the system service as well as the client for running on the same computer.
    - **TFSEventHandlerExplorerSetup** - This contains only the Explorer client that can be installed on any computer for managing any TFS Event Handler deployment.
    - **v0.2.0 (CTP2)** - All of the source for this version.

    You will require Team Explorer 2008 for all variations as well as .NET 3.5

    I know that there was a long time between the [Prototype](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057) and [CTP1](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3910), but for quite a while I did not have access to a Team Server. Now I am in a big push, but [CTP3](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10253) may be a while in coming. There are major changes between [CTP1](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3910) and [CTP2](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=3926), but I will be bug fixing and updating [CTP2](https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=TFSEventHandler&ReleaseId=3926) for a while.

    Now I have the engine relatively stable I want to concentrate on building some Event Handlers. Over the coming weeks I will be using the latest version in a production environment and testing it to the limits. I am pretty positive that I will find problems, but I would be gratefully for feedback on what I have so far. There were nearly 200 downloads of my prototype version, yet little or know feedback... I don't know if that is because it was rubbish or if it was so good there was no need for feedback or bug reports ![smile_wink](images/smile_wink-2-2.gif). I will assume the latter...

    I have just released a [new version](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3910) of the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler. This is a really rough version and you should not be used in a production environment.

    Event handler system will work in this version, but a manual config is required, and the user interface is a bit flaky. Also all errors that occur in an individual handlers are ignored.

    If you are planning to use this in a production environment please consider using the [TFS Event Handler (Prototype)](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057).

    I will probably not be doing any documentation for this version, but I will be updating frequently as I will be using it on my production server and building Event handlers for it.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_thumb-3-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_2.png)
    { .post-img }

    The Client application allows you to connect to any TFS Event Handler and see what the status is. Please note that there is a bug that occurs when you add a new team server that means that it never authenticates. Once you have added it, close the UI and reopen it to solve the problem. Oh, and don't click the "refresh" button (I said the UI was rough).

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_thumb_1-1-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_4.png)
    { .post-img }

    It will take time to augment the UI and I have quite a few ideas in that regard. One of my goals is to allow the upload of "Packages" that contain all the files  necessary to run en Event Handler that might well have supporting files, like html templates for emails...

    At the moment the server component runs in a form, but that will eventually be a service.

    [![image](images/TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_thumb_2-2-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSEventHandlerCTP1Released_F2A4-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    Hopefully buy the end of next week I will have a version of the service stable enough to run as a service, and a version of the UI integrated with Visual Studio 2008.

    Well, that's the plan... ![smile_nerd](images/smile_nerd-5-2.gif)

    [![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb-5-5.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_2.png) I have run into a very vexing problem with one of my applications. I was asked to provide an application that would fin all of the permissions set against Active Directory accounts that have been since removed. These normally show up in the permissions dialogs for folders as the full SID of the account as there is no longer nay way to look it up in Active Directory.
    { .post-img }

    [![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_1-2-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_4.png)I have written a nice little threaded application that lets you select a folder and it finds all of the dead accounts. What it actually does is verify all accounts against Active Directory and flags them if they are not found. This will have the side effect of finding groups and local accounts and thinking they are dead as well. To solve this problem I added a "Safe List" of accounts and as way to add them from the GUI. The system then ignores any account names that are in this list.
    { .post-img }

    All is well...

    But not really. As I moved on to actually deleting the offending ACL's on request, I found it was a little more difficult to actually delete them as .NET seams to ignore my code...

    > ```
    > Private Sub RemoveACL(ByVal DirectoryName As String, _
    >                       ByVal IdentityReference As Security.Principal.IdentityReference)
    >     Dim DS As DirectorySecurity
    >     DS = System.IO.Directory.GetAccessControl(DirectoryName)
    >
    >     DS.PurgeAccessRules(IdentityReference)
    >     DS.PurgeAuditRules(IdentityReference)
    >
    >     System.IO.Directory.SetAccessControl(DirectoryName, DS)
    > End Sub
    > ```
    >
    > [](http://11011.net/software/vspaste)

    Now, this code is fairly simple. First we get the directory security object, then we change the directory security object, and then we save the directory security object.

    The "DirectoryName" object contains a CuteFTP folder:

    [![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_2-3-3.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_6.png)
    { .post-img }

    The "IdentityReference" object contains the offending SID:

    [![image](images/RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_thumb_3-4-4.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-RemovingACLsfordeadADaccounts_C3E6-image_8.png)
    { .post-img }

    This code should work, and I have used a similar piece to add permissions, so why on earth can't I remove them!

    **UPDATE:** [**I have added a question about this to the MSDN Forums**](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2722189&SiteID=1&mode=1)

    Or anywhere you can put some HTML. This is really easy and allows you to have something like:

    [![Martin Hinshelwood's Twitter](images/Hinshelm.1-1-1.gif)](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Twitter/Hinshelm/~6/1)
    { .post-img }

    As Twitter publish your twit list as an RSS feed you can just add it to FeedBurner and use one of its tools to create the above image.

    So easy it hurts...

    [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com) is getting a face lift and [David Silverlight](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/default.aspx) (yes a man so great that an entire platform was named after him) is asking for [contributions](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) to this... So head on over to the [community credit forum](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) and get suggesting...

    My Suggestions:

    - [The ability to have blog posts submitted into a specific category, or moved to that category.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4315/ShowThread.aspx#4315)
      You should be able to change the category from an automatically submitted contribution.
      This should be possible in two ways...
      1\. manually: users should be able to login and change the status of an automatically submitted entry. If they change it, it would require moderation...
      2\. tagging: users can add tags to their posts that could automate the above process. CC would parse the page and extract the tag and change the category.
      I think that the first option is required, but the second is optional....
    - [Profile page uses username and not email address...](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4316/ShowThread.aspx#4316)
      We don't want spammers getting to our email addresses...
      Username should be used whenever displaying user data, that way our email addresses will not be visible...
    - [All profiles should be listed.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4318/ShowThread.aspx#4318)
      It is not possible to Google for your profile and this should be possible. My profile does come up, but I created a mapped URL and put it on my blog.
    - [Search engine optimisation / Faster load times for pages.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4319/ShowThread.aspx#4319)
      I think these two go hand in hand. They pages for the site should be lighter on graphics and that should make them load quicker. If a little though was put towards SEO then more people would find the pages, especially the profiles within the site.. Any page that comes up would push traffic to the site...
    - [Points for moderating Credits](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4320/ShowThread.aspx#4320)
      If, like me, you are a moderator for credits (not the discussion boards) then there should be a points system for it. it should be based on how much work is involved in moderating the submission.

          Maybe a good way would be to give the moderator 10% of the points awarded to the user ![Smile](images/emotion-1.gif). This would certainly make me happy.

      { .post-img }
      Articles are especially difficult to moderate as you need to search the web for similar titles and correlate dates.

    - [Guest developers](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4321/ShowThread.aspx#4321)
      It should be possible to drive traffic to the forums and encourage users to use them if you have guest developers for topics.
      This would have a specific person with a specific skills moderating and answering forum posts on a specific topic. That developer would get extra points for being a Guest Developer and all his/her posts marked as "Expert answers".
      This will provide developers with a sense of Ownership of the forums without having to have everyone as a moderator all of the time. the "Guest Developer" feature should be limited to a specific forum for a specific time.

    That's all I can think of just now, but I may be back ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif) 
    { .post-img }

    **If you have any comments on these topics can you please use the title links to get to the forum and post them there...**

    You can't add a new unique auto-generated ID to a SharePoint list, but there already is one there! If you edit the "All Items" view you will see a list of columns that do not have the display option checked.

    There are quite a few of these columns that exist but that are never displayed, like "Created By" and "Created". These fields are used within SharePoint, but they are not displayed by default so as not to clutter up the display. You can't edit these fields, but you can display them to the user. if you check the "Display" box beside the ID field you will get a unique and auto-generated ID field displayed in your list.

    As I now have a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server in the office and we have  Go-Live on 1st February I will be revisiting the TFS Event Handler prototype. I think there is too much work in the main code to get it working, but I should be able to rework the Prototype for Visual Studio 2008 and Team Foundation Server 2008.

    Hopefully this will not be much work...

    Well, I was wrong... Looks like some language compatibility problems...

    I decided as part of my .NET 3.5 learning curve to rebuild [Duncan Mackenzie](http://duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/default.aspx)'s [Xbox to Twitter application](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/using-the-xbox-to-twitter-app-please-update-your-client/default.aspx) just for fun...

    When you call his web service you get a XboxInfo class back that contains all of your Xbox Live Information. I wanted to be able to add a method to this called "ToInstanceString" that I would use to both display your Status, and to detect when it had changed.

    In VB.NET you add Extension methods to a Module. One thing worth noting is that you can control the scope of the extension method with the Namespace. If you add a namespace of "MyApp.Mynamespace" your method will only be available within that namespace and not at the "MyApp" level.

    > ```
    > Public Module XboxExtensions
    >
    >     <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _

    You need to annotate the method with  the "System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()" attribute, and make sure that the first parameter of the method is the type that you want to extend...

    You can add extension methods randomly within your code, but it makes sense to put them all together in categorised module for future use. Although this one is specific to this application, you can probably see many circumstances where you could create generic and useful methods to add to things like collections and the like...

    Have fun...

    I have updated the [Xbox Live to Twitter application](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/04/xbox-live-to-twitter.aspx) and it works quite well now. There are currently too many updates as you can see from my twitter on the left of my blog ![smile_omg](images/smile_omg-2-2.gif).
    { .post-img }

    I will hopefully be adding some more customisation functionality to allow "only online" or "only title" changes to propagate. I may try to add some SQL Compact bits so differences in Achievements can be logged, but the data is currently limited...

    I like this play pen as it allows me to explore some of the .NET 3.5 functionality and improve (much needed) my UI skills.

    You can [download the application](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) from [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com) along with all the [source code](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus).

    [![image](images/ReturninganAnonymoustype_8A86-image_thumb-1-2.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ReturninganAnonymoustype_8A86-image_2.png) In VB.NET it is actually possible to return an Anonymous type from a function and use it somewhere else. In VB.NET you need to use late binding so you can't change the "Option strict" compiler option to true as I have always done in the past. This option, that defaults to "Off", is the main reason that C# developers scoff at VB, but this feature is now available, controversially in C#.
    { .post-img }

    In this example I created an anonymous type that has three properties.

    > ```
    >     Public Function GetTwiterCredentials() As Object
    >         If Not My.Settings.TwitterEmail.Length > 3 Then
    >             GetSettings()
    >         End If
    >         If Not My.Settings.TwitterPassword.Length > 3 Then
    >             GetSettings()
    >         End If
    >         If Not My.Settings.TwitterUsername.Length > 3 Then
    >             GetSettings()
    >         End If
    >         Return New With { _
    >                     .Email = My.Settings.TwitterEmail, _
    >                     .Password = My.Settings.TwitterPassword, _
    >                     .Username = My.Settings.TwitterUsername _
    >                         }
    >     End Function
    > ```

    The use of this is very simple, although I would like an option other than to return "Object" so Visual Studio knows that it is an anonymous type.

    > ```
    >             Dim TwiterCredentials = View.GetTwiterCredentials
    >             Dim result As String = ""
    >             result = Twitter.TwitterAPI.UpdateStatus( _
    >                                     status, _
    >                                     TwiterCredentials.Email, _
    >                                     TwiterCredentials.Password _
    >                                     )
    > ```

    There is no intellisense with this, so you have to know what the options are. Hopefully in future versions this will be rectified.

    I had been trying to find an application that provided updates to twitter from my Xbox. There is such an application written by [Duncan Mackenzie](http://duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/default.aspx), but I could not get it to work. I tried everything and ended up decompiling the application to see what was wrong. Well, it seamed that the guts of the application was missing! The source code has all of the UI elements, but none of the bit to do the updates.

    I tested the web service and it worked, so the only thing to do (Duncan has not updated the application since May 2007) was to write my own version. As I did not have access to Xbox Live data directly, I have leveraged Duncan's web service and only created the front end.

    You can [download the application](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) from [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") along with all the [source code](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus).

    if you have any problems, please create or vote for Issues via the interface![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif).
