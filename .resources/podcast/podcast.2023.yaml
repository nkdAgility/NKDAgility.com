    In this month's edition of Agile Actually, Martin and Simon explore the rise of remote work and whether working from the office, as we knew it, is dead.

    Some interesting insights from two experts who are both Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Trainers in addition to agile coaches and agile consultants, and how the rise of remote work has impacted the effectiveness of training, [coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}), and consulting. It may surprise you.

    In this month's episode of Agile Actually, we picked up some whispers on the [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) winds about [#productmanagement](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanagement) being obsolete. The idea that if you have a strong [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) in [#scrum](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/scrum), there is no need for a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) at all.

    To explore this concept, we invited Ralph Jocham - a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) and [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) expert - to talk about the differences between product ownership and [product management]({{< ref "/categories/product-management" >}}) and whether these whispers held any truth.

    In this month's edition of [#agileactually](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileactually), Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) for a life coach to present themselves as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) to organizations.

    In most cases, an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) or [#agilecosultant](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecosultant) will have years of experience as an [#agilepractitioner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilepractitioner), actively working in an [#agileteam](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteam), followed by certification and practise as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) leading multiple [#agileteams](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteams) in multiple applications.

    That's why it's controversial that someone with very little [#professionalcoaching](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/professionalcoaching) skills and [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach).

    Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly?
