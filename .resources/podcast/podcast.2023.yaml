    Some interesting insights from two experts who are both Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Trainers in addition to agile coaches and agile consultants, and how the rise of remote work has impacted the effectiveness of training, [coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}), and consulting. It may surprise you.

    In this month's episode of Agile Actually, we picked up some whispers on the [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) winds about [#productmanagement](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanagement) being obsolete. The idea that if you have a strong [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) in [#scrum](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/scrum), there is no need for a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) at all.

    To explore this concept, we invited Ralph Jocham - a [#productmanager](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productmanager) and [#productowner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productowner) expert - to talk about the differences between product ownership and [product management]({{< ref "/categories/product-management" >}}) and whether these whispers held any truth.

    In this month's edition of [#agileactually](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileactually), Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) for a life coach to present themselves as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) to organizations.

    In most cases, an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) or [#agilecosultant](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecosultant) will have years of experience as an [#agilepractitioner](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilepractitioner), actively working in an [#agileteam](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteam), followed by certification and practise as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach) leading multiple [#agileteams](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agileteams) in multiple applications.

    That's why it's controversial that someone with very little [#professionalcoaching](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/professionalcoaching) skills and [#agile](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agile) knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an [#agilecoach](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/agilecoach).

    Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly?
